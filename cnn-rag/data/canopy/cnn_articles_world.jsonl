{"id": "2024_06_27_style_miss-ai-beauty-pageant-scli", "text": "Ten women participating in a beauty pageant is nothing new. Some pose candidly, some play to the camera, their beauty forever frozen in this moment in time. Like many other pageants held\u00a0in countries around the world,\u00a0the contestants are young, thin and\u00a0embody many of the standards defining traditional \u201cbeauty.\u201d But that is where the similarities to a traditional beauty pageant end. None of these women are real \u2014 everything about them, even the emotion that flickers across their faces, is generated by artificial intelligence (AI), for the world\u2019s first ever AI beauty pageant. Each has a creator or team of creators, who use programmes like Open AI\u2019s DALL\u00b7E 3, Midjourney or Stable Diffusion to generate images of the women from text prompts. These 10 contestants have been selected from a pool of more than 1,500 entrants to make the final of \u201cMiss AI,\u201d scheduled to be held at the end of June and broadcast online by its organizers \u201cThe World AI Creator Awards.\u201d For those involved, the event is an opportunity to showcase and demystify the technology\u2019s extraordinary abilities. But for others, it represents a further proliferation of unrealistic beauty standards often linked to racial and gender stereotypes and fueled by the ever-increasing number of digitally enhanced images online. \u201cI think we\u2019re starting to increasingly lose touch with what an unedited face looks like,\u201d Dr Kerry McInerney, a research associate at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, told CNN in a video interview. Each of the contestants has a unique and distinctive personality, as well as face. One red-haired, green-eyed avatar named Seren Ay poses for Instagram photos as she travels around the world and through time, appearing next to Turkey\u2019s first president Kemal Ataturk, on the Oscars red carpet or wandering through the neon-lit streets of Kyoto, Japan at night. And like real life pageant contestants, some AI avatars promote specific causes. One, named Aiyana Rainbow, posts in support of the LGBTQ community, her allyship literally displayed by her rainbow-colored hair, and name. Another, Anne Kerdi, posts about cleaning the oceans, her native region of Brittany in France and travelling. Zara Shatavari, posts tips on her blog for dealing with depression or strategies for losing \u201cstubborn belly fat.\u201d All are beautiful. But, echoing the reality of most modern Miss USA beauty pageant winners since the competition\u2019s inception in 1921, most are White, thin and have long hair and symmetrical features, detailed Hilary Levey Friedman \u2014 a sociologist and author of \u201cHere She Is: The Complicated Reign of the Beauty Pageant in America\u201d \u2014 in a phone interview.   Racial and gender biases ingrained within beauty standards also seep into programmes that use AI to generate images \u2014 since they have \u201clearned\u201d from the troves of data on the Internet that already contain these biases. As such, research has found that AI reflects these gender and racial stereotypes when generating images, reducing beauty into a homogenous ideal. To reflect standards, or to challenge them? Most of the models on the \u201cMiss AI\u201d shortlist, McInerney said, are \u201cvery very light-skinned and the vast majority are still White women, still thin, still really not diverging very much from that norm.\u201d \u201cThese tools are made to replicate and scale up existing patterns in the world,\u201d she added.  \u201cThey\u2019re not made necessarily to challenge them, even if they\u2019re sold as tools that enhance creativity so when it comes to beauty norms\u2026 They\u2019re capturing the existing beauty norms we have which are actively sexist, actively fatphobic, actively colorist, then they\u2019re compling and reiterating them.\u201d Open AI has acknowledged that it finds \u201cDALL-E 3 defaults to generating images of people that match stereotypical and conventional ideals of beauty.\u201d But while AI images can perpetuate these standards, some argue the technology doesn\u2019t represent a completely new phenomenon due to the huge number of digitally edited images online, enhanced by filters or airbrushing. \u201cWhen we look at the beauty standards of influencers, they are not real as well\u2026\u201d Furkan Sahin, one of Seren Ay\u2019s creators told CNN in a video interview. \u201cThey look perfect, it\u2019s like an AI.\u201d Though judge Sally-Ann Fawcett acknowledged \u201cthere\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview that \u201cwe wanted women who are more diverse in every way, in size, in age, in flaws\u2026 It\u2019s taken 50 years for pageants to get where they are today, with AI it can be done on fast forward.\u201d Fawcett, who has written four books about beauty pageants and is the head judge at Miss GB, added that she had \u201cdoubts\u201d when she was first approached by the competition\u2019s organizers, but that she saw it as an opportunity to shift the public perception of AI-generated women. Creators of these AI models add that the technology itself is not necessarily the problem. \u201cAI makes it perfect but perfect is how people want it,\u201d said Sahin, \u201cand we are not really changing any beauty standards.\u201d Similarly, Sof\u00eda Novales, a project manager at The Clueless Press which created the popular AI model Aitana L\u00f3pez who \u201csits\u201d on the pageant\u2019s judging panel told CNN by email that \u201cwe are not here to solve this long-standing problem.\u201d \u201cBut we aim to encourage AI personalities to be diverse and acknowledge the existing issues surrounding beauty standards.\u201d AI and robotics have long been used, often by men, to create the image of a \u201cperfect woman,\u201d said McInerney, referencing the Stepford Wives trope and the 2014 movie \u201cEx Machina.\u201d As technology becomes increasingly entwined with creating this version of an ideal woman, the in-person beauty pageant world has responded with a shift towards emphasizing authenticity, says Levey Friedman. \u201cThere\u2019s been a turn in the past decade that\u2019s really focused on be yourself, be authentic, be perfectly imperfect, all these sorts of catchphrases,\u201d she added. Such notions have found their way into pop culture too \u2014 Merriam Webster\u2019s 2023 word of the year was \u201cauthentic,\u201d partly thanks to \u201cstories and conversations about AI, celebrity culture, identity and social media,\u201d the dictionary said at the time. Rewarding more than just beauty? Competition organizers say entrants will be judged on more than just their beauty. They will earn points for their creators\u2019 use of AI tools as well as their social media influence and have to answer questions like \u201cif you could have one dream to make the world a better place what would it be?\u201d Fawcett said that she is looking for \u201csomeone with a powerful, positive message,\u201d while Novales said that they are \u201cnot just evaluating beauty, but also the technology behind it\u2026 and, above all, the backstory behind each avatar.\u201d Many of these AI avatars were originally created as marketing tools, to act in the same way as a human social media influencer might. Seren Ay was created to promote an online jewellery store when its founders found it difficult to work with human influencers, they said. Aitana L\u00f3pez, can earn up to \u20ac30,000 (around $32,000) a month from sponsored posts, Novales said. Such AI influencers have already proved their worth in recent years \u2014 one named Lil Miquela has amassed millions of Instagram followers and worked with brands like Calvin Klein and Prada. Unlike their human counterparts, they appear flawless, ageless and free of scandal. They don\u2019t need to be paid and they can be directly owned by a marketing agency or by the company whose products they are promoting. \u201cInfluencers are just behind a screen,\u201d Mohammad Talha Saray, one of Seren Ay\u2019s creators, said. \u201cThey\u2019re not real for us, they\u2019re just a girl or guy on the Internet and when you think about that, there\u2019s not much difference between AI and an influencer.\u201d Other avatars have a different story. Anne Kerdi\u2019s creator S\u00e9bastien Keranvran set out to present AI in a \u201cfun and informative way,\u201d in an attempt to counter the \u201chypothetical dystopian view\u201d of the technology and offer people the opportunity to interact with it. He told CNN by email that he created Anne from different AI systems and programmed her so that \u201cshe is free to say what she wants as long as it does not involve misinformation.\u201d \u201cIt is sometimes frustrating for me to see her on video at important events expressing a view different from mine, or writing in a way I would have imagined differently but\u2026 we each have our own free will.\u201d Both Anne Kerdi and Seren Ay exist as more than simply images for their followers who often interact with them, asking advice of Seren as if she were their \u201cbig sister,\u201d said  Sahin, or wishing Anne goodnight, said Keranvran. \u201cJust as we become attached to literary or movie characters, some people are attached to Anne,\u201d he said. \u201cShe responds affectionately and sometimes humorously when someone asks how she is doing.\u201d Creators of some AI avatars use this relationship with people for the adult entertainment industry. \u201cMiss AI\u201d is sponsored by Fanvue \u2014 a site that is similar to OnlyFans and hosts both AI and human content creators. Understanding the data that is being used to train AI avatars used for sex work is crucial, McInerney said, \u201cbecause so much of the available data out there is not only really sexist, it\u2019s also very heterosexual, it might not leave spaces for other kinds of sexual orientations, identities, experiences.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/style/miss-ai-beauty-pageant-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_middleeast_israel-gaza-rescue-operation-palestinian-family-intl-cmd", "text": "Bullet holes fleck the bloodstained walls of the Miqdad family home, in Nuseirat camp, central Gaza. CNN footage from the house shows a cream teddy bear perched on a white cupboard, with broken plastic strewn across the shelves. In another room, mother-of-four Rasha Abdel Miqdad shudders with grief, before breaking down in tears. \u201cThis is the blood of my son, Yamen. May God bless his soul,\u201d the 32-year-old Palestinian told CNN on June 12. \u201cMy son was innocent. \u201cWe are civilians, and we have no connection to the resistance or anything or any faction. We have no connection to it at all.\u201d CNN spoke to seven members of the family who described a horror-filled haze of gunfire, tank artillery and aerial bombardment around their home on June 8. Israeli forces stormed through the building searching for militants and indiscriminately spraying bullets, according to the family members. Four people suffered gunshot wounds, leaving one child severely injured and 12-year-old Yamen dead, the family alleged to CNN. Soldiers interrogated and beat male relatives, and forced a child to strip, relatives claimed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released footage on June 16 showing forces in the Miqdad\u2019s house on the same day as a\u00a0high-profile hostage rescue operation\u00a0nearby. In the heavily edited video, shared on social media and described as forces \u201csecuring the area\u201d during the operation, members of the Israeli Paratroopers Reconnaissance Battalion appear to enter the home. The video does not show what happened on the third floor, where the family say they were attacked. CNN has reached out to the IDF but has not received a response to the specific allegations made. The allegations provide a window into the scale and force of this\u00a0Israeli\u00a0operation\u00a0to free hostages taken during the attack on Israel last October. Eyewitnesses say they are still traumatized, after more than 270 Palestinians were killed and another 698 people injured on June 8, according to authorities in Gaza. Health staff said that hospitals, already stretched beyond their limits, were completely overwhelmed. These extremely high reported casualty tolls prompted renewed warnings from human rights organizations who say Israel is not doing enough to protect civilians as it prosecutes its war, and that militants are endangering Palestinian lives. The UN human rights office (OHCHR)\u00a0warned that\u00a0Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups may have committed war crimes through their actions. OHCHR spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the Israeli operation \u201cseriously calls into question whether the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution\u2026 were respected\u201d and that, by holding hostages in densely populated areas, Palestinian armed groups are \u201cputting the lives of Palestinian civilians, as well as the hostages themselves, at added risk.\u201d It was not clear how many of those killed were militants. The Ministry of Health in Gaza does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. But the ministry said many of those impacted were women and children, as well as people recently displaced by Israel\u2019s offensive in the southern city\u00a0of Rafah. The IDF has disputed the ministry\u2019s numbers, claiming that casualties from the operation were \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the casualty figures given by either side. The IDF said special forces teams launched the rescue operation in Nuseirat camp just after 11 a.m. local time, and by 11:25 a.m. had begun\u00a0raids\u00a0on both buildings where hostages were being held. After exchanging heavy fire with militants, and as the surrounding area came under intense Israeli missile and rocket fire, the special forces retrieved the hostages then started to travel out of the camp, toward an area near the US military\u2019s floating pier on the Mediterranean coast. It was along this route that Israeli forces stormed the Miqdad family house for between 30 and 45 minutes, according to eyewitness accounts corresponding with videos analyzed by CNN. Flames and plumes of smoke billow over wrecked vehicles in the aftermath of the operation, according to footage taken at 1:10 p.m. local time and obtained by CNN. Civilians wail over bodies heaped on top of each other, as young children look up to the sky in disbelief. In one frame, filmed on a nearby street, members of the Miqdad family can be seen carrying their injured children into a car as Israeli drones buzz overhead. The Miqdad family home, which a CNN team visited later, stands just under a mile (1.5 km) from the site where the hostages were held, as determined by CNN through video analysis. \u201cThey left nothing behind. It\u2019s all destroyed,\u201d said the mother Rasha, speaking fourtwo days after the operation. \u201cThe room is full of blood. My children\u2019s clothes are all blood. \u201cThere is no safe place\u2026 no place where we can protect ourselves.\u201d Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed 37,658 Palestinians and injured at least another 86,237 people, according to Gaza health officials. \u2018Felt like an earthquake\u2019 Artillery and missile fire erupted near the Miqdad family home before the Israeli forces entered on June 8, the father, Mohammad, told CNN. He said he gathered his family \u2013 some 14 people, mostly women and children \u2013 into a room. The family trembled with fear as the voices of soldiers grew closer, until, they claim, the troops kicked down the door, opened indiscriminate fire, threw stun grenades and pointed weapons at some of the children. \u201cThey came to the apartment we were at, and started shooting and saying, \u2018Who is here, who is here?\u2019 We told them we were civilians, children and women,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Rasha told CNN the raid \u201cfelt like an earthquake,\u201d adding that soldiers confiscated their cell phones. \u201cThey carried weapons, pointing them at an eight-month-old baby and a four-month-old baby.\u201d Israeli troops detained the two men present and demanded to know whether there were any militants in the building, Mohammad said. He and his father-in-law, Abdul Raouf, 58, tried to declare their innocence. Then, they allege, soldiers forced bags over their heads, tied their hands behind their backs and physically assaulted them. Mohammad\u2019s second oldest child, Ahmad, is still reeling from the attack. The 13-year-old told CNN he could hear the soldiers beating his father and grandfather in the hallway, before he claims he was himself forced to strip. Soldiers then told him to put his clothes back on, he said, before he was taken out of the room and \u201cpunched,\u201d pointing to his face. \u201cHe asked me to take off my clothes to make sure I was a little boy,\u201d Ahmad recalled. \u201cHe threw me to the ground and put blindfolds on me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wanted to tie me, but I started kicking with my feet, so he put his shoe here,\u201d he said, pointing to his neck, \u201cand stepped on me to silence me. \u201cThey meant to kill me.\u201d Mohammad told CNN that before the Israeli forces withdrew, they threatened to shoot his relatives, after which he heard gunshots. \u201cThe soldier said, \u2018If you don\u2019t tell me where the resistance fighters are and where the weapon is in your house, I will kill your children,\u2019\u201d Mohammad said. \u201cHe went to the room,\u201d he said, referring to the part of the house where the women and children were, adding, \u201cA minute after, and I heard the gunshots.\u201d Ahmad told CNN: \u201cAt that moment, we assumed my brothers had been killed.\u201d It is not clear if any of the family members were hit in the second round of shooting. Bullet casings that appear in a video filmed by CNN at the house are stamped with IMI, which denotes the Israeli weapons manufacturer Israeli Military Industries, according to two weapons experts, Richard Weir, senior researcher in the Crisis and Conflict division at Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member. One casing is a 9mm caliber, likely a pistol, or a machine pistol or a submachine gun, Weir said. Israeli forces were in the house for up to 45 minutes, family members told CNN. When they eventually left, Mohammad, still blindfolded, says he called on Rasha to remove the bag over his head. They say their two sons were limp and bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds. One of their children, Mumen, 16, says he was shot in his shoulder and abdomen, while his younger brother, Yamen, 12, had bullet injuries to his abdomen and leg. \u201cI called the ambulance, but they said they cannot come because the area is dangerous,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Instead, the family raced north by car to Al-Awda Hospital. But for Yamen, it was too late. \u201cThey gave him CPR for 10 minutes, but he was already martyred,\u201d Mohammad said. Scenes of \u2018massacre\u2019 at local hospitals The footage obtained by CNN from the area shows survivors clambering over rubble as missiles streak across the sky. Entire buildings are hollowed out. Palestinian men and boys delicately cover dead bodies with blankets, trying to give dignity to those killed in the Israeli\u00a0operation. Hospital workers say they could not manage the flood of casualties from the daytime raid, which was carried out when the streets and market were busy with people. At least 250 Palestinians wounded in Nuseirat were transferred from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital to Nasser Hospital, according to health authorities. Al-Aqsa hospital is serving nearly five times the number of in-patients it had pre-war with just one functioning electricity generator, the UN\u2019s Office for Humanitarian Affairs reported\u00a0on June 10. Footage from\u00a0the hospital courtyard\u00a0taken on June 8 shows trucks lined with shrouded bodies and men trying to comfort shellshocked children, as scores of Palestinians clamor to get seen by medics. \u201cThere were many martyrs lying in the streets,\u201d said Rasha\u2019s mother, 54. \u201cThe street was full of people and the planes were shooting.\u201d Critical shortages of resources including painkillers at Al-Aqsa hospital hampered efforts to treat trauma wounds \u2013 including severe burns, open fractures, amputations and brain injuries, aid workers with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, told CNN.\u00a0Israel\u2019s siege\u00a0of Gaza has drastically reduced the entry of medical and other supplies. \u201cIt was just like a plane crash had happened,\u201d said Karin Huster, an MSF staffer who treated patients in the hours after the attack. \u201cPretty much everybody was on the floor, kids, women\u2026 hundreds of people. \u201cIt takes a special kind of people to survive this,\u201d she told CNN on June 11. Another health worker at Al-Aqsa hospital, Maryame El Abbassi, said she is emotionally scarred after treating a severely burned child whose face \u201cwas melting\u201d between her hands. \u201cI wish I wouldn\u2019t have experienced the massacre,\u201d the 23-year-old nurse told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t think they invented any words that can describe how cruel the situation was\u2026 There were so many children brought in by strangers. \u201cThose kids will be traumatized until the end of their life,\u201d she said. Mumen, who is still being treated for wounds to his shoulder and abdomen, having been moved to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, drew in labored breaths as he recalled what happened to his brother. \u201cMy younger brother, Yamen, I saw them shooting him,\u201d Mumen said on June 10. \u201cThey came into the room and simply shot us, without saying a word\u2026 My future is gone. My life is gone.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/middleeast/israel-gaza-rescue-operation-palestinian-family-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_middleeast_israel-lebanon-hezbollah-analysis-intl-latam-hnk", "text": "\u201cWe can plunge Lebanon completely into the dark and take apart Hezbollah\u2019s power in days,\u201d\u00a0former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz\u00a0declared Tuesday\u00a0at a conference at Reichman University in\u00a0Herzliya, Israel. It was just the latest threat from a prominent Israeli public figure against Lebanon and\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0as tensions flare. It won\u2019t be difficult for Israel to plunge Lebanon into darkness. The country\u2019s power grid, already crippled by decades of mismanagement and the country\u2019s economic collapse, barely functions as it is. A few\u00a0well-aimed\u00a0airstrikes\u00a0will easily finish it off. Taking apart\u00a0Hezbollah\u2019s\u00a0military power in days, however, is a far taller task. Since its inconclusive 2006 war with the\u00a0Lebanese militant group, Israel has been planning for a re-match. Hezbollah too\u00a0has long been preparing for war. Its arsenal includes, according to Israeli estimates, at least 150,000 missiles and rockets. Israel estimates the group has already fired 5,000 since October, which means, as\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech last week, much of its arsenal remains intact. CNN has reported that Israeli officials have been surprised by the sophistication of the\u00a0militant group\u2019s\u00a0attacks. These include systematic pinpoint strikes on Israel\u2019s array of surveillance outposts along the border, shooting down high-flying top-of-the-line Israeli drones, and hits on Israel\u2019s Iron Dome batteries and anti-drone\u00a0defenses. Perhaps the biggest surprise for Israel, however, was the nine minutes of\u00a0drone footage\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0published\u00a0online\u00a0of highly sensitive civilian and military infrastructure in and around the northern city of Haifa. Highly trained and disciplined In addition to its\u00a0weaponry, Hezbollah\u00a0can\u00a0probably\u00a0field between 40,000 and 50,000 fighters \u2013 Nasrallah recently said more than 100,000. Many of these gained combat experience fighting\u00a0alongside\u00a0regime forces in the Syria civil war. As a fighting force,\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0is highly trained and disciplined,\u00a0unlike many other guerrilla groups.\u00a0During the 2006\u00a0war, in the experience of this correspondent, it was rare to encounter Hezbollah\u00a0fighters. One day we came upon several of them in the ruins of a southern Lebanese village. They were polite but firm, devoid of boastful bluster and swagger, insisting we leave immediately for our own safety. They wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. Unlike Gaza, Lebanon is not hemmed in by hostile\u00a0neighbors. It has strategic depth, with friendly regimes in Syria and Iraq, allowing direct access to Iran. Over the years Israel has regularly struck targets in Syria it believed were involved in trans-shipment of weapons to\u00a0Hezbollah, but all indications are those strikes have been only partially successful. In the event of war, full-scale war, both sides will be able to inflict significant pain on the other. Fire and blood Early this year the same Reichman University, where Gantz spoke, put out a report entitled \u201cFire and blood: The chilling reality facing Israel in a war with Hezbollah.\u201d\u00a0It laid out a grim scenario in which the Iranian-allied group would fire 2,500 to 3,000 rockets and missiles a day for weeks targeting Israeli military sites as well as densely populated cities in the\u00a0center\u00a0of the country. In the entire 34-day war\u00a0of\u00a02006\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0is estimated to have fired around 4,000 rockets \u2013 a daily average of 117. It may not amount to mutually assured destruction a la Cold War, but enough destruction will be wreaked on Israel and Lebanon to make it costly for both. At\u00a06 a.m.\u00a0on\u00a0July 13, 2006 \u2013\u00a0less than 24 hours after the start of the war \u2013 Israeli warplanes bombed and knocked out Beirut\u2019s Rafic Hariri International Airport. It\u2019s widely expected that if war breaks out now the airport will be one of Israel\u2019s targets. But unlike 2006, in 2024\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0may be able to hit Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport. In 2006, Haifa, Israel\u2019s third largest city, was in range of\u00a0Hezbollah\u2019s\u00a0missiles. This time those missiles are expected to reach much deeper into Israel. Shifting strategic balance Looking across the Middle East, the strategic balance that for so long\u00a0favored\u00a0Israel is changing. Its foes are no longer corrupt and incompetent Arab regimes, but rather an array of non-state actors \u2013 from\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0to Hamas to Islamic Jihad to the Houthis to militias in Iraq and Syria \u2013 in addition to Iran itself. And because of US support for Israel, all of these players also have the US, and\u00a0Western\u00a0interests in the Middle East, in their crosshairs.\u00a0US support was\u00a0underscored by recent CNN reporting that Washington has assured Israel of its backing in the event of full-scale war with\u00a0Hezbollah. The Houthis in Yemen, once the epitome of a rag-tag tribal militia, are now, with Iran\u2019s help, firing ballistic missiles toward Israel. The Houthis continue to target shipping in the Red Sea, despite the presence of a US-led armada off its shores. The Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have largely held their fire since a series of US strikes in the aftermath of a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan. But that could change if Israel and Hezbollah go to war. Recently\u00a0Qais Al-Khazali, the leader of the powerful Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Asa\u2019ib Ahl Al-Haq, warned that if the US supports an\u00a0Israeli\u00a0attack on Lebanon \u201cthen America should know that it will put all its interests in the region, particularly in Iraq, at risk and make them a\u00a0target.\u201d Throwing caution to the wind And then there\u2019s Iran.\u00a0Traditionally Tehran lets others fight its fights and stays in the background, but that changed in April when, in retaliation for the Israeli strike on its diplomatic complex in Damascus, Tehran responded with a volley of hundreds of missiles and drones toward Israel. In the event\u00a0Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s premier regional ally, its crown jewel, is attacked by Israel, and indeed is \u201ctaken apart\u201d by Israel as Gantz threatened, an Iranian response is likely. It could merely instruct its allies to throw\u00a0caution\u00a0to the wind and fire at will at US interests and Israel. But then there\u2019s this: Iran sits on the\u00a0Strait\u00a0of Hormuz, the entry point into the Persian Gulf. In the event of a major conflict, it has long been feared that Iran would block the\u00a0strait, a move that would send world oil prices skyrocketing. Since\u00a0October,\u00a0tensions on the Lebanon-Israel border have fluctuated. In the last few weeks, however, those tensions have escalated and war is looking ever more likely. The rhetoric on both sides is heating up. Germany, Sweden, Kuwait, the Netherlands and others are calling on their nationals to leave Lebanon immediately.

{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-ultra-orthodox-draft-explainer-intl", "text": "The Israeli Supreme Court issued a ruling on Tuesday ordering the government to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military. Since Israel\u2019s founding, ultra-Orthodox Jews have been exempt from mandatory military service. The court also said that the government could no longer fund any religious schools (called \u201cyeshivas\u201d) whose students don\u2019t participate in the draft. Though both men and women are subject to Israel\u2019s mandatory conscription, the ruling only applies to ultra-Orthodox men. Who are the ultra-Orthodox? The ultra-Orthodox, known as \u201cHaredim,\u201d in Hebrew, practice a form of Judaism that is marked by stringent religious observance and strict lifestyles. They make up around 14% of Israel\u2019s 9.5 million citizens, and are the fastest-growing segment of the population. Because they are disproportionately young, they make up 24% of recruitment-age Israelis, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. Why don\u2019t they serve in the military? Some do, but far fewer than most Israeli Jews. The vast majority do not participate in the country\u2019s mandatory military service. For ultra-Orthodox men, studying Judaism\u2019s religious texts is central not only to their own lives but \u2013 they believe \u2013\u00a0the preservation of all of Judaism, and even the defense of Israel. Torah study begins in the teenage years and often continues into young adulthood. It is a full-time pursuit that precludes secular study, participating in the workforce (and therefore paying taxes) \u2013 or serving in the military, as most non-ultra-Orthodox Israeli Jews do. Technically, the military service exemption applied to young men who were actively studying at a yeshiva. In practice, anyone who tells a recruiter that he studies at yeshiva \u2013 anyone who presents themselves to be ultra-Orthodox \u2013\u202fcan get out of service. \u201cThe Jewish people survived persecutions, pogroms and wars only thanks to the preservation of their uniqueness \u2013 the Torah and the mitzvot,\u201d the head of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Shas party said on Tuesday, referring to the 613 commandments that rule orthodox Jewish life. \u201cThis is our secret weapon against all enemies, as promised by the Creator of the world. Even here, in the Jewish state, alongside our precious fighters who sacrifice their lives against the enemies, we will continue to guard those who learn the Torah, which preserves our special power and creates miracles in battle.\u201d What did the Supreme Court say? In essence, the court said that the ultra-Orthodox could not be treated differently from other Israeli Jews. The law that mandates military service, it said, also applies to them. (Palestinian citizens of Israel remain exempt from service.) \u201cThere is no legal framework that makes it possible to distinguish between yeshiva students and those destined for military service,\u201d the court said in its ruling. The government \u201cseriously harmed the rule of law and the principle according to which all individuals are equal before the law.\u201d Why is it important now? The fight over whether the ultra-Orthodox should serve in the military is nothing new. Their exemption is as old as the state of Israel itself \u2013\u00a0in place from its founding in 1948. The Supreme Court ripped up that longstanding rule 50 years later, telling the government that allowing the ultra-Orthodox to get out of conscription violated equal protection principles. In the decades since, successive governments and Knessets (the Israeli parliament) have tried to solve the issue, only to be told repeatedly by the court that their efforts were illegal. The latest government attempt to paper over the problem, in place since 2018, expired at the end of March. It of course took on new significance on October 7, when Hamas and other militant groups crossed over from Gaza and killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, and took hundreds captive. The months since have put incredible strain on Israel\u2019s military, and particularly on the reservists who have been called up for extended tours of duty. Growing fears of a full-scale war with Lebanon only add to those worries. Ultra-Orthodox politicians argue that the fight over getting them to serve is being used a political bludgeon, and that the military has no manpower problem. The Israel Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) leaders disagree. \u201cWe want to move forward, not because it\u2019s nice, [but] first of all because it\u2019s necessary,\u201d IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said recently. \u201cEvery such battalion that we establish, an ultra-Orthodox battalion, decreases the need for the deployment of many thousands of reservists thanks to the mandatory service people.\u201d The ultra-Orthodox service exemption has also stoked resentment among Israelis who have spent months away from their families while serving in the military, and seen loved ones killed. It has further opened the religious-secular divide in Israel that has always been present, but has grown, especially as the ultra-Orthodox share of the population increases. What does it mean for the war? In the short term, probably very little. Because the ultra-Orthodox have such strict religious practices, they usually serve in special units. The IDF is working to expand those units, but it will take time. \u201cAccording to the calculations of the army, there were 1,800 that were conscripted last year,\u201d Gilad Malach, director of the Ultra-Orthodox in Israel program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said after Tuesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe army needs to do some change in order to conscript them. According to the army, next year the army can receive 4,800.\u201d Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General Gil Limon instructed the government on Tuesday to immediately begin recruitment of an additional 3,000 ultra-Orthodox men, which the military has already said it could accommodate. He also that that \u201cin light of the current needs of the army and to promote equality in the burden,\u201d the military must \u201cdevelop and present a recruitment plan to increase this number.\u201d Where it could have a bigger impact is if it causes Israel\u2019s governing coalition to fall apart, which is entirely possible. Why is this ruling bad news for Netanyahu? When Netanyahu formed his government coalition in late 2022, he included two ultra-Orthodox parties \u2013 Shas and United Torah Judaism \u2013 to form a thin majority. Because yeshiva study is so important to those parties, this ruling could have big ramifications. For the moment, they seem to be downplaying the decision, saying they have no plans to pull out of the coalition. Despite the court\u2019s ruling, the ultra-Orthodox parties are still trying to pass legislation in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, that would enshrine the draft exemption in law. Because the IDF doesn\u2019t have the capacity yet to draft the ultra-Orthodox into special units, it\u2019s unlikely that many will be drafted anytime soon. Once those draft orders start going out, the court\u2019s order for the government to stop funding yeshivas whose students refuse to serve could have a big impact \u2013\u00a0and affect whether the ultra-Orthodox party leaders still think there\u2019s benefit to being part of the government. What comes next? This story has been full of endless twists and turns. It will almost certainly not be the final word. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, along with his ultra-Orthodox allies, will continue to try to pass a law enshrining the draft exemption in law. But as the past decades have proven, there is little guarantee that they will be able to do that in a way that satisfies the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/israel-ultra-orthodox-draft-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_tech_snapchat-teen-sextortion-prevention-safety", "text": "Snapchat is working to make it harder for teenagers to be contacted on the app by people they don\u2019t know, its latest effort to stop the sexual and financial exploitation scam known as sextortion. The company on Tuesday announced a set of new safety features, including expanded warning pop-ups that appear when a teen receives a message from someone they don\u2019t share mutual friends with or have in their contacts. Now, teens will also receive a warning message if they receive a chat from a user who has been blocked or reported by others or who is from a region where the teen\u2019s other contacts aren\u2019t located, \u201csigns that the person may be a scammer,\u201d Snapchat said in a blog post Tuesday. And Snapchat will now prevent the delivery of friend requests for teens to or from an account that they don\u2019t share mutual friends with that is also located in regions often associated with scammers. In addition to expanding Snapchat\u2019s broader suite of youth safety measures, the new features are aimed specifically at preventing financial sextortion, a worrying and growing type of scam across social media where bad actors gain the trust of young users, convince them to send sexual or explicit photos and then demand payment in exchange for keeping the pictures a secret. \u201cThese features were designed to better protect teens from potential online harms and to enhance the real-friend connections that make Snapchat so unique,\u201d Snap\u2019s Global Head of Platform Safety Jacqueline Beauchere said in an exclusive statement to CNN ahead of the announcement. Law enforcement officials have in recent years warned of an uptick in online sextortion scams, in which bad actors, typically located overseas, target children and teens, often with profiles that appear to belong to friendly fellow teenagers. In some cases, sextortion has resulted in suicides. Meta in April also announced new features aimed at combating sextortion, including informing users when they\u2019ve interacted with someone who engaged in financial sextortion. And the chief executives of Meta and Snap, along with other social media leaders, were called to testify earlier this year in a Senate subcommittee hearing about their efforts to protect young people from online exploitation. Also among Snapchat\u2019s announcements on Tuesday are improvements to the app\u2019s blocking tools, which will prevent users from simply creating new accounts to get around a block. Now, when a user blocks another account, any new accounts created on the same device will also automatically be blocked. Snapchat is also introducing more frequent reminders to all users, including teens, about their location settings on the app\u2019s \u201cSnap Map\u201d feature, which is toggled off by default but which users can update to share their location live with friends. The company said it will make it possible for users to update their location settings, remove their location from the map and customize which friends they share their location with \u2013 all in one spot on the app. The updates build on Snapchat\u2019s existing teen safety features, which include a \u201cFamily Center\u201d where parents can supervise the behavior of 13- to 17-year-old users, and mechanisms for removing age-inappropriate content. Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 (or 800-273-8255) to connect with a trained counselor or visit the\u00a0NSPL site.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/tech/snapchat-teen-sextortion-prevention-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

The retail toy brand premiered a short promo film at the 2024 Cannes Lions Festival in France this week that was created almost entirely by using OpenAI\u2019s new text-to-video tool. The company\u2019s entertainment studio partnered with creative agency Native Foreign, which had early access to Sora. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said it believes it is the first brand to debut a film using the technology. The tool is not yet publicly available. The 66-second promo follows a young Toys \u201cR\u201d Us founder, Charles Lazarus, who had a vision to transform toy stores with the help of the brand\u2019s mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe, who came to him in a dream. Reactions to the clip were mixed on social media, with some calling it a compelling, fascinating look into the future of film; others called it \u201ccreepy.\u201d Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said that in addition to Sora, it used some corrective visual effects and an original music score. In February, OpenAI \u2013 the company behind the viral ChatGPT chatbot \u2013 introduced the AI model Sora which it claimed can create realistic and imaginative videos from quick text prompts. It said the tool is capable of generating videos up to 60 seconds and can serve up scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion and detailed background details. Following the announcement, experts said text-to-video types of AI models could have the potential to disrupt the digital entertainment market. Kim Miller, CMO of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Creative studios, told CNN the concept was born after she attended a brand storytelling group and told the host she wanted to do something \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d for their next project, which involved the origin story of the founder. After Native Foreign became an early tester of Sora, chief creative officer Nik Kleverov, chief creative officer called Miller with the proposal to join forces. \u201cEverything you see was created with text but some shots came together quicker than others; some took more iterations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe blocking, the way the character looks, what they\u2019re wearing, the emotion, the background \u2013 it has to be a perfect dance. Sometimes you would create something that was almost right and other times not so right.\u201d Miller said there was also a lot of gut checking and human involvement throughout the process. \u201cSometimes it would check a box, but maybe a reaction wouldn\u2019t\u00a0be on time with what was going on,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a lot of learning and a lot of back and forth. It was an educational process.\u201d Miller, who was an early adopter of Facebook Live when she worked with Martha Stewart, believes the best way to understand technology is to actually experience it, rather than just going off what you\u2019re hearing from other people. \u201cThe same is true for AI,\u201d she said. She added Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is currently exploring advertising opportunities for the promo. \u201cOur big mission is to make sure everyone knows there is a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us in every Macy\u2019s, so there may be a holiday iteration of it coming soon,\u201d Miller said.

{"id": "2024_06_27_style_thom-browne-couture-show-2024", "text": "True to his theatrical form, Thom Browne\u2019s fall 2024 couture show opened with spectacle. Men grasping a rope battled for supremacy in a staged game of tug of war at the hallowed \u201cMus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs\u201d gallery in Paris, where the American designer riffed off the upcoming Olympic Games to tell a story about sports, old-world couture and camp. Quoting both antiquity and American myths, models replicated stereotypical poses of athletes throughout time \u2014 from archers and disc throwers to weightlifters \u2014 playfully deconstructing both gender roles and classical tailoring. The latter molded bodies into exaggerated shoulder lines and tiny waists reminiscent of vintage sport iconography. Tennis skirts and dramatic heel-less track boots, complete with laurel wreath headdresses paved the way for playful homages to France: dresses adorned with hand-painted blue swimming briefs or red bikinis (the two-piece was invented in France in 1946) and beaded \u2018tricolore\u2019 lapels on jackets and overcoats. Browne launched his label in 2001 in New York\u2019s West Village, first operating by appointment only, and has since won the CFDA Menswear Designer Award in 2006, 2012, and again in 2016. His collections have been coveted by celebrities, collectors and museums. Thom Browne (which has, since 2018, been part of Zegna group who own a 90% stake) is also a ready-to-wear business currently offered in over 300 department-stores and boutiques across 40 countries, as well as in 110 Thom Browne retail stores.\u00a0\u201cI have a very successful commercial side of my business,\u201d Browne explained in an interview with CNN backstage. \u201c(Couture) balances the other side of what I do.\u201d As is the way with Browne, the show was an entertaining and playful vehicle to exhibit traditional couture techniques. \u201cI like to tell a story,\u201d he explained. \u201cI like to entertain and to ground it in beautifully made clothes.\u201d Perhaps surprisingly for a couture collection, it was muslin \u2014 the simple, lightweight cotton used to create initial mock-ups of clothes (called \u201ctoiles\u201d) at ateliers \u2014 that comprised much of Browne\u2019s finished pieces. To quote the show-notes: \u201cThe toile as the source text\u2026 The toile as the finale garment\u2026 The work-in-progress becomes the final work\u2026 Couture.\u201d Using exposed stitching as well as ancient techniques including hand-basting (an intricate and ancient method used by artisans when working with delicate fabric or to create precise alignments), the designer\u2019s aim, he said, was to play with tailoring and proportions. Jared Ellner, a celebrity stylist who dressed influencer Emma Chamberlain and actor Molly Gordon for the show and regularly works with singer Sabrina Carpenter said of Thom Browne: \u201cIt\u2019s so easily and instantly recognizable, yet pushes barriers aesthetically\u2026 Never making everyone look the same but allowing each person to add their own style to it\u2026\u00a0(Sabrina and Emma) like to dress up like a character\u2026\u00a0really pushing their own individuality.\u201d And at a time when most discreet details are lost on camera, perhaps that could be the ultimate luxury.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/style/thom-browne-couture-show-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Taylor Casey was last seen on June 19 around Paradise Island, a small resort enclave just off the shore of the island of New Providence, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said. The organizers of the retreat asked Bahamian police to investigate, according to a statement from the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat obtained by CNN on Tuesday. The retreat learned of Casey\u2019s disappearance when she failed to attend morning classes, according to the statement. She was last seen late on the evening of June 19 and the \u201corganization has also advised the US Embassy as well as Taylor Casey\u2019s family,\u201d the statement said. A missing person flyer released by police did not provide details of the circumstances of her disappearance or say whether foul play is suspected. Authorities said Wednesday that they found Casey\u2019s cellphone in the waters, but it\u2019s unclear the distance it was from the yoga retreat. \u201cWe have conducted extensive investigation into the matter,\u201d Royal Bahamas Police Force Chief Superintendent Chrislyn Skippings said in a press conference Wednesday. \u201cOur priority is to find Taylor and to find Taylor in good health.\u201d Skippings said police have utilized drones, search-and-rescue dogs and divers in the investigation. They are also working with Casey\u2019s family, checking CCTV cameras and interviewing retreat attendees, Skippings said. Casey\u2019s family is pleading with the public for help finding her and urging anyone with information to contact police in the Bahamas. \u201cWe are deeply concerned for Taylor\u2019s safety and well-being,\u201d said Casey\u2019s mother, Colette Seymore, in a\u00a0release\u00a0posted on a\u00a0Facebook page\u00a0dedicated to locating Casey. \u201cWe love Taylor and want her home.\u201d Taylor, who has been practicing yoga for 15 years, went to the yoga retreat \u201cto fulfill a long-term goal of deepening her practice,\u201d the family said in the release. Seymore found out her daughter was missing when she received a call from the retreat where Casey was training for her yoga certification, she said in an interview with ABC\u2019s Good Morning America Wednesday. \u201cA young lady called me and said, \u2018Have you heard from Taylor?\u2019\u201d Seymore said. \u201cAnd then she said, \u2018Taylor hasn\u2019t showed up for yoga classes.\u2019\u201d \u201cA mother\u2019s intuition and answers I was getting just didn\u2019t correlate \u2013 just wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear,\u201d Seymore told ABC.

{"id": "2024_06_25_americas_boluarte-allegations-icc-crimes-against-humanity-intl-latam", "text": "Two human rights groups have made a submission to the International Criminal Court accusing Peru\u2019s President Dina Boluarte and members of her government of crimes against humanity in connection with the deaths of 49 people during the Andean country\u2019s weeks-long protest movement in 2022 and 2023. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and Peru\u2019s Association for Human Rights (APRODEH) submitted a communication to the ICC Tuesday, asking it to open a preliminary examination against Boluarte and members of her government regarding the allegations. According to the ICC, submitting a communication is the first step for it to establish if, based on available information, it appears that crimes within its jurisdiction have been committed. If it decides this is so, the court can proceed to\u00a0open a full preliminary examination. Lawyers Jimena Reyes, director of the Americas desk at FIDH, and Gloria Cano, director of APRODEH, met members of the Prosecutor\u2019s office on Tuesday and submitted documentation alleging crimes against humanity took place between December 7, 2022 and February 9, 2023, a statement released by the FIDH says. \u201cThe persons implicated in the commission of the crimes of murder and attempted murder were state authorities, including members of the Peruvian Army and the Peruvian National Police, who acted in accordance with a state policy planned or, at a minimum, approved by omission, by the highest national authorities of\u00a0Peru,\u201d\u00a0a report issued by FIDH and Aprodeh concludes. The victims \u201cwere part of a civilian population of protesters or persons perceived as such, mainly young, poor men from indigenous areas of the country\u201d the report added. CNN has reached out to the Peruvian government and the attorney representing Boluarte for comment. President Boluarte has denied any personal responsibility since the protests started while former Prime Minister Alberto Otarola said the government defended \u201cPeruvians\u2019 right to peace and calm\u201d. Apart from the victims, there were also hundreds of people injured \u201cas a result of the indiscriminate use of lethal force by the military and by the police who were in charge of patrolling the demonstrations after the declaration of a state of\u00a0emergency,\u201d\u00a0Cano told CNN. \u201cThe majority were killed while exercising their legitimate right to protest,\u201d Cano said. The victim profiles submitted to the ICC include 32-year-old Leonardo\u00a0Hancco\u00a0and 18-year-old\u00a0Beckhan Quispe, whose cases have been previously reported by CNN. Allegations of \u2018extrajudicial executions\u2019 The Andean country\u2019s weeks-long protest movement was sparked by the impeachment and arrest of former President Pedro Castillo in December 2022, fuelled by deep dissatisfaction over living conditions and inequality in the country. While protests occurred throughout the nation, the worst violence was in the rural and indigenous south. An\u00a0Amnesty International report in May 2023\u00a0found that Peruvian\u00a0security forces\u00a0carried out widespread attacks against protesters including young men and children. The report alleges the security forces took part in\u00a0\u201cextrajudicial executions \u201cand \u201cwidespread use of lethal ammunition\u201d while trying to contain the protests. Forty-nine civilians were killed,\u00a0and Amnesty International says that several of those killed were bystanders. \u201cIn none of the cases was evidence found that the deceased person posed a risk to the life or integrity of the officials,\u201d the Amnesty International report says. Peru\u2019s Prosecutor\u2019s office opened a preliminary investigation in\u00a0January 2023\u00a0against Boluarte, Otarola, and other ministers at the time for alleged genocide, homicide and serious injuries committed during the protests. Boluarte testified at a closed-door meeting last year\u00a0CNN en Espanol reported. This investigation remains open. Peru\u2019s defense and interior ministries had also been contacted for comment. Both ministries told CNN in February 2023 they could not comment until an ongoing investigation carried out by the Prosecutor\u2019s office is finished. Peruvian authorities have said that the country\u2019s security forces acted in self-defense. Last year Boluarte said that she and her ministers do not decide protocols for the Armed Forces or the Police. \u201cThey have their own law and protocols. Who do they comply with? Their commanders. We don\u2019t have any power over them. I can be the Supreme Chief of the Armed Forces, but I have no command (over them) and the protocols are decided by them,\u201d\u00a0she said. Yovana Mendoza, president of the victim\u2019s association in Ayacucho and who lost her 34-year-old brother\u00a0Jhon Mendoza, told CNN this request to the ICC\u2019s is a cry for help from the families in Peru.\u00a0She says\u00a0they have been forgotten and ignored by the authorities there. \u201cHere we don\u2019t trust the government, as they only introduce laws to protect\u00a0themselves,\u201d\u00a0she said. Ruth Barcena told CNN she is hopeful for justice with this request after the death of her husband Leonardo Hancco.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Brennon R. E. Washington, 25, was indicted on March 27 on charges of \u201cnon-consensual sexual intercourse\u201d and \u201cindecent kidnapping,\u201d a court spokesperson in Naha, Okinawa\u2019s capital, told CNN, adding that the US military handed the serviceman over to the Japanese authorities on the same day. Washington was released on bail and transferred to the Kadena US Air Base in Okinawa for custody, according to a government spokesperson. His trial will begin July 12, according to the Naha District Court spokesperson. The court\u2019s spokesperson told CNN they do not have any details regarding the airman\u2019s legal representation. The prosecution comes at a time when Washington and Tokyo are deepening their military alliance \u2013 in part as geopolitical tensions rise with both China and North Korea. The alleged rape is the latest in a history of criminal cases involving US personnel in Okinawa, home to one of the largest US foreign military bases, and could exacerbate tensions with residents who have long opposed the presence of American troops and weaponry on the island. The presence of V-22 Ospreys, a tiltrotor military aircraft, have also been a regular source of anger and protest in Okinawa following a series of recent crashes and noise complaints. Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki told reporters Tuesday the allegations of rape and kidnap were \u201cextremely regrettable,\u201d adding it was necessary \u201cto strongly protest against the US military and other related organizations.\u201d The governor also said his office will \u201ctake a tough stance in dealing with the situation.\u201d Washington, the indicted serviceman, was stationed with the 18 Logistics Readiness Squadron at the Kadena Air Base in Japan, according to the US Air Force, which confirmed his rank and service record to CNN. \u201cThe 18th Wing is aware of a sexual assault allegation against a Kadena Airman involving a Japanese citizen,\u201d 18th Wing Spokesperson, 1st Lt. Alvin G. Nelson III, told CNN Wednesday. \u201cWe understand and share the local community\u2019s concerns regarding this case,\u201d Nelson said, adding that Wing leadership was \u201cdeeply concerned by the severity of this alleged crime,\u201d and has been working with local authorities to investigate the allegations. \u201cAll US service members are expected to uphold the highest standards, and the US military is committed to holding accountable those who are convicted of criminal acts,\u201d the Wing spokesperson said. The indictment comes nearly 30 years after three US servicemen raped a 12-year-old Okinawa schoolgirl in 1995, sparking a backlash against the US military on the island. In 2016, the rape and murder of a 20-year-old woman by a former US base worker in Okinawa triggered mass protests in the island\u2019s capital, with tens of thousands of residents demanding the US move its bases outside of Okinawa.\u00a0The fallout resulted in curfews for US personnel on the island. In another crime involving US personnel in Japan, a US Navy officer killed two Japanese nationals while driving down Mount Fuji in 2021. Masataka Okano, Japan\u2019s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, called for stricter discipline and lodged a protest with the US Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, on March 27, the day Washington was indicted, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. CNN reached out to the US Embassy in Japan, which said it was aware of the case but will not comment. The embassy told CNN in a phone call to contact Kadena Air Base, where Washington was based, for information on the case. CNN has contacted Kadena Air Base for comment. Japan and the US have a mutual defense alliance and a decades old military partnership that has only been deepened in recent years by regional threats, particularly North Korea and an ever more assertive China. US President Joe Biden met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David in August 2023 in a show of solidarity and force against Beijing. In what Biden hailed as a \u201cnew era of cooperation,\u201d the three powers committed to a yearly trilateral summit, intelligence sharing and annual military exercises.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/asia/us-air-force-rape-japanese-schoolgirl-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_26_asia_north-south-korea-balloons-defector-activist-group-intl-hnk", "text": "Beside a desk scattered with soldering pieces, loose wires and electronic parts, Choi\u2019s computer screen tracks wind conditions and the GPS location of some unlikely parcels: massive \u201csmart\u201d balloons he has sent floating into North Korea. From a small apartment in South Korea\u2019s capital, Choi, who CNN is identifying by a pseudonym for his privacy and safety, is one of the parties engaged in what has become a tit-for-tat balloon feud between the two Koreas, heightening tensions on the Korean Peninsula. For many years, South Korean activists and North Korean defectors have sent balloons to the North, loaded with propaganda material criticizing dictator Kim Jong Un and\u00a0USB sticks filled with\u00a0K-pop songs and South Korean television shows\u00a0\u2013 all strictly prohibited in the impoverished, highly isolated nation. In response, North Korean authorities have sent more than 1,000 balloons toward the South since May carrying trash, waste and worms \u2013 fueling tensions as Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea\u2019s leader, warned of \u201ctrouble\u201d ahead. In 2020, South Korea passed a law criminalizing the sending of anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border as the previous liberal government in Seoul\u00a0pushed for engagement with Pyongyang. But many campaigners\u00a0defied the ruling before it was struck down by a court last year, which called the law an excessive restriction on free speech, in response to a complaint filed by North Korean defector-activists in the South. Choi, co-founder of the Committee for Reforming and Opening North Korea, is among the North Korean defectors who have vowed to continue sending balloons to their homeland. The balloons assembled by Choi\u2019s group from their Seoul apartment base are a step up from rudimentary balloons that randomly scatter their contents when they crash or pop. Fitted with GPS trackers,\u00a0the activists can monitor\u00a0these next generation \u201csmart\u201d balloons in real time on journeys that often span hundreds of kilometers.\u00a0The group once tracked one of its balloons that drifted all the way to China, according to its data. The group\u2019s oblong-shaped balloons are about 12 to 13 meters (about 40 to 42 feet) long, made of plastic and filled with hydrogen, Choi said. They carefully chose the plastic\u2019s thickness so it can both endure the wind and allow some hydrogen to naturally leak through, helping control the balloons\u2019 altitude, he added. The sensors and small circuit boards attached to the balloons help the balloons travel at a certain altitude and for a certain distance. \u201cIf the balloons float too high over 4,000 meters, the dispenser won\u2019t work properly so we keep an extra bag of leaflets to drop when it reaches too high in altitude,\u201d Choi said. \u201cIt\u2019s programmed to release the hydrogen gas depending on the altitude.\u201d \u201cI believe North Korea can change when the deification of Kim Jong Un is cracked, and sending these smart balloons is the way to achieve that,\u201d Choi added. \u201cI feel very proud that we have contributed to dismantling the idolization of Kim Jong Un.\u201d 3D-printed parts The smart balloons sent by Choi\u2019s group carry a number of different payloads, including some that are automated. In one version, the balloons carry a small, makeshift loudspeaker that looks like a camping lantern, held in place by zip ties and glue. Attached to a cushion, battery pack and a parachute, it blares propaganda as it floats to the ground, with one message declaring: \u201cNorth Korea can survive only if the Workers\u2019 Party is abolished.\u201d The balloons are sometimes fitted with an automated flyer-dispensing device. They can carry about 1,500 propaganda leaflets \u2013 which the dispenser spits out rapidly with the help of a timer and an altitude-adjusting device. \u201cWe devised a method to disperse the leaflets over a large area, covering 50 to 300 kilometers (about 31 to 186 miles), making it very difficult for North Korean authorities to collect them all,\u201d Choi said. \u201cWith our system, we can control the leaflets to fall every 300 meters or every kilometer, making sure more people can see them.\u201d These features allow the group more control over their devices than the typical balloons used by other activists. For example, smart balloons are designed to begin spitting out leaflets at specific points based on their wind speed and direction, Choi said \u2013 purportedly allowing them to distribute within target areas. They can also control the frequency of the leaflets\u2019 distribution. While Choi buys some parts for the devices, he uses 3D printers to make the others. He credits his engineering studies at a North Korean university before his escape to the South \u2013 and\u00a0YouTube videos and the rest of his group \u2013 for helping him improve upon the existing balloons being sent North, before setting up the organization in 2013. And this isn\u2019t his full-time job; he works elsewhere in the daytime, comes to the apartment after work, makes 3D-printed parts, then assembles them for up to six hours a day. Each smart balloon costs about $700 to make, he said. Choi\u2019s motivation, he said, is his family still living in North Korea. And he bristled at those in South Korea who have urged the activist groups to stop. \u201cTo those who criticize our activities, it\u2019s like saying, \u2018Let\u2019s help maintain the dictatorship in South Korea,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to\u00a0decades of authoritarianism in Seoul before the South\u2019s transition to democracy in the 1980s. Rising tensions The balloon feud has seen tensions heighten between the two Koreas, which technically remain at war \u2013 an armistice ended the Korean War that split the peninsula in 1953 but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Relations between the two countries thawed somewhat in 2017 and 2018, allowing some South Korean elements, including parts of its pop culture, to seep into the hermit nation. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years as leader Kim ramped up weapons testing in defiance of United Nations sanctions and diplomatic talks fell apart, prompting strict rules to snap back into place in the North. Meanwhile, both nations are drawing closer to their respective partners \u2013 with North Korea recently signing a defense agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0and South Korea stepping up cooperation with Japan and the United States. On Tuesday, after South Korea detected the latest batch of 350 trash balloons from North Korea, the country\u2019s military warned it could restart loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts at the border \u2013 something it hasn\u2019t done since 2018. In past years, Seoul has used giant speakers to play propaganda and music across the heavily militarized border \u2013 including news reports and K-pop group Big Bang\u2019s hit song \u201cBang Bang Bang.\u201d \u201cOur military is ready to immediately start anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts and will operate with flexibility according to the strategical and operational situation,\u201d said South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, adding that whether it resumes the loudspeakers is \u201cup to North Korea\u2019s actions.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/asia/north-south-korea-balloons-defector-activist-group-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_bird-strike-plane-what-happens", "text": "Late Monday night, Virgin Australia flight VA 148 set out from Queenstown in New Zealand bound for Melbourne. Not long after takeoff, the right engine of the Boeing 737-800 jet started\u00a0emitting loud bangs, followed by flames. The pilot flew on with the remaining engine, bringing the plane\u2019s 73 passengers and crew to a safe emergency landing at nearby Invercargill airport. Virgin Australia says the dramatic turn of events was caused by a \u201cpossible bird strike\u201d. Queenstown Airport\u00a0played down\u00a0the likelihood of bird strike, saying \u201cno birds were detected on the airfield at that time\u201d. While we don\u2019t know exactly what happened, bird strike is a common and real risk for aircraft. It can damage planes, and even lead to deaths. How common are bird strikes? A bird strike is a\u00a0collision between\u00a0an aircraft and a bird. (Though the definition is sometimes expanded to include\u00a0collisions on the ground\u00a0with land animals including deer, rabbits, dogs and alligators.) The\u00a0first bird strike\u00a0was recorded by Orville Wright in 1905, over a cornfield in Ohio. Now they happen every day, with some seasonal variability due to the\u00a0migratory patterns\u00a0of birds. Perhaps the most famous migratory bird strike occurred in 2009, when\u00a0US Airways Flight 1549\u00a0encountered a flock of migrating Canadian geese shortly after taking off from LaGuardia Airport in New York. Both of the plane\u2019s engines failed, and captain Sully Sullenberger was forced to pilot it to an unpowered landing in the Hudson River. Between 2008 and 2017, the Australian Transport Safety Board recorded\u00a016,626 bird strikes. In America, the Federal Aviation Administration reported\u00a017,200 bird strikes\u00a0in 2022 alone. Where do bird strikes happen, and what are the effects? According to the\u00a0International Civil Aviation Organization, 90% of bird strikes happen near airports. In general, this is while aircraft are taking off or landing, or flying at lower altitudes where most bird activity occurs. The effect of bird strike depends on many factors including the type of aircraft. Outcomes may include shutting down an engine, as may have happened with the Virgin Australia flight. This plane was a Boeing 737-800, which has the capability to fly on a single engine to an alternate airport. In smaller aircraft, particularly single-engine aircraft, bird strikes can be fatal. Since 1988,\u00a0262 bird strike fatalities\u00a0have been reported globally, and 250 aircraft destroyed. How do manufacturers and pilots defend against bird strike? Most\u00a0bird strikes\u00a0occur early in the morning or a sunset when birds are most active. Pilots are trained to be vigilant during these times. Radar can be used to\u00a0track flocks of birds. However, this technology is ground-based and not available worldwide so it can\u2019t be used everywhere. The two largest manufacturers of passenger jets, Boeing and Airbus, use\u00a0turbofan engines. These use a series of fan blades to compress air before adding fuel and flame to get the thrust needed to take off. Bird strike in one of these engines can cause severe damage to the fan blades, causing the engine to fail. Engine manufacturers test the safety of these engines by firing\u00a0a high-speed frozen chicken\u00a0at them while the engine is operating at full thrust. The Australian Government\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority\u00a0circular on wildlife hazard management\u00a0outlines what airports should do to keep birds and animals away from the vicinity of the airport. One technique is to use small gas explosions to mimic the sound of a shotgun to deter birds from loitering near the runway. In areas with high bird populations, airports may also use certain grasses and plants that do not attract the birds. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated\u00a0the condition of\u00a0the chicken used to test engines for bird strikes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/bird-strike-plane-what-happens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_weather_us-summer-heat-forecast-climate", "text": "Summer is off to a sweltering start after multiple record-breaking heat events sent temperatures soaring for millions of people in the US. So when will it end? Forecasts for the coming weeks and months show exceptional heat is largely here to stay, with only fleeting periods of respite. And the sobering summer reality on a planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution is the heat isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 it\u2019s only going to get more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise. \u201cSummers like the one we are experiencing now and the summer we had last year \u2013 which was the hottest on record \u2013 are going to become par for the course in the years ahead,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. A sign of things to come There will still be colder-than-average summers in the future, but climate change is making it likelier more summers will end up hotter-than-average, Dahl told CNN. And the fingerprints of a changing climate are already visible, even before summer has reached its hottest months. This spring, hundreds of cities in the eastern half of the US experienced one of their 10 hottest Mays on record in what was another sign of a changing climate: dangerous heat seeping into typically cooler seasons. Early season heat waves add to the danger of what\u2019s already the deadliest weather threat because the body can\u2019t gradually acclimatize, or cope better with the heat, Dahl explained. Acclimation or not, the abnormally hot temperatures are also altering the perception of what\u2019s hot. Temperatures through at least midweek will climb up to 10 degrees above normal in parts of the western and southern US, but that pales in comparison to last week\u2019s roasting conditions. Summer should be hot, just not this hot: Parts of the central and eastern US sweltered through temperatures 25 or 30 degrees above normal last week. The heat was so extreme Caribou, Maine, a town just 10 miles from the Canadian border, hit 96 degrees, tying its all-time record high temperature. \u201cThis is not your grandmother\u2019s heat, this is significantly different,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cThis (heat) really isn\u2019t normal and it\u2019s measurably influenced by climate change.\u201d The hottest is yet to come Forecasts for the next few weeks, the next month and the rest of the summer all show one trend clearer than anything else: hotter-than-average temperatures for large sections of the US. Above average temperatures are expected into early July for a vast majority of the Lower 48 with the exception of states along the northernmost tier of the country, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center. July is typically the hottest month of the year, but it is expected to be even hotter than normal this summer in almost every state. Most of the East and parts of the Rockies are likely to be the most anomalously warm areas next month. This prolonged heat could be record-breaking. Last July in Phoenix was the hottest month ever experienced in any US city. The city\u2019s average July temperature \u2013 calculated based on both high and low temperatures for the month \u2013 was an astonishing 102.7 degrees. Heat in Phoenix last summer wasn\u2019t just extreme, it was long-lasting. Its longevity and dangerously high daytime and overnight temperatures took a toll on human health. The scorching July contributed to the deadliest year for heat in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, since officials began keeping records in 2003. Heat lasted well beyond July last summer for much of the US. A series of unrelenting heat domes baked huge parts of the country with the effects of each worsened by the one before. Every heat dome that parked over part of the country roasted the ground, dried out soils and made subsequent temperatures even hotter. This year looks to be no different. Warmer-than-normal conditions are expected to extend through the summer and most of the fall, according to the CPC. Warmer-than-normal falls aren\u2019t nearly as dangerous as hot summers. But the cooler seasons only mask the lingering threat of extreme heat as long as global temperatures continue to rise, which scientists say can only be mitigated by dramatically reducing or phasing out planet-polluting fossil fuel use. \u201cThe more we try to normalize (heat), the greater the danger we have of taking our eye off the ball in terms of what needs to be done to address climate change,\u201d Dahl said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/weather/us-summer-heat-forecast-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-gaza-children-starvation-malnutrition-intl", "text": "Younis lays disorientated on a green mattress in\u00a0Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza. His long brown eyelashes rest delicately on his pale sunken face, as he drifts in and out of sleep. The 9-year-old Palestinian boy lies in his mother\u2019s arms, clearly wasted from severe malnutrition and suffering from dehydration. His blue jogging bottoms hang off his emaciated legs, as his tiny ribcage protrudes from his billowy orange T-shirt. \u201cI call on people with conscience to help me find health care for my son, so that he can go back to normal,\u201d his mother, Ghanima Juma\u2019a, told CNN last week at the hospital in Khan Younis. \u201cI am losing my son in front of my eyes.\u201d Two months ago, the family was forced to flee the southern city of Rafah as Israel ramped up its attacks there. These days, they struggle to survive, living along the polluted coastline of Asda\u2019a \u2014 near the Al-Mawasi tent camp \u2014 where they cannot find enough food, water, or even shade from the Gaza heat. \u201cWe have to keep moving from one area to the other because of the war and the invasion\u2026 Life is difficult,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a tent over our heads.\u201d Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has depleted the territory\u2019s health system, leaving staff unable to treat malnourished children. Doctors told CNN they are being forced to turn away parents begging for baby milk, unable to even triage young patients with chronic illnesses compounded by severe hunger. And as Israel continues its siege on Gaza,\u00a0preventing aid groups getting enough food into the enclave, parents say they have no choice but to watch their children starve to death.\u00a0More than eight months of bombardment has shredded infrastructure, wiped out communities and laid waste to entire neighborhoods. Sanitation systems \u2014\u00a0already stressed by water shortages from extreme heat \u2014\u00a0have been heavily destroyed, according to\u00a0the UN, diminishing access to clean water. A report published Tuesday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition, warned that almost all of Gaza will\u00a0face famine\u00a0within the next three months. The UN\u2019s food agency earlier warned that southern Gaza could soon see the same \u201ccatastrophic levels of hunger\u201d recorded previously\u00a0in the north,\u00a0where Israel concentrated its military offensive in the early days of the war. At least 34 children have already died of malnutrition in Gaza, the government media office reported on June 22. The true number could be higher, as limited access to Gaza has impeded aid agencies\u2019 efforts to fully assess the crisis there. More than 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition, the\u00a0UN\u2019s agency for Palestine refugees\u00a0(UNRWA) said earlier this month. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed\u00a037,658 Palestinians\u00a0and injured another\u00a086,237 people, according to Gaza health officials. Severe water shortages As Younis suffers in his mother\u2019s arms in Gaza\u2019s south, children in the north have been dealing with food shortages even longer. In the Jabalya refugee camp, they queue at a water truck, beads of sweat rolling down their faces, as they weave through the rubble-filled streets. Dozens of other Gazans crowd together to access water as aid workers nearby distribute thick, steaming red soup from large saucepans. It\u2019s rare access to food and clean water. Those in the north told CNN they have resorted lately to drinking polluted water, which does little to help dehydration and spreads infectious diseases. Israel insists there is \u201cno limit\u201d on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but its inspection regime on trucks, restrictions on land routes and increased bombardment means relief is barely trickling in.\u00a0Even when aid enters the besieged territory, the risk of hungry Palestinians scrambling over convoys hampers distribution efforts. UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u00a0recently\u00a0warned the\u00a0absence of police authorities in Gaza during the conflict had led to \u201ctotal lawlessness.\u201d Earlier this year, the UN\u00a0warned that\u00a0Israel is creating an \u201centirely man-made disaster\u201d in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has\u00a0\u00a0denied allegations\u00a0by the International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor that he has used \u201cstarvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\u201d \u201cThe only water we have is what we get as aid. People are suffering as a result, it is indescribable,\u201d said one civilian named Hassan Kalash.\u00a0\u201cWe are ill and don\u2019t have the strength to transport the water\u2026 The water pipe is broken. We do not have water infrastructure.\u201d Civilians there told CNN they have no access to running water, relying on scant aid entering the area. At least 67% of water and sanitation facilities in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or damaged in the eight months of bombardment,\u00a0UNRWA\u00a0said last week. All of five wastewater treatment plants in Gaza have shut down,\u00a0according to the UN Environment Programme. The UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has\u00a0accused Israeli authorities of obstructing humanitarian access to northern Gaza. In the first three weeks of\u00a0June,\u00a036 trucks carrying aid \u2014\u00a0 which were facilitated by Israel \u2014 were allowed to reach Gaza, while another 35 were either denied access,\u00a0impeded\u00a0or canceled due to logistical, operational or security reasons. The impact on the ground is visceral. In Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza, 5-year-old Razan wears a gold ring on her finger, which is covered in red sores. The Palestinian girl is sprawled on a trolley in the central Gaza facility, her grey eyes weary with exhaustion. \u201cShe changed after the war. She became weak,\u201d her aunt, Um Razan Mheitem, told CNN, adding that her niece had developed skin inflammation due to malnutrition. \u201cWe cannot find anything for her. Everything in the market is expensive, or not available.\u201d \u2018Waiting for them to die, one by one\u2019 Newborn babies and pregnant women are among the most at risk of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza, according to aid agencies and health workers. Undernourished mothers are more likely to give birth prematurely, with\u00a0newborns dying because they weigh too little. At the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, doctors were unable to keep baby Amal alive just four days after her birth. CNN filmed the moments before her death, showing Amal drawing heavy breaths in an incubator, after her mother, Samaher, gave birth two months prematurely. Her tiny pink toes are covered in plastic tubes. \u201cThese babies are dying. It is God\u2019s decision, but it is caused by people,\u201d her father, Ahmed Maqat, told CNN, after she died on Saturday. Samaher had endured months of her pregnancy without sleeping, eating or drinking, Maqat said. \u201cEveryone in these beds today is at risk of dying. We are waiting for them to die one by one,\u201d he added, his voice quivering with grief. \u201cWe have no life.\u201d Dr Ahmed Kahlot, head of the incubators department at Kamal Adwan, told CNN that Samaher\u2019s poor health meant her daughter was just \u201cwaiting for death.\u201d Many of those who do survive are too dehydrated and malnourished to breastfeed their children. But health workers told CNN there are few alternatives, with shortages of lactose free or soya milk for infants. Another Palestinian in Kamal Adwan Hospital told CNN that her son, who suffers from an inflamed esophagus, is unable to access soya milk, which he needs in his condition. \u201cHe hardly sits,\u201d she said of her 2-year-old child. \u201cHe cannot even crawl, cannot walk.\u201d Around 250 patients are receiving treatment for malnutrition at the hospital, and there are only two functioning stabilization centers for severely malnourished children in Gaza, OCHA reported\u00a0earlier this month, endangering almost 3,000 children, who were receiving treatment for acute malnutrition in the south prior to the military escalation in Rafah. Doctors say they are often unable to treat babies who show symptoms of malnutrition, including breathing problems, chest infections, and severe dehydration, amid dwindling medical supplies. Malnourished patients with chronic or infectious illnesses are less likely to recover,\u00a0a local pediatrician\u00a0told CNN, as the spread of\u00a0disease spikes\u00a0in displacement shelters. Authorities in Gaza have recorded more than 1.4 million cases of infectious diseases since October 7, according to the Ministry of Health there. As hunger worsens and parts of the enclave hurtle towards widespread famine, aid agencies have repeatedly called for the opening of land crossings into Gaza, which they say are the most effective way of getting relief into the strip. A US-built floating pier designed to bring in aid in by sea has been beset by problems \u2014\u00a0from unfavorable sea conditions to distribution issues once the aid ins transferred on land \u2014\u00a0failing to make a meaningful difference to the crisis.

{"id": "2024_06_27_asia_myanmar-junta-weapons-thailand-banks-intl-hnk", "text": "International banks are playing a significant role in the Myanmar military junta\u2019s ability to carry out its systematic and deadly assault on its people, a new United Nations-backed report has found. Thai banks have now become the\u00a0main source through which the Myanmar military is buying weapons and military supplies \u2013 including parts for helicopter gunships \u2013 used to support its three-year civil war that has devastated the country and killed more than 5,000 civilians, Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Myanmar, said in a new report Wednesday. Since\u00a0seizing power in a coup in February 2021, the military has been fighting a deepening war against ethnic armed groups and people\u2019s resistance forces across Myanmar. In recent months it has faced significant losses of territory and troops. As it contends with widespread public opposition and an economic crisis that has sparked\u00a0soaring levels of poverty,\u00a0the junta has increased airstrikes and attacks against civilians\u00a0and civilian infrastructure, displacing more than 3 million people. Andrews said the junta has increased its deadly aerial attacks against civilian targets by \u201cfivefold\u201d in the past six months, fueling the humanitarian crisis as it seeks to \u201cscare\u201d civilians into ceasing resistance to the military. \u201cThey\u2019re able to do that by procuring weapons from abroad, and that\u2019s made possible by the services they receive from these banks,\u201d Andrews told CNN. The military\u2019s brutal campaign of violence has prompted Western nations to impose wide-ranging sanctions on military leaders, family and cronies, state-owned companies, banks, and jet fuel suppliers. The report, \u201cBanking on the Death Trade: How Banks and Governments Enable the Military Junta in Myanmar,\u201d found that 16 banks in seven countries have processed transactions linked to the military\u2019s procurement in the past year. Weapons, dual-use technologies, manufacturing equipment, and raw materials secured by the junta from abroad reached $253 million between April 2023 and March 2024, the report said. \u201cBy relying on financial institutions that are willing to do business with Myanmar state-owned banks under its control, the junta has ready access to the financial services it needs to carry out systematic human rights violations, including aerial attacks on civilians,\u201d Andrews wrote in the report. However, the volume of weapons and military supplies purchased by the junta through foreign banks has decreased by a third from 2023, with exports from Singapore dropping dramatically, according to the report. \u201cThe good news is that the junta is increasingly isolated,\u201d the report said.\u00a0\u201cThe bad news is that the junta is circumventing sanctions and other measures by exploiting gaps in sanctions regimes, shifting financial institutions, and taking advantage of the failure of Member States to fully coordinate and enforce actions.\u201d International banks, Andrews said, need to know there is a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d that transactions involving Myanmar\u2019s state-owned entities could be used to buy the weapons or weapons-grade materials fueling the junta\u2019s war-chest. \u201cIf you want to be sure that isn\u2019t happening, then don\u2019t conduct business with Myanmar\u2019s state-owned banks,\u201d he said. The Thai connection Singapore-based entities were Myanmar\u2019s third largest source of weapons and military materials. But following a government investigation, the flow of weapons materials to Myanmar from Singapore-registered companies dropped by nearly 90% compared to the previous year. In 2022, Singapore-based banks facilitated more than 70% of the junta\u2019s purchases passing through the banking system. By 2023, that had dropped to under 20%, the report found. Looking for other financial institutions, the junta found neighboring Thailand. Between 2022 and 2023, exports of\u00a0weapons and related materials from Thai-based entities more than doubled, from $60 million to nearly $130 million last year. \u201cMany SAC (junta) purchases previously made from Singapore-based entities, including parts for Mi-17 and Mi-35 helicopters used to conduct airstrikes on civilian targets, are now being sourced from Thailand,\u201d the report said. Siam Commercial Bank is among the Thai banks that have played a \u201ccrucial role\u201d in the shift, the report found. In 2022, the bank\u00a0facilitated just over $5 million in transactions relating to the military; by 2023 that figure ballooned to more than $100 million, according to the report. In a statement, SCB said it provides \u201cinternational transaction services\u201d between Thailand and Myanmar \u201cwith the primary objective of supporting Thai and international businesses in paying for consumer products and services to Myanmar.\u201d SCB\u2019s statement said the bank complies with all relevant anti-money laundering laws, and an internal investigation determined its transactions with Myanmar are not connected to the arms trade. \u201cSCB reaffirms its commitment to adhering to relevant anti-money laundering and related regulations,\u201d the statement added. A spokesperson for Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN, \u201cwe have seen the report and are looking into it.\u201d \u201cMany countries have been named and certainly these are countries where the majority of financial transactions in the region would pass through,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cOur banking and financial institutions follow banking protocols as any major financial hub. So we will have to first establish the facts before considering any further steps.\u201d Andrews told CNN he welcomed the Thai government\u2019s decision to \u201clook into the facts.\u201d \u201cI am hopeful that (the investigation) is going to lead to positive changes in Thailand, much as it did in Singapore,\u201d he said. In his report, Andrews said it was \u201ccritical\u201d that \u201cfinancial institutions take their human rights obligations seriously and not facilitate the junta\u2019s deadly transactions.\u201d In addition, sanctioning the networks supplying jet fuel to the junta and the military\u2019s \u201cgo-to bank\u201d Myanma Economic Bank, \u201ccould play a decisive role in helping to turn the tide in Myanmar and saving untold numbers of lives,\u201d the report said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/asia/myanmar-junta-weapons-thailand-banks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

The two pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, left the Bifengxia base of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan province on Wednesday night, taking a chartered flight to their new home, according to state broadcaster\u00a0CCTV. After a short stopover in Hong Kong, they arrived at the Los Angeles International Airport on Thursday morning, and will soon head to San Diego, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. The rare loan was finalized in February, just months after Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggested sending pandas to the San Diego Zoo as \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d Xin Bao, a female born in July 2020, is a \u201cgentle and well-behaved\u201d panda, while Yun Chuan, a male born in July 2019, is \u201csmart and lively,\u201d CCTV reported. They were given a celebratory farewell at the Chinese base, attended by American and Chinese dignitaries, including performances and a gift exchange, according to a statement from the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. To ensure their health and safety on the journey, their team prepared meals of fresh bamboo, bamboo shoots, fruits, vegetables and a specially-made cornbread known as \u201cwotou,\u201d CCTV reported. Five breeders and veterinary experts from both countries were also on the flight, with the Chinese experts staying on for three months after the pair arrive to help them \u201cadapt to the new living environment,\u201d according to CCTV. The pandas won\u2019t be viewable to the public for several more weeks while they acclimate \u2013 and once veterinary teams confirm they\u2019re ready to meet their excited American fans, the zoo will share their debut date, it said. China loans pandas to more than 20 countries under a program often referred to as \u201cpanda diplomacy.\u201d Its panda loans with Washington stretch back to 1972 \u2013 though the number of loans have decreased in recent years as US-China relations have worsened. The San Diego Zoo, one of the world\u2019s most renowned, was the first American institution to carry out cooperative research on giant pandas with China. Since 1994, it has worked with the Sichuan conservation center to study the species\u2019 behavior, genetics, artificial breeding, nutrition and disease prevention. Fewer than 2,000 giant pandas remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, which lists the species as vulnerable. But the zoo has had no pandas for the past few years \u2013 it returned its last two pandas to China in 2019, after its loan agreement ended. Yun Chuan\u2019s mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at San Diego Zoo in 2007 to parents Bai Yun and Gao Gao, according to a\u00a0press release issued by San Diego Zoo\u00a0in April. Grandmother Bai Yun was born in China in 1991, and arrived at the San Diego Zoo in 1996. She returned to China in 2019 at the age of 27, according to Chinese state media. The\u00a0Smithsonian National Zoo\u00a0in Washington, DC, also sent its three pandas back to China last November \u2013 marking the end of more than 50 years of Chinese pandas being housed at the zoo. The end of its program had left Zoo Atlanta as the only other US zoo to feature pandas. Chinese leader Xi hinted at this newest loan last November, after extensive talks with President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in San Francisco. \u201cWe are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation, and do our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples,\u201d he said at the time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/world/china-pandas-san-diego-zoo-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_asia_philippines-leila-de-lima-acquitted-intl-hnk", "text": "A Philippine court has dropped drugs charges against one of the most vocal critics of former President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s bloody \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d ending a long legal battle that had seen the former senator held for more than six years in police custody. Opposition figure Leila De Lima, who was released on bail last November after\u00a0she was acquitted of two counts, was cleared of a third and final charge on Monday, her lawyer told state broadcaster PTV. The charges stemmed from allegations by Duterte that De Lima had received payoffs from convicted drug gangs to fund her 2016 senatorial bid. More than 6,000 people were killed in\u00a0anti-drug operations\u00a0during Duterte\u2019s tenure as president from 2016 to 2022, according to police data. Many of the extrajudicial killings of suspected drug offenders took place in the poorest areas of the country \u2013 and independent monitors believe the number of those killed could be much higher. Human rights activists had long criticized De Lima\u2019s prosecution and lengthy detention, pointing out that she was held in a police cell despite not having been convicted of any charges. They say her treatment is emblematic of a deteriorating rights situation in a country where political activists and the media often face threats, harassment and even death for attempting to keep those in power in check. On Monday, supporters who gathered outside the courthouse in Muntinlupa city shouted, \u201cLeila is free,\u201d according to a livestreamed video posted on her official Facebook page. Speaking to reporters outside the court, De Lima said\u00a0Duterte would be held responsible for \u201csins committed\u201d against Filipinos. \u201cI\u2019m only one of the victims. Thousands of Filipinos were murdered during the bloody and fake \u2018drug war.\u2019 Many families lost loved ones,\u201d she said. \u201cFor those who weren\u2019t killed, they were left languishing in jail because of the incorrect and twisted enforcement of the law. I\u2019m one of those who have experienced unjust imprisonment.\u201d During his tenure as president, Duterte\u00a0repeatedly said the\u00a0killings\u00a0of\u00a0drug\u00a0suspects are lawful if police are acting in self defense. He had previously admitted to killing drug suspects\u00a0during his time as mayor of Davao City. In July last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC)\u00a0rejected an appeal by the Philippine government to block an investigation by prosecutors into Duterte\u2019s drug war. An ICC judge said the dismissal by the Hague-based court meant the Philippines has exhausted its options to appeal. Duterte\u2019s administration and its successor under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have pushed back against the ICC\u2019s probe, denouncing the investigations as unjust. The Philippines was formerly a signatory to the ICC but Duterte canceled the country\u2019s membership after the court began probing his drug war. But under the ICC\u2019s withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state \u2013 in this case, between 2016 and 2019, when the Philippines\u2019 pullout became official.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/philippines-leila-de-lima-acquitted-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_europe_keir-starmer-labour-profile-uk-election-intl-cmd", "text": "As Britain edges closer\u00a0toward\u00a0its general election on July 4, the polls tell the same story they have for\u00a0most\u00a0of the past three years:\u00a0This is a country screaming out for change. The situation has been dire for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak since he took office\u00a0in late\u00a02022.\u00a0His governing Conservative Party \u2013 whose 14 years in power have been defined by the political gambles of austerity, Brexit and radical economics \u2013\u00a0fell behind the opposition Labour Party in the polls around November 2021, and the gap has only widened since. Barring a major shock, Labour leader Keir Starmer will be the person walking through the famous black door of 10 Downing Street\u00a0in less than three weeks\u2019 time. Starmer has promised to be the agent of change that Britain needs. He has pledged to grow the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0economy by reforming planning laws and investing in a new industrial strategy. He\u00a0has said he\u00a0will set up a national wealth fund with \u00a37.3 billion\u00a0($9.3bn)\u00a0of public money that will help pay for the transition to net zero\u00a0emissions. An\u00a0\u00a38.3bn publicly-owned energy company, Great British Energy, will see the\u00a0United Kingdom\u2019s energy grid\u00a0decarbonized\u00a0by 2030. Starmer says all this can be achieved without raising income taxes, though there are no commitments\u00a0on other levies, such as capital gains tax, which is paid on money made from selling assets, including property and shares. The rest of the\u00a0Labour\u00a0manifesto combines a mix of modest centrism mixed with soft socialism.\u00a0It includes imposing\u00a0taxes on private schools to\u00a0help\u00a0pay for state education and windfall\u00a0levies\u00a0on energy companies to fund the transition to clean energy. There are\u00a0also\u00a0commitments on workers\u2019 rights, cutting waiting lists for health care\u00a0and\u00a0also controlling immigration. Critics on the right say that Starmer will need to raise taxes to fund his plans, while\u00a0skeptics\u00a0on the left say his manifesto is not bold or ambitious enough to change Britain for the better. This is a Britain, of course, that has had\u00a0record-high\u00a0inflation over the past two years, watched interest rates\u00a0skyrocket, seen the pound sink to a record low\u00a0against the dollar,\u00a0is still in a\u00a0cost-of-living\u00a0crisis, has had the longest waiting times for\u00a0medical\u00a0operations in recent history and has spent the past eight years in political turmoil following the\u00a02016\u00a0vote to leave the European Union. In short,\u00a0this is\u00a0a long list of things to sort out in a five-year term when public finances are in disarray. The question for Starmer, should he win, is whether the mess is too big for him to fix and whether he has the political skill to bring about the change he has promised. Who is Keir Starmer? On paper,\u00a0the 61-year-old\u00a0Starmer looks like a classic establishment figure. Once a leading human rights lawyer, he became Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 2008, running the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales \u2013\u00a0a high-profile job for which he was knighted, making him the first ever Labour leader to enter the job with the prefix Sir to their name. Starmer, however, is - by the standards of modern political leaders - from relatively humble beginnings. Born in 1962, Starmer grew up in a small town to the south of London. His father was a toolmaker who worked in a factory, his mother was a nurse who suffered with severe physical disabilities, which ultimately led to one of her legs being amputated. While Starmer has never claimed to have suffered poverty, he has talked of financial struggles that affected his family, as well as the learning difficulties that held back his younger brother. Clearly, these early experiences shaped Starmer\u2019s politics. He has talked about noticing people looking down on his father for working in a factory or bullying his brother. His parents were political, naming their\u00a0eldest after the first Labour leader in parliament, Keir Hardie. \u201cHe\u2019s the first Labour leader in a generation to talk about class and snobbery,\u201d\u00a0Tom Baldwin, author of \u201cKeir Starmer: The Biography,\u201d\u00a0told CNN.\u00a0\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make him a class warrior but someone who understands the different layers of pride, aspiration and guilt\u2026 He feels the sting of the disrespect his dad experienced\u2026 He talks a lot about his sister who has led a precarious life as a carer, having not gone to university,\u201d Baldwin added. Starmer chose to study law at the University of Leeds, before completing a postgraduate\u00a0degree\u00a0at the University of Oxford. He initially thought he would have a legal career working for trade unions, but as his politics evolved in line with his studies, he became increasingly interested in human rights. What does he believe? Starmer has been on something of a journey since entering politics. He was elected to Parliament in 2015 at the age of 52 and\u00a0entered\u00a0the shadow cabinet\u00a0a\u00a0little over a year later. Jeremy Corbyn,\u00a0then the Labour leader, made Starmer his Brexit chief following the 2016 referendum. Corbyn is a controversial figure in British politics and serving in his top team is still something that haunts Starmer. Corbyn had historically been\u00a0on\u00a0the far left of the Labour Party. Prior to becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn had at various points in his long career supported nuclear disarmament,\u00a0and\u00a0withdrawal from NATO, and said it was a \u201ctragedy\u201d that Osama bin Laden was killed rather than put on trial. Starmer was in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet\u00a0for\u00a0the 2017 and 2019 general elections \u2013 something the Conservatives bring up regularly as evidence that he is a threat to national security, having tried twice to make Corbyn prime minister. However, Starmer has since kicked Corbyn out of\u00a0the\u00a0Labour Party following an investigation into\u00a0antisemitism\u00a0during Corbyn\u2019s time as leader. Starmer\u00a0has also said\u00a0that he supported Corbyn knowing he would lose. Pressed on that point in a BBC \u201cQuestion Time\u201d program, he said Corbyn \u201cwould be a better prime minister\u201d than \u201cwhat we got\u201d in Boris Johnson. Starmer also argues\u00a0that he\u00a0has brought Labour back to a position of electability. The polls suggest that is true, but critics of Starmer on the left say that he used Corbyn and\u00a0his wing\u00a0of the Labour Party to win the party leadership in 2020 \u2013 committing to\u00a0several\u00a0left-wing positions\u00a0such as\u00a0nationalizing public services, scrapping university tuition fees and reversing\u00a0Conservative welfare reforms \u2013 only to abandon those pledges\u00a0once he got closer to\u00a0power. James Schneider, Corbyn\u2019s former communications chief, told CNN: \u201cStarmer is not a principled man. His campaign to become Labour leader was systemically dishonest. His cynicism and lack of policies to improve people\u2019s lives will lead to a deep disillusionment that could either feed the hard right or a future people\u2019s movement for change.\u201d Starmer has at various times responded to accusations that he has drifted politically by saying that he puts his country before his political party, and that it\u2019s only possible to change things if you are in power. Can Starmer change Britain? Whether you think Starmer\u2019s\u00a0current\u00a0plan is unambitious, dishonest, or exactly what Britain needs, it\u2019s impossible to push through policy without political and personal capital. Dominic Grieve, a Conservative politician who served as\u00a0attorney\u00a0general while Starmer was DPP, speaks glowingly of this period. \u201cHe ran his department very efficiently and effectively at a really difficult time because his budget had been cut. It was genuinely very impressive,\u201d\u00a0Grieve told CNN. Grieve\u00a0added\u00a0that Starmer was able to be an effective manager because \u201che is not bogged down with years of political ideology or baggage. He can see what is wrong and can address it.\u201d Much as Starmer\u2019s allies might see this as a strength, his opponents, from both sides of politics,\u00a0see it as a weakness. To those on the right, Starmer is a man who will say anything to get in power. He is someone who\u00a0in their eyes\u00a0will support\u00a0Corbyn,\u00a0who is anti-NATO and has repeatedly been accused of being a terrorist\u00a0sympathizer,\u00a0to get what he wants and is a danger to Britain. To the left, he is someone who doesn\u2019t have the conviction\u00a0to make radical changes\u00a0and, once in office,\u00a0will not be materially that different to a Conservative leader. If current polling is accurate, Starmer will\u00a0win\u00a0a historic and enormous majority in the\u00a0House of Commons. But\u00a0the future may not be so simple.\u00a0Given\u00a0the current state of Britain\u2019s finances, the circumstances of\u00a0Labour\u2019s probable\u00a0victory and, even Starmer\u2019s own personality traits, it\u00a0might mean he doesn\u2019t have quite the blank check\u00a0that a leader with virtually no opposition\u00a0in parliament\u00a0would typically enjoy. An\u00a0inability to turn that parliamentary power into tangible results\u00a0at a time when voters are crying out for something different\u00a0could mean that five years from now, his moderate, safety-first center-left program may ultimately be\u00a0seen as\u00a0just as big a political gamble as any of those the Conservatives took in the\u00a0past 14 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/europe/keir-starmer-labour-profile-uk-election-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_gaza-famine-ipc-report-intl-latam", "text": "A high risk of famine persists in Gaza and the situation \u201cremains catastrophic\u201d as the war between Israel and Hamas continues, according to a report\u00a0released Tuesday by\u00a0the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). Nearly half a million are projected to face catastrophic levels of hunger, the most severe level on the IPC scale where people \u201cexperience an extreme lack of food, starvation, and exhaustion of coping capacities,\u201d according to the report. 96% of the population of Gaza \u2013 more than 2 million people \u2013 will face crisis, emergency, or catastrophic levels of food insecurity through at least the end of September, the report projects. \u201cA high risk of famine persists across the whole of the Gaza Strip as long as conflict continues and humanitarian access is restricted,\u201d the\u00a0report said. \u201cOnly the cessation of hostilities in conjunction with sustained humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip can reduce the risk of a famine occurring in the Gaza Strip.\u201d \u201cThe last few months have demonstrated that food and humanitarian access and malnutrition prevalence can change very quickly, the risk of epidemics is increasing and eight months of extreme pressure on the lives of the population make them much more vulnerable to collapse into famine,\u201d said the report, compiled by the IPC\u2019s Famine Review Committee. \u201cGiven the unpredictability of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian access challenges, any significant change may lead to a very rapid deterioration into Famine,\u201d the report said. The findings of the report echo testimonies from those on the ground about the dire humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Nearly nine months of Israel\u2019s bombardment and siege have depleted the health care system, battered water infrastructure and created dire conditions for the entire population of more than 2.2 million people. Increased Israeli attacks in the southern city of Rafah have triggered mass displacement and an outbreak of infectious diseases in the sprawling tent camps where people cannot access basic sanitation. With no signs of\u00a0an imminent ceasefire\u00a0being agreed to stop the fighting, relief workers say the suffering of civilians on the ground will only get worse. \u201cThe latest data shows\u00a0that, to be able to purchase food, more than half of the households had to exchange their clothes for money and one third resorted to picking up trash to sell,\u201d the report detailed in its \u201cspecial snapshot.\u201d \u201cMore than half also reported that, often, they do not have any food to eat in the house, and over 20 percent go entire days and nights without eating.\u201d The report acknowledged there were some improvements to the situation in the north of Gaza, where the IPC warned in March that famine was imminent. Tuesday\u2019s report assessed that due to an increase in food deliveries in March and April, \u201cthe available evidence does not indicate that Famine is currently occurring\u201d in the north. However, it notes the possibility remains throughout the entire Gaza Strip. Although there was also some improvement in the south of Gaza in that time, the report said, the situation deteriorated with the launch of Israel\u2019s military operations in Rafah. The Rafah crossing \u2013 a key transitway for humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2013 has been closed since early May, and only a handful of other land crossings remain open. Humanitarian aid workers continue to face tremendous risks to try to distribute the desperately needed aid to Gaza. The majority of the infrastructure to support humanitarian work in Gaza has been destroyed in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. \u201cThe humanitarian space in the Gaza Strip continues to shrink and the ability to safely deliver assistance to populations is dwindling,\u201d the report\u2019s special snapshot said. \u201cThe recent trajectory is negative and highly unstable. Should this continue, the improvements seen in April could be rapidly reversed.\u201d The report also \u201cencourages all stakeholders who use the IPC for high-level decision-making to understand that whether a Famine classification is confirmed or not does not in any manner change the fact that extreme human suffering is without a doubt currently ongoing in the Gaza Strip.\u201d It \u201cdoes not change the immediate humanitarian imperative to address this civilian suffering by enabling complete, safe, unhindered, and sustained humanitarian access into and throughout the Gaza Strip, including through ceasing hostilities,\u201d the report continued. \u2018Specter of famine continues to hang over Gaza\u2019 The United States, Israel\u2019s closest ally, has repeatedly called on the Netanyahu government to do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. US President Joe Biden warned in early April that Israel had to take immediate concrete steps or risk changes in US policy. Thus far, there have been no such changes in policy. A spokesperson for the US humanitarian agency USAID said in response to the report that \u201cthe scale of food insecurity in Gaza is staggering.\u201d \u201cMore than 2 million people are in need of food assistance And the inability of food to get into the hands of people and the ongoing insecurity is driving that need,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. The spokesperson said that \u201ccivilians and aid workers must be protected; attacks on hospitals, health facilities, ambulances, water services, civilian telecoms services, and IDP shelter locations must stop; and the health, water, and sanitation system must be strengthened in order to avert worse outcomes.\u201d \u201cSince the conflict first began unfolding, USAID has worked relentlessly to increase assistance into Gaza and we will continue to do so,\u201d they said. \u201cThe IPC report \u2026 obviously it confirmed what we all know and what we\u2019ve been dealing with for some time is that the humanitarian situation on the ground is extremely dire. That\u2019s why we have been so incredibly focused on alleviating that situation,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for a ceasefire, obviously, even as we try to get one and we need to do more to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do \u2026 through working to resolve these issues between the government of Israel, the Israeli security forces and the UN humanitarian agencies.\u201d Meanwhile, humanitarian workers are warning that the situation in Gaza is untenable. \u201cIn the north, when we raised the famine alarm, we were able to get some more trucks in. And so for the moment, it is better. Not great \u2014 I don\u2019t want to give false illusions here that this is all hunky dory, because it\u2019s not,\u201d said World Food Programme Director Cindy McCain. \u201cThere\u2019s still great need in the north, and it\u2019s complex. It\u2019s complex for this reason. It\u2019s not just food they need. They need water, they need sanitation, they need health care. All of those things contribute to famine.\u201d A humanitarian official told CNN, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to very rapidly be back on the sort of trajectory that we were seeing in north. The scale will be much larger because it was 300,000 people give or take in northern Gaza. It\u2019s one and a half to 1.8 million people now in the southern middle areas who are in similar boat.\u201d Kate Phillips-Barrasso, of Mercy Corps, added, \u201cThe population cannot endure these hardships any longer. The toll of military action has been far too high, and we fear without dramatic changes to the provision of humanitarian aid, the death toll will climb as people succumb to months of deprivation. \u201cThe humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly, and the specter of famine continues to hang over Gaza,\u201d Phillips-Barrasso told CNN. \u201cDespite some aid getting in, the glaring contradictions remain. Commercial trucks are allowed passage, yet humanitarian aid is limited, scrutinized at the border, and, when permitted to cross, typically only reaches some city centers without proper security.\u201d \u201cCompounding the suffering is oppressive summer heat, no access to clean water, and increasing exposure to garbage and sewage. This lethal equation will undoubtedly lead to acute suffering and mortality,\u201d she said. On Friday, the commissioner-general for the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinia refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, urged the \u201cuninterrupted, regular, coordinated and meaningful flow of humanitarian assistance.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_26_americas_bolivia-coup-attempt-claims-intl-latam", "text": "A Bolivian general has been arrested and accused of mounting a coup against the government after attempting to storm the presidential palace on Wednesday. Military units led by Gen. Juan Jose Z\u00fa\u00f1iga \u2013 dismissed as commander of the Bolivian army just a day earlier \u2013 occupied the main square in the capital, La Paz, as armored vehicles rammed the palace door and soldiers tried to break into government offices. Hours later, President Luis Arce \u2013 who had called on the public to \u201corganize and mobilize\u201d in defense of democracy \u2013 could be seen confronting Z\u00fa\u00f1iga in the crowded palace hallway, ordering the general to withdraw his soldiers and stand down. After Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was handcuffed and forced into a police car, a triumphant Arce raised his clenched fist to the huge crowds that had flocked to the presidential palace, signaling the defeat of the attempted coup. His defense minister Edmundo Novillo later told a news conference the government had regained \u201ctotal and absolute control\u201d over its military. \u201cWe urge the population that everything goes back to normal,\u201d he said. Bolivia has a long history of political instability - there have been almost 40 attempted or successful coups since 1946. The failed takeover comes as the landlocked South American country of some 12 million people struggles with a spiraling economic crisis that has sparked street protests in recent months. The country has been wracked by dwindling foreign currency reserves, particularly the US dollar, and shortages of fuel and other basic necessities. As he was being arrested Z\u00fa\u00f1iga alleged \u2013 without providing evidence \u2013 that he was acting on Arce\u2019s instructions. \u201cOn Sunday I met with the president and the president told me, \u2018The situation was very f*****, that this week would be critical. And so, it\u2019s necessary to prepare something to bring up my popularity.\u2019 And so he told me, he asked me, \u2018Shall we take out the armored (vehicles)?\u2019\u201d Z\u00fa\u00f1iga told reporters. Justice Minister Ivan Lima denied Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s claims, saying he \u201clies and tries to justify himself about a decision he took and over which he will have to answer to justice.\u201d The attempted coup was widely condemned by the Bolivian government and international leaders. Bolivia\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office said it has launched a criminal investigation against Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and \u201call the other participants\u201d involved in the incident. It is unclear where Z\u00fa\u00f1iga is being held. \u2018The people have no future\u2019 Earlier Wednesday, footage from the scene showed armed soldiers occupying Murillo Plaza, a main square in La Paz where the national executive and legislative offices are located. Armored vehicles were seen ramming into the doors of Bolivia\u2019s government palace, according to the Associated Press, as former president Morales, who is a member of Arce\u2019s Movement to Socialism (MAS) party, said on X that a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat is brewing.\u201d Video also showed some civilians facing off with soldiers in Murillo Plaza during the coup attempt. Bolivia\u2019s latest political showdown comes as tensions rise over plans by leftist former president Evo Morales to run for reelection against one-time ally Arce in general elections next year. Prior to his detention, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga addressed reporters in the square, flanked by soldiers, saying, \u201cWe want to restore democracy,\u201d as he spoke of the country\u2019s economic woes. He had earlier been dismissed reportedly for threatening to block a bid by Morales for reelection. \u201cThe people have no future, and the army has the courage to look out for the future of our children, the well-being and progress of our people,\u201d he said. He vowed \u201cto free all political prisoners\u201d including former president Jeanine Anez,\u00a0currently imprisoned for what the courts said was her role in deadly protests that erupted after her ascension to power in 2019. Amid the chaos, President Arce announced new military commanders, including Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s replacement as army chief, Gen. Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez. The situation appeared to have been defused when S\u00e1nchez ordered the soldiers in the square\u00a0to return to their units. Armed vehicles were seen leaving Murillo Plaza soon after, according to footage from Bolivia TV. Arce also announced new heads of the navy and the air force. CNN is trying to contact Bolivia\u2019s government for comment. Morales, who publicly split from his former ally Arce, resigned as president in 2019 following mounting protests over accusations of election fraud; at the time, he claimed he was forced out in a coup. Gustavo A. Flores-Mac\u00edas, professor of government and public policy at Cornell University, told CNN the attempted coup reflects widespread discontentment in the country. \u201cWhat is happening in Bolivia is that broad sectors of society, across social strata, across all levels, are very unhappy with the way things are, especially on the economic front. And, we have an election coming in 2025,\u201d he said. In that election, Arce and Morales \u201cseemed to be in this collision course. Both of them angling to become the next president,\u201d he added. International condemnation Fredy Mamani, former deputy foreign minister of Bolivia and an ally of Morales and Arce, told CNN that despite the \u201cundemocratic\u201d nature of \u201cthe tanks, the uniformed soldiers and taking the square\u2026 it is essential to highlight that the Bolivian people are united in the face of any coup d\u2019etat.\u201d But echoing Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s comments, an opposition MP accused the government of staging the coup in a bid to rally support. \u201cWhat happened today in Bolivia is a really bizarre situation,\u201d Andrea Barrientos, a Senator for the opposition Civic Community party, told the BBC. \u201cWe can confirm that this was a self-coup, organized by Luis Arce\u2019s government.\u201d News of the attempted coup was roundly condemned by international and regional leaders, including Paraguay\u2019s President Santiago Pe\u00f1a, Mexico\u2019s president, and the European Union. \u201cWe express our support for democracy in our brother country and to the legitimate government of Luis Arce,\u201d Chile\u2019s President Gabriel Boric said on X. The US Embassy in La Plaz said it was \u201cclosely monitoring the situation.\u201d The secretary general of the pan-American Organization\u00a0of\u00a0American\u00a0States (OAS), Luis Almagro, condemned the mobilizations in the \u201cmost energetic way,\u201d on X, saying the \u201carmy must submit to the legitimately elected civil power.\u201d Bolivia has struggled with both persistent political crises and ongoing interference from the army, Carlos Solar, Senior Research Fellow at RUSI, told CNN. This added to a \u201chigh degree of polarization by politicians who have not been able to carry out electoral successions\u201d have undermined Bolivia\u2019s democratic governance.

{"id": "2024_06_27_europe_france-parliament-election-explainer-intl-cmd", "text": "France\u2019s snap parliamentary election is one of the most momentous in decades, for both the country and the rest of Europe. Within two weeks, France could have a hard-left or hard-right government \u2013 or descend into political deadlock if no bloc wins a majority, leaving Paris hamstrung as problems mount at home and abroad. The election will take place over two rounds on June 30 and July 7. How will it work, who are the key players and what is at stake? How did we get here? Minutes after it was announced that his Renaissance party had been trounced in the European Parliament elections, President Emmanuel Macron called a snap national election \u2013 becoming the first president to do so since 1997. Renaissance had come a distant second, with less than half the votes won by the far-right National Rally (RN), the party of Marine Le Pen \u2013 and only marginally ahead of the left-wing coalition in third. Macron is not afraid of bold decisions. The first time he ran for elected office, under a party he had created only the year before, he became president. But even by his standards, this is a huge risk. \u201cIf his bet pays off, he\u2019ll go down as a brilliant strategist,\u201d Kevin Arceneaux, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris, told CNN. \u201cIf not, I think he will go down in history as somebody who essentially exploded the traditional party system in France, and\u2026 took a grenade to the institutions of the Fifth Republic.\u201d Why did Macron call an election? Macron\u2019s decision took even his closest allies by surprise. France\u2019s next elections were not scheduled until 2027. Politicians rarely call an election when their party trails in the polls and there is no need to do so. Analysts have parsed his potential motives. Although Macron was elected to a second presidential term in 2022, his party failed to win an outright parliamentary majority. To pass controversial bills like his pension reform, Macron has increasingly had to bypass parliament and resort to presidential decree, to the outrage of opposition parties and much of the public. One theory about why Macron called an election now is that France might soon have been forced to the polls anyway. Every time Macron passes a law by presidential decree, under Article 49.3 of the French constitution, the parliament can hold a vote of confidence in his government. With more spending bills slated for later this year, Macron\u2019s government may not have survived another of these. Perhaps he judged it is better to jump than be pushed. Another theory is that Macron is gambling that he can defeat extremist parties by exposing them to government. With Le Pen seeming increasingly likely to succeed him as president in 2027 \u2013 when Macron will be unable to stand for a third term \u2013 this election may force her party to take up responsibility beforehand. Out of office, both the hard left and hard right have been able to rail against his policies and make outlandish promises of their own. Once in office, they will run into constraints and may find themselves unable to deliver on their promises \u2013 or simply risk being proved incompetent. Relinquishing some power now may give Macron\u2019s platform a better chance of retaining it in 2027. How does the election work? France\u2019s National Assembly has 577 seats, one for each of its electoral districts. For an absolute majority a party needs 289. In the outgoing government, Macron\u2019s alliance had only 250 seats, and so needed support from other parties to pass laws. If a candidate wins a majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. But most elections go to a second round the following Sunday. Only those who won more than 12.5% of the votes of registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round, meaning it is often fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. At this stage, some candidates may drop out to give allies a better chance of victory. What are the roles of the parliament and president? The National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws \u2013 from pensions and taxation to immigration and education \u2013 while the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party, things run well. When they don\u2019t, the government can grind to a halt. With Macron\u2019s party trailing in the polls and three years left on his presidential term, he may have to appoint a prime minister from an opposition party \u2013 in an arrangement known as \u201ccohabitation.\u201d Nonetheless, Macron has pledged to see out the remainder of his presidential term. Other government ministers are appointed by the president on the prime minister\u2019s advice. While Macron would in theory be free to nominate whomever he pleases, in practice he would be compelled to nominate ministers that reflect the will of the majority of the National Assembly. Who are the key players? In January, Gabriel Attal \u2013 Macron\u2019s protege \u2013 became the youngest prime minister in French history, at the age of 34. Just seven months later, his record could be broken by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader of the RN. Bardella was handpicked by Le Pen to head the party in 2022, ending a 50-year-rule by the Le Pen family and continuing to detoxify the party from its antisemitic and jackbooted past. Bardella grew up as an only child in social housing in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb in Paris. He joined the RN when he was 16 and briefly attended the prestigious Sorbonne university, before dropping out to climb the party ranks. If appointed, he will become Europe\u2019s youngest prime minister in more than two centuries. Bardella\u2019s campaign was bolstered after Eric Ciotti, leader of the mainstream conservative party, the Republicans, said they would enter coalition with the RN. His announcement drew fury from his blindsided party, which has attempted to oust him \u2013 so far unsuccessfully. Ciotti\u2019s endorsement may represent the death knell of France\u2019s \u201ccordon sanitaire\u201d \u2013 the principle by which mainstream parties refuse to cooperate with the radical extremes. On the left, four days after Macron called the election, a cluster of parties banded together to form the New Popular Front \u2013 a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked fascists from gaining power in 1936. The capacious \u2013 and potentially fractious \u2013 alliance comprises three-time presidential candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the France Unbowed party; the Socialists; the Communists; the Ecologists; and Place Publique, headed by the popular member of the European Parliament (MEP) Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann. It is not clear who the bloc would nominate as prime minister, nor how lasting the coalition might prove to be. But it could deliver a blow to Macron\u2019s Renaissance. Rather than several left-wing candidates appearing on the ballot, fragmenting the left-wing vote, there will now only be one in most constituencies, making it easier for the candidate to progress to the second round. What problems might an incoming government face? Since Macron called the election, the financial markets have taken fright \u2013 first at the prospect of an extremist government, then at the economic policies of the left and right. Earlier this month, the risk premium investors demand to hold French government debt reached its highest since 2022. France is running one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone and now risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules, which had been suspended to help countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. French government spending could soon be brutally constrained by Brussels, despite the lavish promises of the RN and New Popular Front. \u201cThe debate on the left and the right is not about fiscal consolidation, it\u2019s about the degree of fiscal expansion they want to implement,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at political risk consultancy the Eurasia Group, told CNN. \u201cNo one is talking about austerity.\u201d Although Bardella has recently tempered some of the RN\u2019s spending plans, Rahman warned there could be a \u201cmajor confrontation\u201d between Brussels and an incoming French government. While these spending constraints might prevent an incoming far-right government from making good on its electoral promises, this may harm rather than help Macron. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that if there\u2019s chaos, it necessarily arrests the momentum of the far right. It may also hurt Macron. The electorate may conclude that ultimately the far right wasn\u2019t able to implement their program because Macron was a constraint \u2013 and that the way to get over the chaos is to ultimately give the far right a majority in 2027,\u201d said Rahman. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s going to end up with blood on their hands \u2013 not just the far right, but probably Macron as well.\u201d What might the outcome be? The two-round voting system makes predictions difficult. If the RN reaches the second round in lots of constituencies, people may vote tactically to keep the party out. But their lead in the polls suggests they are on track to improve significantly on the 88 seats they had in the outgoing parliament \u2013 even if they fall short of an absolute majority. The most likely scenario is a hung parliament, with a relative majority for the RN. But Bardella has said his party will only form a government if it wins an absolute majority. Macron might then have to search for a prime minister on the hard left, or somewhere else entirely. France might have to opt for a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d government \u2013 but these tend to fan the flames of populism rather than extinguish them. Whatever the composition of the next Assembly, France\u2019s next three years are likely to be marked by instability, as parties try to keep their hands clean ahead of the key presidential - and potentially parliamentary - elections in 2027. \u201cOne possibility is that in anticipation of those elections, all the parties in the parliament will see reasons to block each other,\u201d said Arceneaux. \u201cIf we arrive in that situation, we\u2019re just going to have a paralyzed government that\u2019s unable to do anything.\u201d This will likely raise constitutional questions, as domestic and foreign policy questions clash. Bardella has ruled out sending troops to Ukraine \u2013 an idea floated by Macron \u2013 and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. In that situation, whose will would prevail \u2013 Bardella\u2019s or Macron\u2019s? \u201cThis is a perfect example of what we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Arceneaux. \u201cMacron could say, \u2018As President of France, foreign affairs are my responsibility\u2026 so I\u2019m not going to enforce that.\u2019 But then you have a problem, right? You have a constitutional crisis.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/europe/france-parliament-election-explainer-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a post on Telegram that Ukraine carried out the attack using \u201cUS-supplied ATACMS operational-tactical missiles equipped with cluster warheads.\u201d Four missiles were shot down by Russian air defense but another \u201cdeviated from its flight trajectory in the final section due to the impact of air defenses, with the warhead exploding in the air over the city,\u201d the post added. Video footage posted on X shows the aftermath of the strike, with\u00a0wounded civilians seen being carried from the beach in stretchers before being loaded into vehicles. Beachgoers, some of them still in their swimwear, can be seen evacuating the area. One of victims killed in the Ukrainian strike was the daughter of Oleg Averyanov, Deputy Mayor of Magadan. Yuri Grishan, the Mayor of Magadan, said Averyanov\u2019s daughter Sofia was nine and on vacation with her parents in Sevastopol. The casualties were partially caused by the timing of the strike, which came \u201cat a time when civilians, some were returning from work, some had already gone to the beach with their children,\u201d according to Governor Razvozhayev, who has announced a day of mourning. According to eyewitnesses on the ground, there was no air raid siren which warned of the attack. Many local residents also took to the comment section of official posts to express their dissatisfaction about the air raid siren not alerting them to an incoming attack. In response to Ukraine\u2019s attack on Sevastopol, the Russian Ministry of Defense said \u201csuch actions will not go unanswered,\u201d saying responsibility for the attack lied with Washington. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry\u00a0Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin is in constant contact with Sevastopol authorities, adding that the Russian government\u2019s priority is to provide all necessary assistance to victims, RIA says. Ukraine has not officially commented on the attack, but CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for a comment. Crimea has been occupied by Russia since its forces annexed the peninsula in 2014. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, it has come under sporadic attack from Ukrainian forces. Kyiv has previously insisted that its strikes on Crimea, which have targeted Russian naval bases and vessels, are an integral part of their\u00a0strategy, intended to try to isolate the peninsula and make it more difficult for Russia to sustain its military operations on the Ukrainian mainland, a Ukrainian source familiar with the strategy told CNN last year. Before Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sevastopol \u2013 the largest city in Crimea \u2013 was a popular tourist destination for Russians. Even after the outbreak of war, Russians have continued to flock to the coastal city despite the dangers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/europe/at-leastfivedead-and-over-100-injured-in-ukrainian-strike-in-russian-occupied-crimea/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_americas_migration-us-mexico-border-tohono-oodham-intl-latam", "text": "The thermometer hit 111 Fahrenheit\u00a0as we rolled up to a battered tent deep in the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation reservation in Arizona.\u00a0Under its shade lay around a dozen dazed looking families, many with small children.\u00a0A stressed-looking mother of two paced back and forth. They had walked for five hours to get here, and had been waiting all day. But they looked at us \u2013 and the\u00a0tribal dignitaries\u00a0on whose land they were trespassing \u2013 with only mild curiosity.\u00a0They were asylum seekers, looking for the green uniforms of US Border Patrol so that they could turn themselves in. Chairman Verlon Jose, leader of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, considered addressing them, and then turned away. \u201cThis is nothing that the nation can solve,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever I say to them is not even going to be relevant, other than our prayers for their journey.\u201d The Tohono O\u2019odham, or \u201cpeople of the desert,\u201d have lived in the Sonoran desert for thousands of years, their\u00a0ancestral\u00a0homelands stretching from what is now Pima County, Arizona, all the way to Mexico\u2019s Sea of Cortez. The\u00a0US-Mexico border now slices across those lands, a 62-mile line of low metal fencing weaves between ancient saguaro cacti and\u00a0that\u00a0marks the southern limit of the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0federal Indian reservation\u00a0\u2013 and the edge of the United States. The Tohono O\u2019odham do not recognize this border; enrolled members speak their own language, live on both sides and travel back and forth. But it has become impossible to ignore amid\u00a0record numbers of migrants crossing into the US from Mexico\u00a0and a bitter political storm over what to do with them. You could drive for miles on the sprawling Tohono O\u2019odham reservation without encountering anyone beside the free-ranging cattle. But for decades, migrants and asylum seekers, northbound drug smugglers and southbound arms traffickers, and US Border Patrol agents have roamed here in endless pursuit across the rocky terrain. The toll of all this traffic on the environment is obvious; discarded clothes, trash, diapers and even ID cards line the border. In December, during the peak of recent border crossings, thousands of asylum seekers camped out on\u00a0the Nation\u2019s territory, burning the reservation\u2019s wild mesquite trees for warmth as they waited to be apprehended. The sight of the broken branches, piles of abandoned plastic bottles and human waste left in the migrants\u2019 wake was heartbreaking to the tribe, Jose told CNN. \u201cYour heart feels for the migrants and so forth like that\u2026 but then other part says look at the destruction that they\u2019re causing us\u2026 look at the trash that they\u2019re leaving,\u201d Jose told CNN. The chairman and Arizona governor Katie Hobbs\u00a0wrote in a joint letter to the federal government last year requesting ramped up staffing and resources from the US Customs and Border\u00a0Protection (CBP)\u00a0to deal with the surge. But the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0longstanding reliance on the federal government to enforce the border means an uneasy trade of tribal sovereignty for security. Border\u00a0police have had violent run-ins with members, and the thought of a potential border wall is seen as a travesty here \u2013 a mutilation of the land itself. \u201cAll we want is safe passage to our traditional homes, to our sacred areas. The drug activity, the migrant activity is going to go on and go on. And we\u2019re caught in the middle of this,\u201d Jose said. Strangers in the desert The Tohono O\u2019odham reservation\u00a0is part of Arizona\u2019s Tucson sector and\u00a0one of the busiest immigration sectors in the country in both apprehensions of border crossers and marijuana seizures, according to the Customs and Border\u00a0Protection\u00a0website. Across the sprawling reservation, the tribe works closely with CBP, providing land for checkpoints, forward operating bases, surveillance infrastructure, and putting forward indigenous-led special units that investigate and track drug smuggling. The\u00a0Nation says that it spends an average of $3 million annually to assist with border security. Still, strangers walk onto the reservation all the time. In the small southern community of\u00a0Menagers\u00a0Dam, just a 15 minute walk from the border, people turn up asking for water or a phone, others march straight into homes to raid their kitchens, said Annette Mattia, 61, who lives in the village. Some\u00a0Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0members put out water or food for the migrants, others are afraid to. Some members have been involved in smuggling themselves, she says. \u201cWe\u2019re always calling (Border Patrol) because where we live is a bushy area with the trees still there and everything. And that was like the gateway for smugglers. You can just go walk in our yard and in the little trees, and you\u2019ll find the slipper shoes the smugglers use, or their camouflage clothes,\u201d she says. Still, seeing Border Patrol\u2019s trucks and helicopters on the reservation and frequent questioning by agents also makes many\u00a0of the Nation\u2019s residents\u00a0bristle. \u201cIf you decide to go out into the mountains for the day, if you want to pick the cactus fruit or get materials from the desert, Border Patrol will be out there, and they will be on you: \u2018What are you doing here, why are you out here?\u2019,\u201d Annette Mattia told CNN. \u201cYou know, this is our reservation. It\u2019s our nation. We can go hunting if we want to go hunting, we can gather if we want to gather,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re here because the border\u2019s here.\u201d A deadly landscape Sprawling across 2.8\u00a0million acres, it\u2019s easy to imagine getting lost in this desert reservation. Massive rock formations are the only landmarks, rising between low plains dotted with dry shrubs and cactus forests. Many migrants who cross here never make it out alive; the remains of at least 1,650 people have been found across the Tohono O\u2019odham reservation since 2000, according to local organization Humane Borders, which\u00a0works with the Pima County Medical Examiner\u2019s office to track deaths. Last year, the bodies of 81 people were found on the reservation, according to Humane Borders. So far in 2024, 10 bodies have been found here, according to the Humane Borders map, all discovered on the San Miguel corridor \u2013 the same route where we met dozens of people waiting with children as young as toddlers. Most, but not all, are reduced to skeletons in the arid desert. In May, one unidentified man found close to the border was found \u201cfully fleshed\u201d \u2013 he had\u00a0died from heat exposure within a day of being found, according to the county medical examiner\u2019s report. In February, the body of a 22-year-old woman was found on the Baboquivari Peak\u00a0mountain range; she was the victim of blunt force injuries, the medical examiner assessed. Summer is the deadliest time for border crossings. But while migration through the Sonoran Desert has historically slowed during these searing months, that\u2019s no longer the case today, a CBP spokesperson told CNN; human traffickers who\u2019ve made a business of promising asylum in America now push migrants through the border year-round in order to maximize profits. Demand for traffickers is high, despite the risks \u2013 which migrants may not always understand. Since the pandemic, people fleeing stuttering economies, climate change, crime and authoritarian governments have flocked to the US southern border, a CBP spokesperson told CNN \u2013 nearly all those journeys were facilitated by criminal groups. \u201cNo one crosses on their own anymore,\u201d the spokesperson told CNN. Cartels\u2019 grip on the border area is near-complete, he confirmed; attempting to cross the Mexican side of the desert into the US without paying is another way to end up dead. Migrants sent one way, drugs another Today, faced with vast numbers of asylum seekers in a blistering landscape, the day-to-day work of Border Patrol often ends up being humanitarian. In the Tucson Sector, Border Patrol agents perform dozens of rescues each week, according to statistics posted online by the agency, and frequently end up treating dehydrated or injured migrants in the desert. Even more often, agents simply ferry families from the desolate border where asylum seekers politely wait to be apprehended, to detention centers further inland \u2013 a task that one agent likened with annoyance to babysitting or Uber driving. Some describe with nostalgia a Wild West version of their jobs from decades past, chasing drug runners across a dramatic landscape. \u201cBack in the day when it was just single males with a lot of narcotics, it was dangerous but kind of exciting,\u201d said the agent, who requested anonymity because he did not have permission to speak publicly. \u201cSecure the border. We didn\u2019t have to babysit. We were up in the mountains getting narcotics and stuff, chasing gun traffickers, drugs. But now it\u2019s moms and infants. It sucks. Nobody wants to deal with a mama and baby.\u201d Border Patrol agents and Nation\u00a0members say migrants, on whom so much national attention is focused, are often used as a distraction for law enforcement on the reservation. Cartels funnel large groups toward remote areas that are difficult and time-consuming to reach, in addition to being more dangerous for the travelers, while smugglers trek with drug-loaded backpacks\u00a0up another route. \u201cThe cartels want migrants to cross in rural areas to pull us away, so drugs and stuff can make it through while we\u2019re busy\u2026 You\u2019ve got to drive the freaking 30 or 40 minutes out there, pick them up, drive 30 or 40 minutes back. You ain\u2019t got time to go chase three or four people with backpacks walking through the desert,\u201d the agent told CNN. Urban crossing areas are also often more closely patrolled than the desert wilds and are more likely to be blocked by a towering steel barrier, unlike these lands. Mike Wilson, a Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0member who has gained celebrity in human rights circles for years spent putting out water for migrants on the reservation, says many of the deaths on the reservation were predictable. In a recently published memoir, \u201cWhat Side Are You On?\u201d Wilson blames a US border policy of deterrence \u2013 blocking irregular migration at urban crossing points \u2013 for driving asylum seekers into Tohono O\u2019odham lands and the most perilous parts of the desert. The strategy, which originated in the 1990s, included a calculation that deaths resulting from the dangerous trek would deter future migrants. The number of illegal border crossings has risen since then. Security vs. sovereignty Frustrations over the border here came to a head last year, when Annette\u2019s brother Raymond Mattia was shot and killed by a group of Border Patrol agents at his home. Nothing to do with immigration \u2013 they\u00a0were supposed to be backing up a local Tohono O\u2019odham police unit\u00a0that was looking into a 911 call reporting two gunshots had been heard. Footage from\u00a0the agents\u2019 body cameras\u00a0showed their flashlights casting through the dark of the Arizona desert, choppily illuminating saguaro cacti and low shrubs in the neighborhood in search of movement in the area, before noticing the unarmed 58-year-old \u00a0standing in his front yard. Obeying agents\u2019 orders, he removed his hand from his pocket, withdrawing a cell phone. They began firing immediately. \u201cI thought they were yelling and shouting at illegals,\u201d she recalled, describing their attitude as a \u201chyped up and ready to hunt.\u201d \u201cThey had flashlights going like crazy, shouting, yelling at each other, and I was like, \u2018What the heck is going on?\u2019 Then I realized they were going to Ray\u2019s house.\u201d It is unclear if Raymond Mattia was the person they were looking for; authorities made no allegations following the incident. The US Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona has chosen not to press charges over the killing, prompting the Mattia family to launch a wrongful death lawsuit. But holding border agents to account has been\u00a0increasingly hard to do following\u00a0a 2022 Supreme Court ruling\u00a0that gave federal agents broad legal protection against claims of excessive force. \u201cI know they\u2019re here to protect the border: for the terrorists, the immigrants, the smugglers. But when they\u2019re coming to the reservation to shoot a Native American person who is at home, they should be accountable for that kind of action,\u201d Annette Mattia said. In a statement last year criticizing the US Attorney\u2019s decision not to prosecute, Jose linked Mattia\u2019s death to a larger failing of border management. \u201cThe US government\u2019s refusal to enact sensible border solutions has brought undue hardship to O\u2019odham and other border communities,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile politicians waste time debating walls and other ineffective and divisive ideas, our people are persecuted\u00a0and in this case, killed by federal agents.\u201d The chairman sees the federal approach toward the border as all too focused on maintaining an imaginary line and scoring political points, and expressed frustration\u00a0with the failure of Congress to find a bigger-picture, bipartisan solution\u00a0\u2013 something that in recent weeks has led the Biden administration to rely on executive orders instead. \u201cWhy would we want to protect a border? We want to protect the environment. We want to protect the people. We want to protect the communities around here,\u201d\u00a0Jose said. That\u2019s his mandate from Nation\u00a0elders, he said. What the US should do, he said, is focus on \u201ckicking its drug habit\u201d to shrink demand for smuggled narcotics, and widen sustainable immigration pathways for economic migrants that allow them to come, work and eventually leave. Still, as long as migrants keep coming here, so will Border Patrol \u2013 and the tribal government has been clear that it wants the federal agency to handle the immediate crisis. New buildings designed to serve as sleeping and living quarters for Border Patrol agents are currently being built on the reservation. Standing on the border halfway up a mountain, where the low posts that mark the border stop, and the rocks and dry shrubs flow seamlessly between the US and Mexico, Jose was clear on his own red line: While much is out of the Nation\u2019s\u00a0hands, he will resist any kind of border wall \u2013 a prospect that has haunted the nation since the Trump administration, and which looms again with the former President\u2019s reelection bid. From his view, the very first migrant surge started at Plymouth Rock. \u201cIf ever there was a time to build a wall,\u201d he said, \u201cit would have been 500 years ago.\u201d Edited by CNN\u2019s Rachel Clarke in Atlanta.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/americas/migration-us-mexico-border-tohono-oodham-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_europe_evan-gershkovich-trial-begin-russia-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, went on trial Wednesday, appearing in a Russian courtroom\u2019s glass cage with his head recently shaved. Later Wednesday, Gershkovich\u2019s family said the past 15 months had been \u201cextraordinarily painful.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re deeply disappointed that he will have to endure further attempts to discredit him and to paint a picture that is unrecognizable to anyone who knows him. Evan is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime,\u201d his family said in a statement. Gershkovich, 32, was arrested while reporting for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which he joined in January 2022, just weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While many newsrooms subsequently pulled their reporters out of Russia, Gershkovich remained, covering the war and how it was changing life in the country. He was arrested while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and later accused of spying for the CIA. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release. The press was briefly allowed into the courtroom 15 minutes before Wednesday\u2019s hearing began at 11 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET). During earlier appeals against his pre-trial detention, Gershkovich has made love-heart signs and given a thumbs-up to his friends, family and supporters. On Wednesday, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, seeming healthy and composed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters. No reporters will be allowed into the courtroom during the trial itself, which is expected to last months. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. After Wednesday\u2019s hearing wrapped early afternoon, court officials said the trial would resume on August 13, state news agency TASS reported. The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington. In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that \u201cunder instructions from the CIA\u201d and \u201cusing painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d Gershkovich \u201cwas collecting secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. Russian authorities have not publicly offered any evidence for their claims. WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said it was \u201cjarring to see him in yet another courtroom for a sham trial held in secret and based on fabricated accusations.\u201d \u201cWhile we are told he\u2019s doing well given the circumstances, Evan\u2019s wrongful detention continues to be a devastating assault on his freedom and his work and an unfathomable attack on the free press. It\u2019s outrageous that he has already endured 455 days in prison when he never should\u2019ve been arrested,\u201d she said in a statement. Pjotr Sauer, Russian affairs reporter for Britain\u2019s The Guardian newspaper and friend of Gershkovich, told CNN, \u201cEvan is just an honest journalist,\u201d and emphasized that Russian authorities have not presented any evidence against him. \u201cWe\u2019re not holding our breath, it could take weeks or months. And we don\u2019t have much trust in the Russian justice system,\u201d said Sauer, who exchanged letters with Gershkovich before the American reporter was transferred to Yekaterinburg. \u201cRealistically, we believe that Russia will convict him because they\u00a0arrested him in the end because he\u2019s a bargaining chip for Moscow, for Putin to be exchanged.\u201d Ahead of the trial, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US \u201ccertainly\u201d does not expect Gershkovich to have \u201ca free and fair trial given that these are charges that never should have been brought in the first place.\u201d Miller said embassy personnel were traveling to Yekaterinburg, more than 800 miles from Moscow, and would attempt to attend the trial. Before being transferred to Yekaterinburg, Gershkovich was held in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell as his pre-trial detention period was extended several times. He has passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents, Ella Milman and Mikhail Gershkovich, said in a recent interview with the WSJ. \u201cHe\u2019s managing the best way he can, in a tiny space, one hour walking outside \u2013 six steps, six steps, six steps,\u201d Milman said, drawing a small courtyard with her finger. \u201cHe\u2019s been exercising, meditating, reading a lot, answering letters. His knowledge of the Russian language and the culture helped him adjust to the situation.\u201d Political \u2018pawns\u2019 In his State of the Union address in March \u2013 with Gershkovich\u2019s parents in the audience \u2013 US President Joe Biden said his administration was working \u201caround the clock to bring home Evan\u201d and other \u201cAmericans being unjustly detained all around the world.\u201d Shortly after the first day of Gershkovich\u2019s trial concluded, the US Embassy in Moscow demanded Russia stop using him and other detained Americans as \u201cbargaining chips.\u201d \u201cThis trial is not about the presentation of evidence, due process or the rule of law. We are talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals,\u201d the embassy said. The number of Americans being held in Russia has swelled in recent years. Paul Whelan, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on espionage charges, which he has consistently and vehemently denied. The US State Department has also declared him wrongfully detained. After marking another grim milestone last week, surpassing 2,000 days in Russian custody, Whelan told CNN he has spent \u201can incredible amount of time\u201d in detention \u201cfor a crime that never occurred\u201d as he urged the Biden administration to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to bring him and Gershkovich home. Brittney Griner \u2013 the basketball star who used to play in Russia during the WNBA offseason \u2013 was detained in Russia and sentenced to nine years in prison after authorities found cannabis oil in her luggage. After spending nearly 300 days behind bars, Griner was freed in a prisoner swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, nicknamed the \u201cMerchant of Death\u201d by his accusers. A former Soviet military officer, Bout was serving a 25-year sentence in the US on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles and provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2013 charges he and the Kremlin denied. The Kremlin has consistently said that any negotiations regarding a potential prisoner swap\u00a0should be conducted in complete confidentiality, without disclosing any details on the progress of these discussions. Western officials and analysts have accused Russia of using jailed Americans as political pawns. Discussing the case of Ksenia Karelina \u2013 a US-Russian dual citizen also on trial in Yekaterinburg after being accused of donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity \u2013 Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov told CNN that Russia aims \u201cto build up a bank of hostages with American passports,\u201d which Moscow can use \u201cas leverage\u201d in any negotiations with Washington. In an interview with American right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested the Kremlin could be willing to free Gershkovich in exchange for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\u201d Putin said.

{"id": "2024_06_27_middleeast_roba-abu-jibba-gaza-treatment-intl-cmd", "text": "Roba Abu Jibba looked shocked as the doctor delivered his news: She couldn\u2019t have the operation she desperately wanted. She nervously scrunched the fabric of her dress, fighting off the tears that began flooding her one remaining eye. The 19-year-old Palestinian woman had pinned all her hopes on getting a prosthetic eye after suffering life-changing injuries in an Israeli strike in Gaza. She was brought to Doha for treatment by the Qatari government. But once again, her dreams were shattered. \u201cI came here, and now they said I won\u2019t be able to get a prosthetic,\u201d she told CNN between sobs. \u201cWhy am I here? I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to see with it but it\u2019s good and my eyes will look the same.\u201d Abu Jibba lost her right eye and the surrounding part of her face in early January when an Israeli bomb hit the warehouse in central Gaza where she and her family had been sheltering for months. Three of her brothers and two of her sisters were killed. Her wounded mother and three surviving siblings tried to get help and left her behind, later believing she was dead. She spent more than three days surrounded by the bodies of her siblings before making it to a hospital \u2013 only to find out there were no doctors there to treat her because most of the medical staff had fled the fighting in the area. A weeks-long CNN investigation into the circumstances of the strike found that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), without any advance warning, attacked an industrial area housing dozens of civilians using a heavy munition, the aftermath of which was consistent with a 2,000-pound bomb, according to weapons experts. The Israeli military told CNN they carried out \u201ca precise strike\u201d after their troops came under fire from that location. Survivors told CNN in January that there were no militants in the warehouse that was hit but did report hearing \u201cresistance fire\u201d in the area. Looking back at that night, Abu Jibba told CNN that she blamed both Israel and Palestinian militants for what happened to her family. She said she believed Hamas or other militants fired a mortar from a nearby area. \u201cI blame the people\u2026,\u201d she said, thinking about her words. \u201cAnd Hamas \u2013 and this situation. Because we were living normally in the warehouse for a month\u2026 If it weren\u2019t for those who fired the mortar, the incident wouldn\u2019t have happened. We didn\u2019t even want to stay in the warehouse, but the (Israelis) made us stay there,\u201d she told CNN, using a pejorative to refer to Israeli troops. \u201cI blame (the Israelis) for killing the children. They spared no one,\u201d she added. Deep wounds Abu Jibba had once been gregarious and outgoing. After seeing her siblings killed in front of her, she became quiet and deeply depressed. Her aunt who accompanied her to Qatar told CNN the young woman now prefers solitude, and rarely goes outside. She spends most of her time looking at photos of her family taken before the war \u2013 the few that she still has. She said her one source of happiness was Mohammed, a friend of her brother. The two met after her family was displaced from their home in Gaza City and became close after the attack in January. When Abu Jibba and her family were separated, and she was hospitalized, Mohammed offered desperately needed emotional support. She said they were going to get engaged and married. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care about what people were saying about my appearance, when people would say, \u2018How could you marry her after she was injured in her eye and body?\u2019 He would say, \u2018I don\u2019t care about her body, I care about what\u2019s in her heart,\u2019\u201d she told CNN. Seven days before Abu Jibba left Gaza for treatment, Mohammed was killed by an artillery shell while collecting firewood in Rafah, she said, adding that her cousin who was with Mohammed was injured in the attack and lost his leg. Abu Jibba said she doesn\u2019t even have a photo of Mohammed, having lost her phone in the carnage. Difficult choices Abu Jibba\u2019s injuries were so severe that Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health put her on a list of people who needed treatment abroad. Three days after CNN\u2019s report on Abu Jibba aired in February, she was cleared for medical evacuation. After weeks of waiting, she was able to cross into Egypt and was then flown to Qatar for treatment. Most of the 2.2 million Palestinians who live in Gaza have never left the strip. Before the war, some 18,000 Gazans had work permits that allowed them to work in Israel. But after Hamas launched its deadly terror attack from Gaza on October 7, Israel shut the borders, in general only allowing foreigners and a few hundred of the most seriously wounded to leave. \u201cIt\u2019s hard leaving your family especially at a time of war and in a difficult situation,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried something else (could) happen to them and I can\u2019t bring them with me.\u201d Abu Jibba told CNN she decided to leave because she believed that doctors could surgically restore her vision. In Egypt, she was told that wouldn\u2019t be possible because her entire eye had been removed but was offered further treatment by the Qatari government. But her stay in Doha has turned into yet another traumatic experience. The doctor told her that Qatar did not offer orbital prosthetic implants and said that her issue was just \u201ccosmetic.\u201d Research has long shown that ocular prosthesis leads to significant improvements in the patient\u2019s physical and psychological health. The prosthetic consists of an artificial eye, eyelids, and any part of the eye socket or the surrounding area missing. It\u2019s a cost-effective and less complicated alternative to reconstructive surgery and is performed routinely across the world. As Abu Jibba left the doctor\u2019s office, the weight of the moment crushed her. She shook and gasped. Panic set in, and she looked like she was reliving the worst moment of her life. She squeezed her hands against her ears, leaning against the wall. Nurses eased her onto a stretcher. She curled up into a ball and hid under a blanket. She is keeping the news away from her mother, fearing the shock might cause her even more pain. \u201cShe pushed me to leave to get the surgery. I don\u2019t want to go back to her with this patch,\u201d she said. \u201cI (need this) so my mother doesn\u2019t see me like this and be depressed.\u201d Later that day, Abu Jibba told CNN that what she wanted more than anything was to go back to Gaza. \u201cYes, there\u2019s a war in Gaza but at least you are with your family and loved ones,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope to God this war is over\u2026 but even if there is war I want to go back.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/middleeast/roba-abu-jibba-gaza-treatment-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_africa_kenya-rocked-by-fresh-protests-intl", "text": "Police in\u00a0Kenya\u00a0fired tear gas on protesters as a fresh wave of demonstrations swept the country, despite President William Ruto\u2019s U-turn on controversial tax plans. Fresh protests dubbed \u201cOne Million People March\u201d began Thursday, with demonstrators calling for roads leading to the capital Nairobi to be blocked. Others threatened to occupy the State House, the president\u2019s office,\u00a0and the official residence. In a surprise move on Wednesday, Ruto said he would not sign the finance bill, saying he had been \u201clistening keenly\u201d to the Kenyan people. He had been facing escalating protests over the bill, with a civil society organization saying at least 23 people had died in clashes. But so far his move has failed to quell the demonstrations. Security forces have set up roadblocks around routes leading to the State House while other parts of the capital city have been fortified with heavy police presence. \u201cIt\u2019s more than about the finance bill now,\u201d Maria, a Kenyan protestor from Nairobi told CNN. \u201c(They\u2019re) killing us as young people for what? We come in peace,\u201d she added. Despite being billed as a \u2018million people march,\u2019 turnout was noticeably lower in Nairobi\u2019s central business district, a CNN team observed. The heavy security presence within the city deterred a crowd from forming with police shouting at protesters to \u201cgo home\u201d in Swahili. What the largely youthful protesters now want varies. Some have called on President Ruto to resign for failing to withdraw the unpopular bill much earlier to save the lives lost. Others are seeking justice for the deceased protesters and demanding the recall of lawmakers who voted in support of the finance bill. \u201cI want them to listen to me,\u201d another protester told CNN. Civic groups such as the Law Society of\u00a0Kenya\u00a0are calling for the removal of\u00a0Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and Nairobi\u2019s regional police commander after officers were accused of reportedly shooting dead protesters. Kenya, East Africa\u2019s dominant economy, has grappled with escalating living costs that have spiked food prices and other commodities. The nation also owes billions of dollars in foreign and local debts, spending a sizeable chunk of its revenue repaying its creditors. \u201cI am not going to preside over a bankrupt country, I am not going to preside over a country that is in debt distress,\u201d President Ruto said last month while defending his plans. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern about a \u201csignificant shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s \u201ctax revenue collection\u201d while urging its government to consider measures to shore up its earnings to reduce borrowing. The bill proposed levies on locally produced products, such as diapers and sanitary towels, including taxes on motor vehicles, and\u00a0mobile money transfer fees, among others. Last week, Ruto shelved some of those taxes, but Kenyans remain angry, and called for the bill to\u00a0be\u00a0scrapped completely. International financial ratings\u00a0agency\u00a0Moody\u2019s warned that scrapping the bill \u201cwill create a revenue shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s budgeting. Ruto warned of spending cuts across government financing if the tax measures were withdrawn. Ruto\u2019s leadership is now being tested like never before. His ability to navigate this period of unrest will be critical not only for his political survival but also for the stability of\u00a0Kenya. The ongoing protests suggest that mere policy reversals may not be sufficient. Analyst Herman Manyora, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi,\u00a0told CNN the\u00a0president\u00a0may need to engage in more substantial reforms to restore faith in his administration. \u201cThe way forward is for the president to go a little more than he has done now in order to get the goodwill of the people,\u201d Manyora said. \u201cHe needs to reshuffle his cabinet and economic advisers which will send a signal that will create the goodwill required. At that point, a government-led conversation can take place.\u201d Ruto, whose rise to the presidency was largely propelled by youth voters said in his address retracting the finance bill that he hoped to engage with young people in the country to listen to their ideas and proposals on how to solve the nation\u2019s economic challenges. But that won\u2019t come easy, Manyora said. \u201cThey (young people) feel betrayed. That\u2019s what is fueling this riot.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/africa/kenya-rocked-by-fresh-protests-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said a suspected balloon was seen flying in northern Gyeonggi Province, which borders Seoul, around 9 p.m. local time (8 p.m. ET). About 100 of the\u00a0balloons\u00a0fell inside\u00a0South\u00a0Korean\u00a0regions, most of which were found in\u00a0north\u00a0of Gyeonggi Province and capital Seoul with \u201cno hazardous substances\u201d found so far, it said. Seoul\u2019s Metropolitan government later sent out a push notification alerting the city that a North Korean balloon had entered the sky over Seoul, adding that citizens should refrain from touching downed balloons and report any sightings to authorities. The South Korean military has\u00a0warned it could restart loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts at the border \u2014 which it had paused for the last few years \u2014\u00a0adding whether Seoul resumes the loudspeakers is \u201cup to\u00a0North\u00a0Korea\u2019s actions.\u201d \u201cOur military is ready to immediately start anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts, and will operate with flexibility according to the strategical and operational situation,\u201d said the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday. North Korea has sent over 1,000 balloons toward the South since May, which\u00a0it calls\u00a0reprisals for South Korean activists flying leaflets that contain materials critical of the regime of its leader Kim Jong\u00a0Un. On Thursday, a South Korean advocacy group flew 20 large balloons carrying thousands of anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets and USB sticks with South Korean entertainment toward North Korea. A day later, on Friday, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea\u2019s leader, warned of \u201ctrouble\u201d ahead. \u201cWhen you do something you were clearly warned not to do, it\u2019s only natural that you will find yourself dealing with something you didn\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. A South Korean analysis of North Korean balloons sent between late May and early June detected parasites in the balloons\u2019 soil, which \u201cmay have originated from human feces,\u201d the ministry said, pointing to \u201chuman genes\u201d found in the soil. The analysis found roundworms, whipworms and larva currens along with other waste, such as cloth and wastepaper, the ministry said, adding there was no risk of contamination or infectious disease from the analyzed soil. The balloons also carried damaged clothes from a South Korean brand, signaling \u201chostility towards South Korean goods,\u201d as well as clothes with imitations of Disney characters, according to the ministry. The latest balloon salvo comes as tensions on the Korean Peninsula heighten, and inter-Korean diplomacy remains at an impasse.\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a defense agreement with North Korea last week as talks on its denuclearization efforts have stalled, and Kim has\u00a0vowed to expand his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal\u00a0and threatened to use it against the South. In the meantime, a US Navy aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea over the weekend ahead of trilateral exercises with South Korea and Japan in the waters near the peninsula. It is the latest in a series of US military moves aiming to affirm Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to its treaty ally in South Korea. US and South Korean officials signed a\u00a0new memorandum of understanding\u00a0on diplomatic intelligence sharing and analysis on Monday, according to South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry. Japanese, South Korean and U.S. officials also held a trilateral call where they issued a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0that called the deepening security cooperation between Russia and North Korea a matter of \u201cgrave concern\u201d to those seeking to maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula. \u201cThe United States, ROK, and Japan condemn in the strongest possible terms deepening military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia, including continued arms transfers from the DPRK to Russia that prolong the suffering of the Ukrainian people, violate multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and threaten stability in both Northeast Asia and Europe,\u201d the statement said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/north-korean-balloons-south-korea-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

But enormous problems still loom ashore. The US military says it is now moving about 800 pallets of humanitarian aid per day to Gaza via the temporary pier, or roughly 40 trucks. But for now, that aid isn\u2019t helping to alleviate the worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where more than 2 million people are facing crisis, emergency, or catastrophic levels of food insecurity according to a new report. More than 6,000 pallets of aid delivered via the pier are stacked and awaiting pickup onshore, US military officials said, as the World Food Program has suspended aid collections due to security concerns. CNN was granted access to the pier on Tuesday for the first time since it was first anchored to the Gaza coastline last month, witnessing trucks driving off a logistical vessel, across the pier and onto the Gaza shoreline. The pier is composed of interlocking floating platforms made of hundreds of tons of steel that rumble as each wave passes underneath. Tug boats on either side help keep the platform stable. An Israeli military division is charged with ensuring the security of US military personnel and civilian truck drivers in the area and a US C-RAM air defense system capable of intercepting mortars provides an extra layer of protection. The visit also gave CNN rare access to witness up close the tremendous destruction that nearly nine months of war have wrought on Gaza\u2019s coastline, with most buildings in sight either flattened or heavily damaged. Beyond the bombed-out buildings, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is growing increasingly desperate once again, particularly in northern Gaza, where hunger is on the rise. Humanitarian aid operations in Gaza have been severely hampered by an increase in Israeli military operations over the past month and humanitarian aid officials say lawlessness and looting are also on the rise. The Israeli military says it has been getting hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza recently, blaming humanitarian aid agencies\u2019 lack of capacity for not picking up and distributing the aid. But aid groups say their efforts are hampered by a lack of communication with the Israeli military that leaves them at risk of being caught in the crossfire. US President Joe Biden announced plans to build the pier during his State of the Union address, vowing it would \u201cenable a massive increase\u201d in humanitarian aid getting into Gaza. But bad weather and rough seas have hampered that effort, damaging the pier and taking it offline for weeks over the last month-and-a-half. The Pentagon has said it is committed to keeping the pier operational, despite reports that it was considering shutting the project down altogether. Pressed on criticism from humanitarian aid groups that the US\u2019s $230-million effort would have been better spent pressuring Israel to get more aid into Gaza via land routes, Capt. Joel Stewart, the senior Navy officer involved in the operation, told CNN the pier was always intended to be \u201ca surge response\u201d and not a \u201clong-term solution.\u201d \u201cThe sea is a difficult task-mistress. Unpredictable. Each wave is different than the last, so dealing with that is a challenge,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve adapted to that and I think we\u2019re in a better position now than we were initially.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/us-military-pier-gaza-uncollected-aid-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_weather_south-heat-wave-midwest-flood-recovery", "text": "Dangerous heat is setting its sights on millions of Americans across the South and Plains on Monday, including several communities recovering from destructive flooding over the weekend. Here\u2019s the latest. \u2022 Heat heads to the South: The unrelenting heat shifts into the South and Southern Plains on Monday and Tuesday, bringing temperatures in the mid to upper 90s. Some cities could even see 100-degree highs, including Dallas and Little Rock, Arkansas. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels in humidity and high temperatures \u2013 could top a dangerous 110 degrees in some areas. \u2022 Minnesota dam compromised: Southern Minnesota\u2019s Rapidan Dam is in \u201cimminent failure condition\u201d after this weekend\u2019s dangerous flooding, Blue Earth County Emergency Management warned Monday. The dam \u2013 about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis \u2013 was intact as of late Monday morning, but water was flowing around it. No evacuation orders were issued as of late Monday morning. \u2022 Flood-stricken communities begin recovery amid sweltering heat: Heat alerts on Monday spread over 1,000 miles from North Florida to South Dakota, which was among several states inundated by heavy rain and devastating flooding over the weekend. Heat advisories are in effect for several areas that were swamped with floodwater over the weekend, including parts of\u00a0northern Iowa, southern South Dakota, eastern Nebraska and northern Missouri and Kansas. President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Iowa after catastrophic flooding forced some communities to evacuate. \u2022 Record-breaking weekend heat: Daily high-temperature records were broken from New York to Mississippi over the weekend, including some that were more than a century old, as a brutal heat wave embraced the mid-Atlantic and I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to New York. Philadelphia hit 98 degrees on Sunday, shattering its 1888 record of 97 degrees. Both Greenville, Mississippi, and Raleigh, North Carolina, saw a record 100 degrees. People in the region can breathe a sigh of relief Monday as cooler temperatures begin to set in. \u2022 Flooding turns deadly in South Dakota: At least one person died during severe flooding in South Dakota, Governor Kristi Noem said. \u201cI want to remind everybody to remember the power of water and the flow of water, and to stay away from flooded areas,\u201d the governor warned. At least nine people were rescued from rising water in Sioux Falls, where emergency personnel reported stranded drivers and dozens of trapped vehicles. And the flood threat still isn\u2019t over \u2013 several rivers in the state are swollen with floodwater and will continue rising over the next few days, Noem said. \u2022 More than 20 rivers at major flood stage: Flood warnings remain across waterlogged areas of South Dakota, Iowa and southern Minnesota, as well as along rivers that are running well above normal. At least 23 river gauges have reached major flood stage in the area, meaning extensive flooding of buildings, main roadways, and other critical infrastructure is possible, according to the National Weather Service. That number is expected to grow as water continues to collect across creeks and streams, eventually dumping into major rivers. \u2022 \u201cMonsoon-like\u201d conditions coming to the Southwest: An influx of tropical moisture \u2013 some of which is from Tropical Storm Alberto \u2013 is bringing \u201cmonsoon-like conditions\u201d to the Southwest, the Weather Prediction Center said. Thunderstorms are possible through midweek as a result. While the rainfall may be welcomed by firefighters battling several active wildfires in the region, too much rain could trigger flooding and debris flows, making it difficult for crews to access burn areas. Where heat will go next A heat dome building over the southwestern and south-central US early this week will push temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal each afternoon in an area spanning from the West into the Southeast. High temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s are expected Monday from southern South Dakota through the Southeast. A handful of daily record high temperatures could fall in parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and a few are at risk in Mississippi. The southern tier of the country will remain the epicenter for sizzling conditions Tuesday with high temperatures in the low 100s likely in the southern Plains and Southeast. Atlanta is forecast to top out in the upper 90s both Tuesday and Wednesday, about 10 degrees above normal for late June. By Wednesday, heat will briefly shift back into some of the same areas of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast that baked last week, but it won\u2019t touch the extreme nature of last week\u2019s oven-like conditions. Temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s will return in the mid-Atlantic and 90s will return as far north as southern New England. A few daily high temperature records are in jeopardy Wednesday \u2013 including DC and Baltimore \u2013 but much of the northeast US will avoid unseasonable heat. Stormy weather maintains flood threat There will be rain chances for heavily flooded areas of the Midwest most of this week. A level 2 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms is in effect over the area Monday and Tuesday and some of these storms could unload rounds of heavy rainfall. Exactly how much rain falls and where depends on how thunderstorms develop each afternoon, but the heaviest storms could unload more than an inch of rain in a short time. That\u2019s more than enough to cause additional flooding concerns in areas that can\u2019t take much more rain. Storms are expected to roar to life each day in the late afternoon or early evening hours and remain a threat overnight. Damaging wind gusts and hail\u00a0are also threats with any severe thunderstorm early this week. After a brief break on Wednesday, additional heavy rain is possible in the same areas Thursday and Friday.

{"id": "2024_06_26_africa_kenyan-president-rejects-finance-bill-intl", "text": "Kenyan President William Ruto said Wednesday that he will not sign a controversial finance bill, backing down in the face of mass protests that swept the country and reportedly left at least 23 people dead. \u201cHaving reflected on the continuing conversation regarding the content of the finance bill 2024, and listening keenly to the people of Kenya who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this Finance Bill 2024, I concede, and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill,\u201d Ruto said during a television address Wednesday. \u201cThe people have spoken,\u201d Ruto said. \u201cFollowing the passage of the bill, the country experienced widespread expression of dissatisfaction with the bill as passed, regrettably resulting in the loss of life, the destruction of property and desecration of constitutional institutions.\u201d Protesters in Kenya say they will go ahead with a \u201cOne Million People March\u201d on Thursday despite Ruto accepting their key demand of scrapping the bill. A\u00a0poster shared widely\u00a0on social media calls on all generations to return to the streets across the country on Thursday and block roads leading to the capital Nairobi. Some protesters have also called for people to occupy the State House in Nairobi. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken with Ruto since the clashes to urge restraint. According to a State Department readout of their call, Blinken \u201cunderscored the importance of security forces demonstrating restraint and refraining from violence and encouraged prompt investigations into allegations of human rights abuses.\u201d Kenya, a nation often praised for its stability, had seen escalating protests over the bill, which the government introduced to rein in public debt. Last week, the government\u00a0scrapped\u00a0some tax increases, including a proposed 16% value-added tax on bread along with taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil and mobile money transfers. But the concessions were not enough to quell protests amid the\u00a0rising cost of living. On Tuesday they turned deadly when security forces fired teargas and live ammunition at protesters. Dramatic scenes in the nation\u2019s capital Nairobi saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from the parliament in the melee. Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from the parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported. At least 23 people died in the violence, according to Kenya\u2019s Police Reforms Working Group, (PRWG) a civil society organization. The PRWG alleged in a statement published by Amnesty International Kenya that police targeted young, unarmed protesters outside the parliament, with the violence continuing into the night. They added that \u201creports show police shot several people in Githurai, Nairobi, one over 40 times \u2014 between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m., way after the protest ended.\u201d This was in contrast to details given by Ruto, who said in his speech that six people died. \u201cI send my condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones in this very unfortunate manner,\u201d Ruto added. \u201cThere is need for us as a nation to pick up from here and go into the future,\u201d Ruto said, adding that he would hold an engagement with the young people at the forefront of the protests to hear their ideas and proposals. The Law Society of Kenya is calling for the resignation of Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and the Nairobi regional commander over officers allegedly shooting protesters. \u201cWe saw plainclothes policemen shooting protesters as early as 11 a.m. There was a clear directive to kill protesters,\u201d Law Society of Kenya president Faith Odhiambo alleged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday evening. \u201cThere was no intent to let the protesters move around.\u201d The Law Society also said the police \u201cabducted\u201d several prominent social media users connected to the protests, and six people remain missing. \u201cThe reports from those who have been freed is that they were taken blindfolded and handcuffed, and they didn\u2019t know where they were,\u201d she told CNN, after the society secured the release of six people. \u201cEven after they come out, most of them are quite shaken and afraid and want to go into hiding. Our message to the government is that if a country is built on fear, one day people will stop fearing. And that\u2019s what we saw on Tuesday.\u201d Ruto\u2019s change of heart came as a surprise to some who observed his hardline stance just a day earlier. During a nationwide address after the parliament was set alight, Ruto said the events on Tuesday were a grave threat to \u201cnational security\u201d and that the conversation around the bill had been \u201chijacked by dangerous people.\u201d Kenyan analyst Herman Manyora said withdrawing the bill much earlier could have saved the lives lost on Tuesday. \u201cHis announcement should have come earlier. He has done today what he should have done two days ago to avoid what we went through yesterday. It pains me that we had to wait \u2026 for us to do what we should have done on Monday \u2026 and that\u2019s a general feeling among people,\u201d Manyora told CNN.

{"id": "2024_06_26_style_last-safe-abortion-photos", "text": "Sixty years ago this month, a young woman died alone from a self-induced abortion she and her lover had conducted on a motel room floor in Norwich, Connecticut. Her name was Gerri Santoro. Santoro\u2019s death was one of many \u2014 all too many \u2014 which activists and healthcare workers sought to avoid by legalizing abortions and abortion care in the United States. But she became a particular symbol of this movement when a graphic police photograph of her dead body was printed in the feminist publication Ms. Magazine in April 1973, just a few months after the US Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision\u00a0legally protected\u00a0the medical procedure. Today, in the aftermath of that half-century-old ruling being overturned on June 24, 2022 \u2014 a decision which some people fear has triggered the resurgence of conditions,\u00a0and restrictions,\u00a0similar to those that contributed to Santoro\u2019s death \u2014 one artist is reinvigorating visual advocacy of abortion, aiming to change the cultural mindset toward it and those who provide the procedure. Carmen Winant\u2019s new photobook, \u201cThe Last Safe Abortion,\u201d also seeks to memorialize the labor, advocacy and community-building of abortion care providers and women\u2019s health care workers in the near-50-year period that the right to an abortion was legally protected\u00a0across the US. Though particularly salient at this time, Winant\u2019s book isn\u2019t a direct response to the Roe repeal, she told CNN. Rather, the idea had been percolating in her mind for some time, she explained, sparked by having to regularly circumnavigate \u201caggressive\u201d anti-abortion activists proselytizing on the campus of Ohio State University, where she\u2019s an associate professor in the art department. \u201cTheir (visual) strategy is really clear and specific and has been specific for the past three or four decades: blowing up these photographs of so-called aborted fetuses that are really gory and sensational, and using (them) as a confrontational device,\u201d Winant said. \u201cIt really ignited this line of inquiry \u2026 around photography and movement building and consciousness raising. \u201cWhere are our pictures? Where are the pictures of people who are pro-choice and invested in reproductive justice and health care work?\u201d Winant recalled thinking. \u201cWhy have we been so reticent or slow to utilize pictures in our movements?\u201d MYA Network, a national group of clinicians, activists and patients working to normalize abortion care, has also embraced this effort. One of MYA\u2019s initiatives is The Issue of Tissue, which depicts fetal tissues up to around nine weeks old, showing the reality of what early abortions look like, in contrast to the often misleading images long circulated by anti-abortion advocates. Winant is actually best known for her work on birth \u2014 particularly a 2018 Museum of Modern Art exhibit called \u201cMy Birth,\u201d which showed more than 2,000 found photographs \u2014 largely from the 1970s \u2014 drawing from birthing experiences, birth workers and feminist literature. \u201cI am moved by birth in its own right \u2014 as a mysterious and expansive phenomenological experience \u2014 but most of all I am interested in it as a channel through which to study feminist healthcare networks and the building of radical social movements,\u201d Winant wrote in her book. \u201cGiving women information (pictorial or otherwise) about their bodies is a tool of feminist world-building.\u201d \u201cThe Last Safe Abortion\u201d is a continuation of this theme, Winant says. The book demands that the labor and humanity of abortion care providers \u2014 often both invisible and vilified \u2014 be included and appreciated in social and political conversations about reproductive rights, which often also ignore birthing people and women\u2019s healthcare workers. \u201cIt was really important for me to politically put people back in the picture,\u201d Winant told CNN. A long fight for the right to choose Winant drew the collection of photos she curated for her book from more than a dozen institutional, organizational and personal archives, as well as her own, largely centered on the Midwest \u2014 a \u201cparticularly vulnerable area\u201d for reproductive rights, she said.\u00a0  The first photographs in the book are of the interiors of a clinic waiting room, putting viewers into the shoes of a hypothetical staffer or patient who has just walked in, Winant said. From here, the goings on are all too ordinary \u2014 and mundane: Clinic employees demonstrate procedures, replace batteries in clocks, hold workshops, sterilize equipment, check patients in for appointments and celebrate each other\u2019s birthdays. Notably, none show strife or confrontations with protestors, in contrast to the visual narratives that often surround abortion care. The clinics exist in their own context, as a place of safety and community. \u201cThat also felt political: to demonstrate that this work is quotidian and regular and unsensational,\u201d Winant said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much care and dignity \u2014 small steps that are put into making people feel safe. It\u2019s such a significant part of their job.\u201d To Winant, something as simple as answering phones represented a heroic act of solidarity \u2014 \u201cnetworking to save each other\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. The book\u2019s title reflects this mission. As Winant spoke with clinics and their staff in the wake of the Roe overturning, one refrain she consistently heard was the promise and determination to \u201cprovide the last safe abortion\u201d in their state. \u201c\u2018If we do the last legal abortion in Ohio, that is what we will do. We will stay open for as long as we possibly can,\u2019\u201d Winant recalled one staffer saying. \u201cWords as resolute as they are elegiac.\u201d Winant has never really been interested in art for art\u2019s sake, she told CNN, but rather in how it \u201ccirculates in the world and (its) power to impact people on a political level, but also on a deeper level, like something more cellular.\u201d Winant\u2019s work, as well as her own life, also rejects the notion that people who support or have abortions live on one side of the binary to which the debate over abortion rights is often reduced. \u201cThe right to be pregnant and give birth has everything to do with a right to be what feminists would call \u2018unpregnant,\u2019 and not to give birth,\u201d Winant said. \u201cAs someone who has had children, as someone who has had an abortion, that is the same struggle (when) it comes to choice \u2014 and not only our own choices, but the feminist health care networks that support those choices.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/style/last-safe-abortion-photos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_icc-arrest-warrants-shoigu-gerasimov-intl", "text": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov for alleged international crimes, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said Tuesday the pair were allegedly responsible for two war crimes: directing attacks at civilian objects and causing excessive incidental harm to civilians or damage to civilian objects. They are also accused of committing crimes against humanity. On the same day, Europe\u2019s top court found Russia guilty of systemic human rights violations in occupied Crimea committed since February 2014, marking a victory for Kyiv in its first interstate hearing brought against Moscow over the peninsula that could pave the way for more such cases. Following the ICC\u2019s announcement, Russian state news agency TASS quoted the Security Council of Russia, the government body headed by Shoigu, as calling the the court\u2019s decision \u201cnull and void.\u201d \u201cIt is meaningless, as the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to Russia, and [the decision] was made within the framework of the West\u2019s hybrid war against our country,\u201d TASS quoted the body as saying. Ukrainian officials welcomed the ICC\u2019s announcement on Tuesday. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the decision shows that \u201cno military rank or cabinet door can shield Russian criminals from accountability.\u201d The country\u2019s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said the ICC decision meant Ukraine was a step closer to getting justice. \u201cSooner or later, a just punishment will overtake every war criminal!\u201d he said in a statement posted on his Telegram. Andriy\u00a0Yermak, the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, said Shoigu and Gerasimov were being held \u201cindividually responsible.\u201d \u201cThis is an important decision. Everyone will be held accountable for evil,\u201d he said in a statement. The arrest warrants put Shoigu and Gerasimov on the ICC\u2019s wanted list, although it is uncertain whether they will ever stand trial. The court does not conduct trials in absentia and it is unlikely they would be handed over by Moscow. The two warrants bring the total number of top Russian officials wanted for war crimes to four as the ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0and Russian official\u00a0Maria Lvova-Belova\u00a0for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute, the ICC operates independently. Most countries \u2013 124 of them \u2013 are parties to the treaty, but there are notable exceptions, including the United States, Russia and Ukraine. Under the Rome Statue, any country that is a signatory is obliged to arrest and hand over anyone facing an ICC arrest warrant. Crimea human rights ruling In a separate case Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights unanimously ruled that Russia violated 11 articles of the European Convention of Human Rights in Crimea, which was annexed by Moscow following its illegal invasion of the peninsula 10 years ago. They included violations of the rights to life, liberty, security and a fair trial, and the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment, according to a court news release. The court also found that Russia violated three protocols of the European Convention: the protection of property, the right to education, and the freedom of movement. The court ruled Russia must safely return prisoners who were taken from Crimea into Russia. Some of the violations that Russia was found guilty of date back to 2014. Margarita Sokorenko, Commissioner for the European Court of Human Rights of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, said the ruling \u201cessentially nullifies Russia\u2019s decades-long claims that human rights in Crimea are respected.\u201d Russia has previously denied allegations of human rights violations in Crimea, and was expelled from the Council of Europe in March 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In response, Moscow removed itself from the European court\u2019s jurisdiction, and set March 15, 2022 as a cut-off point after which it claimed any rulings made against Russia would not count. Harming civilians Shoigu, one of the Russian nationals wanted by the ICC, is a long-time close ally of Putin who served as Russia\u2019s defense minister for 12 years. He was fired by Putin last month, replaced with the economist Andrey Belousov. He led the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which caught Kyiv by surprise but was soon pushed back, exposing the weaknesses of Moscow\u2019s corruption-riddled military. Still, Shoigu has remained a popular politician in Russia. Having spent two decades as the minister of emergency situations, he cultivated an image of an official who brings help when it\u2019s needed. Gerasimov, meanwhile, has been at the helm of Russia\u2019s armed forces for more than a decade. He was one of a small group of people responsible for planning the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He was formally appointed as the overall commander of the campaign in January 2023. The ICC said the alleged crimes relate to \u201ca large number of strikes against numerous electric power plants and sub-stations\u201d that were carried out by the Russia across Ukraine between October 2022 and at least March 2023. The panel of three judges who made the decision to issue the arrest warrants on Monday concluded that Shoigu and Gerasimov ordered strikes against civilian objects, which constitutes a war crime under international humanitarian laws. The judges also said that even though some of the targets could have been seen as relevant to Russia\u2019s military campaign at that time, it was clear that striking them would cause harm to civilians and that the expected harm would be excessive compared to the military advantage of hitting them. The court\u2019s prosecutor Karim Khan said in a separate statement on Tuesday that the Russian campaign at that time represented \u201ca course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts against a civilian population.\u201d As such, he said, the actions by Shoigu and Gerasimov may amount to a crime against humanity. That designation is reserved for the most serious crimes committed as part of a widespread, systemic attack directed at a civilian population.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/icc-arrest-warrants-shoigu-gerasimov-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Islamic Police played a \u201cpivotal role\u201d in the system that al Qaeda, alongside Islamist group Ansar Dine, put in place to commit crimes against humanity and war crimes in Timbuktu between April 2012 and May 2013, the ICC said. Al Hassan was convicted by majority of directly committing, contributing to, or aiding and abetting crimes against humanity of torture and war crimes of torture and outrages upon personal dignity, the ICC confirmed. The court, in the Dutch city of The Hague, acquitted him of crimes related to rape, sexual slavery, forced marriage and attacking protected objects due to insufficient evidence that he was responsible, the statement said. The ICC said that 2,196 victims participated in the trial proceedings. Across 195 hearings, 7,896 documents were recorded and 13,275 items of evidence were submitted, the court said.

He denied the charges. He was extradited from Honduras after the US Department of Justice filed three drug-trafficking and firearms related charges against him in 2022.

In exchange, prosecutors said, Hern\u00e1ndez received millions of dollars in bribes that he used to fuel his rise in Honduran politics. Hern\u00e1ndez was president of Honduras from 2014 until 2022. During his years in office, he \u201cprotected and enriched the drug traffickers in his inner circle,\u201d the Justice Department said, citing his use of executive power to support extraditions to the US of certain drug traffickers \u201cwho threatened his grip on power\u201d while \u201cpromising drug traffickers who paid him and followed his instructions that they would remain in Honduras.\u201d Prosecutors also said that members of the conspiracy in which Hern\u00e1ndez participated relied on the Honduran National Police to protect cocaine shipments as they moved through the country. In a statement, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Hern\u00e1ndez \u201cabused his position as president of Honduras to operate the country as a narco-state where violent drug traffickers were allowed to operate with virtual impunity, and the people of Honduras and the United States were forced to suffer the consequences.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/americas/juan-orlando-hernandez-sentencing-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Preparations are being made for Modi\u2019s visit to Moscow and dates will be announced soon, Kremlin spokesperson Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russia\u2019s state-owned TASS news agency. \u201cI can confirm that we are preparing a visit by the Prime Minister of India,\u201d he said, according to TASS. \u201cI can\u2019t say about the dates yet, because the dates are announced by the parties in agreement. But we are actively preparing. And this visit will happen.\u201d CNN has contacted India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs for comment. The upcoming trip will be Modi\u2019s first to the country since 2019 and comes less than a month\u00a0after he was narrowly re-elected as prime minister during a weekslong vote. Modi\u00a0last met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan in 2022, where he told the leader that today\u2019s era is \u201cnot of war\u201d. Putin also visited New Delhi just months before his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. India\u2019s ties with Russia date back decades to the Cold War and have remained strong despite repeated sanctions on Moscow from Western governments. New Delhi has repeatedly abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations and has avoided public criticism of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment \u2013 a vital link given India\u2019s ongoing tensions at its shared Himalayan border with China \u2013 and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces global isolation. At the same time, India\u2019s ties with the United States have grown stronger, amid shared concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington last June, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_06_27_travel_restaurants-bars-age-restrictions-bliss-cec", "text": "When Johnny B. Barounis opened The Auction House in New York\u2019s Upper East Side in 1993, he knew he wanted to deter a certain type of customer in their early 20s \u2014 in his words, \u201cthose kids that had their flannel shirts tied around their waists, wearing their Villanova hats backwards, walking around in the street with their Amstel Light in their hand.\u201d He deliberately cultivated an atmosphere at his bar that he felt might intimidate a fresh-out-of-college 20-something: rich velvet drapes, crystal chandeliers, antique furniture. On Fridays and Saturdays, the message was more explicit: Only patrons 25 and up were allowed in the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t need a 21-year-old to come in with two of his friends, to make a ruckus and then get sick in the bathroom,\u201d Barounis says. Barounis says his age policy was rare back then, and some at the time questioned his decision to keep out younger customers. Three decades later, the bar is something of an institution \u2014 and the 25-and-up policy on weekends was so well-received that he implemented it at his sister bar, The Back Room. Today, plenty of bars and lounges around the US impose similar \u2014 if not stricter \u2014 age restrictions, hoping to curb unruly behavior sometimes exhibited by newly legal drinkers and appeal to an older crowd. But such age limits are still unusual at restaurants, as evidenced by the recent controversy around a Missouri eatery. Bliss, an upscale Caribbean restaurant that opened last month in the suburbs of St. Louis, provoked numerous headlines and fervent debate for limiting entry to women 30 and up and men 35 and up. As Barounis sees it, the uproar over the restaurant\u2019s age policy suggests it might have been too extreme. \u201cThe difference between 21 and 25 is greater than 25 and 35,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere do you draw the line?\u201d How the owner of Bliss chooses to run his business is, of course, his prerogative, Barounis and others in the hospitality industry say. But the conversation around the restaurant\u2019s unconventional age policy raises some interesting questions: To what extent can businesses dictate who their customers are? And to what extent should they? Plenty of customers appreciate age restrictions Generally, society seems to have reached a tacit (if begrudging) acceptance of age restrictions at certain establishments. Bars like Barounis\u2019 Auction House have long operated without issue, catering to customers seeking a night out without potential disruptions from patrons who haven\u2019t yet learned how to handle their liquor. Some restaurants have seen increased reservations and sales after instituting bans on young children. And adults-only hotels and resorts are popular for a reason. In fact, Bliss owner Marvin Pate tells CNN his positive dining experiences at adults-only resorts are what inspired his restaurant\u2019s age policy. He and his wife Tina Pate, both 42, found that there was a demand among people their age for an elevated spot where they could kick back, relax and hear the music they grew up listening to. \u201cWhy not just make a lounge type of feel at a resort but in a restaurant setting?\u201d Pate says of his thinking behind Bliss. \u201cMajority of (places) around the country, if you go to a place that\u2019s 35 and up, it\u2019s actually a lounge with fried food. We thought about the concept of a restaurant that\u2019s daily, where people could \u2026 get a luxe environment and just enjoy themselves with actual cooked food.\u201d Judging by the comments on the Bliss Facebook page, many customers welcome the laid-back, mature environment that Bliss promises. Several people urged the restaurant not to backtrack on its age policy despite the criticism it has received, while a few joked that they wouldn\u2019t take issue with an even higher age limit. Still, some in the comments objected to the idea that age was a reliable proxy for maturity level. Others questioned whether Bliss\u2019 stringent policy of carding people at the door was necessary to achieve the sophisticated ambiance that Pate envisioned. Would 20-somethings even want to hang out in a place where a majority of the clientele is in its 30s and 40s? \u201cAn age restriction for a restaurant is a bit of a reach unless it\u2019s a bar and event space too IMO,\u201d one commenter said. \u201cIf they want to deter disruptive crowds it\u2019s better to raise the price range not the age range.\u201d However objectionable some patrons find these age restrictions, such policies don\u2019t generally constitute age discrimination, says Trey Lindley, a civil litigator in North Carolina with the business law firm Lord & Lindley. Businesses generally have the right to set their own guidelines for service, as long as it isn\u2019t on the basis of federally protected categories such as race, religion, national origin or disability, according to Lindley. Think of the \u201cno shirts, no shoes, no service\u201d signs that proliferated in the early 1970s or Covid-era mask mandates. Though federal law prohibits age discrimination within the context of employment, Lindley notes that age isn\u2019t typically a protected characteristic when it comes to federal and state laws banning discrimination in public places. Provided that an establishment has a logical reason for its rules and enforces them uniformly, he says it generally has the right to do so. \u201cI think the biggest concern for restaurants who want to do this is potential blowback,\u201d he adds. Different age policies for men and women raise questions When bars or restaurants institute age requirements, it inevitably elicits some grumbling from those who feel excluded. Just last month, Donerick\u2019s Pub in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, made headlines for raising its age limit to 30 and older on Fridays and Saturdays. And each time a restaurant announces a policy restricting children, it inspires intense debate across social media. While there seemed to be a few people who were upset that Bliss implemented age restrictions at all, some of the criticism focused on the fact that the rules are different for men and women. Bliss defended its policy of allowing women 30-plus and men 35-plus, writing in a May Facebook post that it intends to create a \u201cgrown and sexy atmosphere\u201d and helps to \u201cmaintain a sophisticated environment, uphold our standards, and support the sustainability of our unique ambiance.\u201d Pate says the restaurant initially planned to institute a 35-and-up policy for both men and women, but lowered the threshold for women to cater to what he called \u201cladies night out\u201d \u2014 referring to young professional women gathering with female friends for happy hours and other social events. The five-year gap struck some customers as arbitrary, with some women who met the age requirements expressing frustration that they couldn\u2019t visit Bliss with their male partners. \u201cWhy can I come at age 30, but my husband who will be 33 this year can\u2019t?\u201d one user commented on a Facebook post from Bliss. \u201cAssuming that all young people are going to cause problems is cutting out a huge crowd of people who would bring in more business.\u201d \u201cMay I ask why the men have to be older than the women? I would love to be able to come with my fianc\u00e9 (who\u2019s older than me), but he\u2019s not 35 for 2 more years,\u201d another person wrote. Bliss\u2019 age discrepancy may be especially stark, but separate policies for men and women aren\u2019t unheard of among bars and nightclubs. Barounis, for example, recalled working at a bar in Long Island decades ago that barred women under 23 and men under 25. And for years, bars and nightclubs enticed both male and female customers by offering discounted or free drinks for women. Even if Bliss\u2019 rules likely don\u2019t constitute age discrimination, Lindley says the gender discrepancy could open the restaurant to litigation. But Pate maintains that the policies at Bliss aren\u2019t intended to discriminate against anyone. He says the goal is simply to provide a relaxing atmosphere for older customers and adds that he didn\u2019t think the restrictions were out of the norm. Experts say age-exclusive establishments are unlikely to become a trend Though restaurant and bar owners can generally set their own rules on who they allow in, hospitality industry experts that spoke to CNN are doubtful that age-exclusive establishments will become a trend. Excluding patrons under 35 or 30 omits an otherwise desirable slice of the market, says Jason Kaplan, CEO of the restaurant consulting firm JK Consulting. While bars may be able to get away with higher age restrictions, he says he wouldn\u2019t recommend such a strict policy for restaurants given that profit margins on food are much lower. Younger generations tend to spend more money on drinking and eating out, and Kaplan says it\u2019s unlikely that most businesses would want to give that up. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about that sweet spot between young professionals that you\u2019re basically going to eliminate, who are willing to pay for experiences,\u201d Kaplan says. Eddie Fahmy, CEO of A2Z Restaurant Consulting, agrees. He understands why a bar might impose age limits only on certain days, but to him, shutting out a younger demographic entirely is a risky business decision. \u201cIf you\u2019re a restaurant and you want to make money selling food and serving customers, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d he adds. But other establishments with strict age policies say the business model works for them. Toya Taylor, owner of the San Antonio-based 30-plus lounge Horizons & More, says she knows she\u2019s probably losing some business by barring people under 30, but she also feels that doing so reduces her liability. \u201cThe places that are starting (to use age restrictions) are going to see good results, especially if they stick to it,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, Barounis notes that the buzz generated over Bliss\u2019 age requirements could work in its favor, and he\u2019s eager to see whether the restaurant finds success with its unusual policy or whether it ultimately reverses course. Pate, Bliss\u2019 owner, says he\u2019s not going anywhere. And when those younger customers finally turn 30 or 35, Bliss will be there, waiting to welcome them in. \u201cI feel like we have (filled) a big void that was needed inside American society and just the culture in general,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople were asking for this, and we just gave the people what they want.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/travel/restaurants-bars-age-restrictions-bliss-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_france-debate-attal-bardella-bompard-intl", "text": "Three of France\u2019s highest-profile candidates in the country\u2019s upcoming legislative elections sparred in the first major debate of the campaign on Tuesday. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal squared off against Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally, and Manuel Bompard of the leftist alliance dubbed the New Popular Front in a wide-ranging, sometimes chaotic two-hour affair. Attal, 35, and Bardella, 28, are two of the country\u2019s youngest and most popular politicians.\u00a0After serving in various positions in Macron\u2019s government, Attal was named the youngest prime minister in French history earlier this year. Bardella led the National Rally to a dominant showing at the European elections on June 9. Bompard, 38, does not have the same sort of name recognition or leadership position. He was elected to the French National Assembly in 2022 representing Marseille and is a member of the far-left political party France Unbowed. None of the three candidates appeared to land any knockout blows or move the needle enough to sway the opinion of voters. Bardella didn\u2019t appear to sufficiently address criticisms that his party platform is short of specifics. Attal didn\u2019t seem to give angry voters a reason to opt for continuity. And Bompard\u2019s presence on the stage served as a reminder to voters that the left has not yet decided who will lead them if they win the vote. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a punchline that was striking or impactful,\u201d said Jean Petaux, a political scientist and expert in French politics. French voters will head to the polls on June 30 and July 7 for a two-round snap election that President Emmanuel Macron called after the National Rally crushed his centrist political movement during the European elections. The move took the French political establishment and society at large by surprise. Not even Attal was aware he was about to lose his job until shortly before the announcement. Macron framed the decision as an exercise in democracy, an opportunity for the French to clarify who they want running the country. But it\u2019s incredibly risky. Macron is gambling that the higher stakes national vote, which draws greater turnout and more scrutiny than European contests, will see the French spurn the National Rally\u2019s anti-immigrant, euroskeptic agenda in favor of more moderate political forces. He\u2019s also assuming that French voters use the runoff, as they have historically, to keep the far right out of power. As things stand, however, Macron will lose his bet. Opinion polls conducted since the snap elections were announced show the National Rally\u2019s momentum has continued to hold, while France\u2019s numerous left-leaning parties have put aside their various ideological differences to jointly field candidates across the country. A survey released on Sunday by pollster IFOP found the National Rally leading all parties with the support of 35% of voters. The New Popular Front, the leftist alliance, came in second with 30% and Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble dropped to third with 20%. If those results hold, the French legislature would be thrown into a state of political paralysis. No party would amass enough votes to meet the 289-seat threshold for an absolute majority in the 577-seat lower chamber, the National Assembly. Macron\u2019s party is already governing without a majority after its poorer-than-expected showing in the 2022 legislative elections, forcing it to either seek out coalitions to pass legislation or use a constitutional tool to force through new laws \u2013 including last year\u2019s controversial pension reform that raised the retirement age to 64 for most workers \u2013 without a vote. But falling behind to either the left or right could be the death knell to his agenda. A loss would force Macron to nominate a prime minister from whichever party wins \u2013 putting a political opponent in charge of running the government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/france-debate-attal-bardella-bompard-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_sport_soccer-player-workload-event-fifpro-pfa-spt-intl", "text": "Just how much soccer is too much soccer? It\u2019s a question on the lips of players, managers and executives alike, as the sport comes to terms with a seemingly never-ending schedule. For those affected, frustration with the game\u2019s governing bodies over a lack of consideration and an arduous calendar is reaching a boiling point. Representatives from players\u2019 unions and professional leagues made this clear on May 30 at the annual Player Workload event in London, which was organized by FIFPRO (the global representative association for footballers) and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA), the trade union for players in England and Wales. \u201cI think we are worried that that people make decisions in isolation and without seeing the big picture,\u201d the CEO of the PFA, Maheta Molango, told CNN Sport at the event. \u201cEveryone says to you, \u2018my calendar works.\u2019 Yeah, of course it does. But then when you look at this in conjunction then it doesn\u2019t. \u201cWe live right now in an industry where the people who are supposed to be the parents of football have gone down to the level of the kids to fight for the same toys.\u201d \u2018An industry-wide issue\u2019 European club teams are preparing for a revamped UEFA Champions League \u2013 the most prestigious competition in European club soccer \u2013 which will see teams play at least an additional two games. In a departure from the well-established six-game group stage format, clubs will now play eight fixtures in a single 36-team league. The top eight teams will automatically advance to the round of 16, while clubs that place ninth down to 24th will compete in a two-legged play-off to determine the other eight teams that move on. This means that 16 clubs will play a minimum of 10 matches Champions League matches per season, all before even advancing to the knockout stage. On the international level, the European Championships expanded from 16 teams to 24 in 2016, while the 2026 World Cup \u2013 which will be hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico \u2013 will go from 32 to 48 sides. Clubs are also coming to terms with a revamped FIFA Club World Cup competition, which normally takes place annually and has seven teams from each continental federation battling for the trophy. The tournament will now take place every four years and expand to 32 teams, who will compete over a whole month during the summer. \u201cAre they going to come up with an inter-galactic competition next?!\u201d said La Liga President Javier Tebas during a panel session at the London event. According to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who is FIFA\u2019s\u00a0Chief of Global Football Development,  staging the Club World Cup every four years will have a \u201cpositive impact.\u201d \u201cIt will increase resources for clubs all over the world to develop and to compete,\u201d said Wenger. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we make football really global and this creates a chance for other clubs to progress, this is the real target.\u00a0It will give more opportunities to more players all over the world to compete at the highest level. I feel there is a huge expectation from football fans to see their clubs compete on the world stage, added Wenger. However, tor the unions, this overhaul was a step too far. FIFPRO Europe made a legal claim against FIFA on June 13, \u201cchallenging the legality of FIFA\u2019s decisions to unilaterally set the International Match Calendar and, in particular, the decision to create and schedule the FIFA Club World Cup 2025.\u201d The PFA, the French players\u2019 union \u2013- the Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionnels (UNFP) \u2013 and the Italian union, Associazione Italiana Calciatori (AIC), have all joined the case against FIFA as co-claimants Molango described the 2025 Club World Cup as \u201cthe tipping point\u201d and explained that action had been taken to bring about the \u201cright level\u201d of consultation with the unions and players and to tackle a \u201cphysically impossible\u201d calendar. It is unclear whether the tournament will be able to go ahead while the legal claim is ongoing. Molango also told CNN that the Club World Cup is not being looked at in isolation and that the Super League ruling in December opened the door to \u201csolving issues through collective bargaining.\u201d Consequences of congestion According to research conducted by FIFPRO and Football Benchmark, 23 year-old Real Madrid and Brazil superstar Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior has played more than double the amount of matches that his compatriot and former Ballon d\u2019Or winner Ronaldinho played before turning 24. He is set to represent his nation at the Copa Am\u00e9rica this summer. Ahead of the Champions League final on June 1, Vin\u00edcius\u2019 Madrid teammate Jude Bellingham had played 18,486 minutes in his young career, spread across club and international competition. In comparison, England and Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney \u2013 who, like Bellingham, became a first team regular at the age of 16 \u2013 played 15,481 minutes before turning 21. David Beckham played almost five times less the number of minutes that Bellingham has by the same age. \u201cExtreme\u201d calendar congestion is reaching an unsustainable point, according to FIFPRO. Takumi Minamino playing for Japan at the 2024 Asian Cup in Qatar before flying back to Europe to come on as a substitute for French league side AS Monaco less than 24 hours later was cited as an example. Insufficient recovery time can lead to an increased risk of injury for players \u2013 which FIFPRO pointed out can have economic consequences as well as sporting ones \u2013 while the travel schedule was also criticized, with leading players racking up tens of thousands of air miles per season, across several different time zones. Sports scientist Simon Brundish told CNN that players need at least five days of rest in between fixtures, which they simply are not getting. Per FIFPRO, superstar forwards Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe played more than 70% of their matches in the 2022/23 season with less than five days recovery time. Brundish explained that footballers ideally should play a maximum of 3,800 minutes per season, equivalent to around 42 90-minute games. He suggested that extending the calendar to allow for more rest or bringing in a sports science-supported hard cap on the amount of minutes that players are allowed to play is possible in theory, but both measures are highly unlikely to be introduced due to logistical and sporting complications. Conflict between national teams and clubs over minutes could arise, star players could see the field less and league structures would have to change. \u201cThere are too many stakeholders with their own self-interest,\u201d Brundish said. There is also concern around the mental health of players. The 2022 World Cup in Qatar took place in the middle of the European club season, rather than in the summer months as is typical. Over 40% of World Cup players surveyed by Football Benchmark said that they experienced extreme or increased mental fatigue after the tournament. \u201cA failure of governance\u201d \u201cTo listen is to accept your responsibility, and FIFA doesn\u2019t listen\u2026they make unilateral decisions and it is a failure of governance,\u201d said FIFPRO Europe President David Terrier, who described the situation as an \u201cemergency.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, the authorities, sometimes even national authorities, have an interesting concept of consultation,\u201d Molango told CNN. \u201cFor us, consultation doesn\u2019t mean; coming up with a crazy idea, informing you about the crazy idea, and after a few complaints saying, \u2018well, you know, I\u2019m gonna tweak it and be less crazy, but still crazy, and just crack on.\u2019 That\u2019s not consultation.\u201d He also pointed towards the fact that league executives and players\u2019 representatives were in the same room, arguing for the same cause at the event. \u201cThe calendar is becoming less harmonious,\u201d added Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters. \u201cIn life, if you feel as though you\u2019re listened to, you start to get frustrated. If you\u2019re then still not listened to, you start to get angry \u2026 we have not been properly consulted.\u201d However, in a letter seen by CNN that FIFA sent to FIFPRO and the World Leagues Association in May, soccer\u2019s world governing body said that the \u201csubject of the calendar was discussed with both FIFPRO and the World Leagues Forum, among others, on several occasions as a fundamental part of the wider topic of the \u2018Future of Football\u2019 during 2021 and into 2022.\u201d When contacted by CNN for a response to the comments made at the event, UEFA said that it \u201cworks in cooperation with its stakeholders with regards to formats and has thorough consultation processes in place.\u201d \u201cCalendar saturation is an issue in modern football, although the distribution of workload is very uneven between leagues and clubs,\u201d it added. \u201cWe will continue to collaborate with all stakeholders to ensure calendar fairness and players\u2019 welfare.\u201d Finding a balance Some argue that soccer players are paid huge salaries \u2013 according to Inter Miami part-owner Jorge Mas, Lionel Messi is earning between $50 to 60 million at the club \u2013 and that should soften the blow of an increased workload. Brundish was quick to point out that players\u2019 salaries have no impact on what they can take on physically. Instead, it\u2019s the calendar and consultation process that need to change for those in the game. The idea that players are humans before they are footballers, was promoted at the event. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t treat racehorses like this,\u201d said renowned soccer journalist Henry Winter at the London event. \u201cIf we told racehorses that they would have to race every three days, there would be protests.\u201d Winter suggested that players could take the unprecedented action of going on strike if the situation does not improve. However, Wenger said the welfare of players in the last 20 years has\u201d increased dramatically,\u201d thanks to injury prevention, recovery work, nutrition and advances in medical technology. \u201cWe see players receiving world awards, the likes of Messi, Ronaldo, Benzema, all over the age of 35,\u201d added FIFA\u2019s\u00a0Chief of Global Football Development. \u201cAnd it is not unusual to see international careers lasting over 20 years. Not so long ago, that was not possible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/sport/soccer-player-workload-event-fifpro-pfa-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

From then on, we have been in constant contact with Steven, who has now been fully reintegrated into the Dutch volleyball community,\u201d Everaert added in the statement. Van de Velde served some of his sentence in England before being transferred to the Netherlands, where he was released and returned to playing in 2017, according to Nevobo. In 2018, van de Velde told national broadcaster NOS: \u201cI did what I did. I can\u2019t take it back, so I will have to carry the consequences. You can judge, of course. It is the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d \u201cHe is proving to be an exemplary professional and human being and there has been no reason to doubt him since his return,\u201d added Everaert. The federation noted that van de Velde was aware this \u201cblack period in his life\u201d would resurface \u201cbut is obviously not happy about it.\u201d In the statement released by Nevobo, van de Velde said he is grateful for the chance. \u201cI understand that in the run-up to the biggest sporting event in the world, this can attract the attention of international media,\u201d added van de Velde. \u201cBecause of the second chance I got from my parents, my friends, acquaintances and colleagues, who accepted me again after the biggest misstep of my then young life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am also grateful to the Dutch volleyball federation, because they offered me, with clear conditions and agreements, a future in this beautiful sport again. But I also think back to the teenager I was, who was insecure, not ready for a life as a top class athlete and unhappy inside, because I didn\u2019t know who I was and what I wanted.\u201d Nevobo and the Dutch NOC said in a statement that they supported van de Velde, adding that they, along with the FIVB, had consulted experts who considered his chance of recidivism \u201cnil.\u201d \u201cAfter his conviction and sentence, Steven van de Velde returned to the highest level of sport step-by-step under the expert guidance of probation and coaching, among others. He has been participating in international tournaments again since 2017,\u201d Nevobo said in a statement. The Dutch NOC added that van de Velde returned to professional sport on the basis of its guidelines, \u201cwhich sets out, among other things, the conditions under which athletes in top-level sports can return after a conviction.\u201d \u201cVan de Velde now meets all the qualification requirements for the Olympic Games and is therefore part of the team,\u201d the committee added. The International Olympic Committee told CNN that the \u201cnomination of individual team members, following qualification on the field of play, is the sole responsibility of each respective National Olympic Committee. Therefore, we would refer to the Dutch NOC for any further information.\u201d Ju\u2019Riese Colon, CEO for the US Center for SafeSport said in a statement sent to CNN that the organization was \u201cdeeply concerned that anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a minor could participate in the 2024 Olympic Games.\u201d \u201cWith teams from around the world about to convene in Paris, many of which include minor athletes, this sends a dangerous message that medals and money mean more than their safety. Participation in sport is a privilege not a right,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/sport/steven-van-de-velde-olympics-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_sport_andy-murray-wimbledon-retirement-plan-spt-intl", "text": "After undergoing surgery for a spinal cyst on Saturday, three-time grand slam champion Andy Murray says he will wait until the last moment before deciding whether to play at Wimbledon this year \u2013 and gave an update on his retirement plans. The 37-year-old was forced to retire from his match last week at the Queen\u2019s Club Championships in London because of the back injury but is still set to appear in the draw for this year\u2019s Wimbledon which starts July 1. If Murray is unable to play singles, h\ufeffe may still participate in the men\u2019s doubles alongside his brother Jamie. The doubles tournament is due to start later in Wimbledon\u2019s schedule. \u201cThe rate that I\u2019m improving just now, if that was to continue then an extra 72 to 96 hours makes a huge difference,\u201d Murray said Thursday, according to Wimbledon, adding that he\u2019s doing rehab around the clock in an effort to be fit. \u201cI\u2019m going to wait until the last minute to see if I\u2019m going to be able to and I\u2019ve earned that right to do that. \u201cThis is not clear cut whether I am 100% going to be ready to play or there is a 0% chance that I can play. That is the situation. I would say it\u2019s probably more likely that I\u2019m not able to play singles right now. \u201cMaybe this is just how it was meant to happen for me,\u201d Murray added. \u201cGetting to play with Jamie in the doubles is something that obviously I have never done before [at Wimbledon]. That can be special as well.\u201d Looking beyond Wimbledon, Murray is planning his retirement from the sport and says the Olympic Games in Paris could well be his last tournament. He said that he wants to \u201cgo out playing a proper match\u201d and wouldn\u2019t rule out participating at other tournaments this season if he was unable to be competitive at Wimbledon and the Olympics. However, he said he has no plans to compete at the US Open in New York, the final major of the year. \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure that if I wasn\u2019t able to play at Wimbledon, and I didn\u2019t recover in time to play at the Olympics that I wouldn\u2019t consider trying to play another tournament somewhere,\u201d Murray said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m able to play at Wimbledon and if I\u2019m able to play at the Olympics, that\u2019s most likely going to be it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/sport/andy-murray-wimbledon-retirement-plan-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_paris-catacombs-eiffel-tower-apartment", "text": "Charming. Historic. Romantic. Paris\u2019s allure remains undimmed. The City of Light is a shining beacon, welcoming in visitors from all over the world keen to indulge in a spot of joie de vivre.  For two years running, it has topped Euromonitor International\u2019s poll of the world\u2019s most attractive cities, winning out when it comes to tourism, sustainability, economic performance and health and safety. All of this will be on show when Paris hosts the 2024 Olympics and Paralympics in July and August, 100 years since the last time the Games were held on French soil. Enduring sites and streets of unrivaled beauty continue to make it such a big draw. From the traffic braving the Arc De Triomphe to the scene-stealing Eiffel Tower, via the ghoulish Catacombs and the resurgent majesty of Notre Dame, Paris is a place where dreamers and history lovers will always feel at home. Rising from the ashes It\u2019s at Notre Dame where Paris\u2019s past and present meet. Work began on arguably the world\u2019s most iconic cathedral in 1163, its position on the banks of the Seine making it one of the city\u2019s most striking landmarks. It bore witness to the French Revolution, Napoleon\u2019s coronation as Emperor of France and two world wars. But in April 2019, it suffered a devastating fire during a planned restoration, the blaze destroying the wooden ceiling and sending its spire tumbling into the cathedral\u2019s nave. Remarkably, the grand fa\u00e7ade, the organ, all the stained glass windows and works of art were only slightly damaged and remained intact. But in December 2024, Notre Dame will open its doors once more, with work that many predicted would take 20 years completed in just five. Two thousand sculptors, stone masons, carpenters and artists were drafted in, their expertise ensuring that the restoration has left the cathedral looking virtually identical to how it did before the fire. Philippe Jost took over as president of the restoration in 2023 and says the wooden ceiling presented the biggest challenge. \u201cThe oak structure, known as \u2018La Floret,\u2019 burned to the ground. It is now rebuilt. We searched for thousands of oak trees in the forests of France,\u201d he says. Jost adds that there was nothing that the team could not restore. \u201cYou cannot identify what has been rebuilt, because it\u2019s the same stone and type of work. It\u2019s the respect we owe the monument.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re at 85% or 90%,\u201d he says when asked about how close he and his team are to completion. The work here is utterly incredible, a testament to the fact that such craftsmanship still exists in the 21st century. The naked columns of the cathedral soar up to the ceiling; the walls, stripped of centuries of dust and grime, appear brand new. The cost of the fire hasn\u2019t just been financial. The careful cleaning and restoration \u2013 ensuring the health of the building for perhaps centuries to come \u2013 has stolen some of the mystical gloom and charm that visitors will remember, but that\u2019s a small price to pay for bringing such an important building back from the brink. A deathly detour Paris\u2019s past isn\u2019t just visible at street level, however. Walk into an unremarkable building in the Montparnasse district and take the stairs below ground and you\u2019ll find a very real reminder of the people who once called this city home: the Paris Catacombs. Six million souls lie buried here, in what is thought to be one of the world\u2019s largest mass graves. \u201cThese are all the people who lived in Paris for the past 10 centuries,\u201d says our guide as we walk past rows of skulls and bones, neatly arranged into the walls of these one-time limestone quarries. In the late 18th century, Paris faced a grim reality: overflowing cemeteries posed a dire health threat to its inhabitants. The solution was to take the bodies from these former resting places and move them into a dedicated ossuary housed within the city\u2019s extensive underground limestone quarries. The catacombs themselves occupy just a small fraction of the 300 kilometers of quarries that form an intricate network beneath Paris\u2019s streets. So vast are they that whole communities are said to live within them, with literal underground raves a cornerstone of the city\u2019s alternative party scene. The sheer number of human remains here cannot help but cause deep contemplation. \u201cThis whole theatricality is efficient because everyone who does the tour at some point thinks about his or her own death,\u201d says our guide. \u201cThinking \u2018Yeah, me too one day!\u201d Yes you can can While the dead make for a somewhat morbid distraction, there is something a lot more lively on Boulevard de Clichy, in a place that has been serving up a good time since 1889. The Moulin Rouge. The birthplace of the high-kicking can-can dance, it pioneered a new form of cabaret when it opened in the late 19th century, starting a craze that endured for the best part of 100 years. It was also a byword for the Belle Epoque period, when prosperity and progress pointed towards a better world. Today, it remains every bit as iconic (apart from the occasional mishap), its dancers dressed in stunning costumes that make their moves even more impressive. \u201cWhen you first start wearing it, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s easy, but I\u2019ve been dancing here now for six years so I feel like it\u2019s a part of me,\u201d says Jasmine, one of the dancers who dons these amazing outfits twice a night, every night. Each one is hand-made and tailored to the dancers, with more than three kilometers of the finest ostrich feathers used each year for these creations. They are meticulously crafted by Maxime Leroy and his team at Maison Fevrier \u2013 a prestigious feather atelier that\u2019s been in the game for nearly a century. They need to strike a tricky balance, being heavy without weighing down the dancers when they take to the stage and perform their famous kicks. \u201cIt\u2019s all about how you finish,\u201d says Jasmine when revealing how to can-can properly, explaining that you need to stand up straight and aim for a classic kick with a straight leg. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds and even harder to do. It\u2019s why, perhaps, the Moulin Rouge endures to this day. A foodie paradise The French aren\u2019t known for their patience, but when it comes to food, they take their time. Like waiting in line, no matter how long, for their morning baguette. Modern technology has streamlined many aspects of bread production. Yet in Paris, there\u2019s still a strong tradition of artisanal craftsmanship and patrons are willing to pay a bit more for it. In fact, in 2022 UNESCO added the French baguette to its list of cultural heritage items, recognizing its significance and importance to the French way of life. And while baking your own is unlikely to match up to one you buy, you can at least have a go at that other Parisian staple, the omelet. And no one knows how to make one better than chef Yannick Alleno. With 16 Michelin stars under his belt, he knows what he\u2019s talking about. In fact, he says that when training new chefs, an omelet is the best dish for them to start with. \u201cYou have to tell them to make an omelet,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the most difficult thing to realize. Because you\u2019re using two hands. You move the pan and you have to look and control the fire under. Cooking is a dance with the fire. You should know how to dance with the fire. The omelet is the perfect thing for that.\u201d Alleno\u2019s method requires four eggs, milk and a grinding of pepper, before cooking over a high heat, rolling the pan as you go to ensure it\u2019s properly cooked but never hard on the edges. \u201cBecause we are in France\u2026pepper (in the mix), butter on the top. That\u2019s what I like,\u201d grins Alleno as he works his magic. It might seem a simple dish, but eat an omelet in Paris and you\u2019ll leave dreaming of making your own in the same way. The Eiffel Tower\u2019s little-known apartment Of course, no trip to Paris would be complete without taking the time to scale the Eiffel Tower. The city\u2019s tallest building and its most iconic site, it is the symbol not just of Paris, but of France too. And few people know as much about it as tour guide Jose Ruiz Cobo. Cobo is an Eiffel Tower veteran, having worked here for 21 years, but says he never tires of climbing this most incredible of buildings. \u201cEspecially this early when there\u2019s no one here and you can really enjoy the view,\u201d he says as we head towards the top at the start of the day. For Cobo though, the public viewing area at the top isn\u2019t the most special part of the Eiffel Tower. Instead, it\u2019s the private apartment of Gustav Eiffel, the engineer who came up with this amazing structure. Found at the tip of the tower, this small space is stuffed full of history, a place for its creator to contemplate his greatest achievement, a building meant to stand for just 20 years after its construction for the 1889 World Exhibition. The 100-meter square apartment was slimmed down to make way for public restrooms, but remains as magical as you would imagine. And despite countless offers, Eiffel refused to allow tenants to take up residence. \u201cThey offered huge sums of money to rent it for a night,\u201d says Cobo. \u201cBut he was so obsessed with science that he refused. He would only bring family, friends and scientists. The most famous guest is probably\u2026 Thomas Albert Edison who brought his recording device.\u201d It\u2019s part of the Eiffel Tower that few realize is here. Not that the view alone isn\u2019t reason enough to queue for hours on end, of course. It\u2019s undoubtedly the best way to see all of Paris, a city that\u2019s impossible not to love. The views in all directions are quite magnificent, imbuing visitors with the urge to see and experience as much of it before they have to depart.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

{"id": "2024_06_25_africa_kenya-protests-tax-rises-intl", "text": "Kenyan President William Ruto denounced protests on Tuesday that saw parliament stormed and at least five people shot dead as \u201ctreasonous\u201d \u2013 but did not address the swelling outrage against a controversial finance bill that\u00a0sparked the widespread demonstrations. Kenya is in the grip of nationwide protests against proposed tax hikes, culminating in Tuesday\u2019s \u201ctotal shutdown\u201d of the country, which quickly turned violent as police used tear gas and live rounds on protesters. The controversial finance bill has unleashed widespread protests movement vowing for \u201c7 Days of Rage.\u201d Last week, the government scrapped some tax increases, including a proposed 16% value-added tax on bread along with taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil and mobile money transfers. But the concessions have not been enough to quell protests amid the rising cost of living. A CNN team saw\u00a0two bodies lying motionless on the ground in Nairobi as the country\u2019s parliament was breached. Kenyan police were also seen beating and later arresting\u00a0some paramedics\u00a0who were helping injured protesters. During a nationwide address after parliament was set alight, Ruto said the events on Tuesday were a grave threat to \u201cnational security\u201d and that the conversation around the bill had been \u201chijacked by dangerous people.\u201d \u201cIt is not in order, or even conceivable, that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives, and the institutions established under our Constitution and expect to go scot-free,\u201d the president said, adding that democratic expression and crime must be isolated from one another. Kenya\u2019s defense ministry said the military has been deployed to support the country\u2019s police services as human rights and civil society groups criticize the heavy-handed response by the police on Tuesday. It was reported that at least five people were shot dead and around 31 were injured during Tuesday\u2019s protests. Of these, 13 were hit with live bullets, four with rubber bullets, and three with launcher canisters, according to a joint statement by Amnesty International Kenya, the Kenya Medical Association, the Law Society of Kenya, and Police Reforms Working Group Kenya. The joint statement also accused the police of shooting at a medical emergency center located at a church. CNN has reached out to the\u00a0Kenyan police for comment. \u201cThe use of live bullets must now stop,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDespite the assurance by the government that the right to assembly would be protected and facilitated, today\u2019s protests have spiraled into violence. Human rights observers and medical officers have reported several incidents of human rights violation.\u201d The demonstrations, sparked by the Finance Bill 2024, have seen citizens rally under the banner of \u201c7 Days of Rage,\u201d as the nation faces more days of upheaval. The dramatic scenes that unfolded in the nation\u2019s capital saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from Parliament in the melee.  Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from Parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported. Internet monitoring site\u00a0NetBlocks reported a \u201cmajor disruption\u201d to internet connectivity Tuesday. Nairobi\u2019s City Hall, the office of the Governor of Nairobi, was also set on fire, live visuals from CNN affiliate Citizen TV showed. A fire could be seen blazing through a lower-ground window, with other windows also emitting smoke. According to Citizen TV, some people were seen removing furniture, including chairs, from the building. Vehicles parked at Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court, which is close to the City Hall, were also set on fire. Earlier on Tuesday, Auma Obama, the half-sister of former United States President Barack Obama, was teargassed by police during an interview with CNN live on air, while protesting\u00a0against the bill. \u201cI can\u2019t even see anymore, we\u2019re being teargassed,\u201d Obama said in dramatic footage captured by a CNN team on the ground. Obama, a\u00a0Kenyan-British activist, was speaking to CNN alongside a group of young protesters when the group was teargassed in Nairobi. A spokesman for former President Obama declined to comment on the tear gas incident on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m here because look at what\u2019s happening. Young\u00a0Kenyans are demonstrating for their rights. They are demonstrating with flags and banners,\u201d Obama said. Accusations of abductions Security forces have also been accused of abducting prominent Kenyans, particularly those who have large social media followings Amnesty International\u00a0Kenya\u00a0says it is investigating the whereabouts of up to 12 people who were \u201cabducted in the middle of night\u201d ahead of Tuesday\u2019s planned protests. The list includes bloggers, content creators, human rights defenders, a doctor, and a parliamentary staffer, Amnesty\u00a0Kenya\u00a0executive director Ir\u0169ng\u0169 Houghton told CNN. \u201cWe are horrified by some of the testimonies we have heard over the last 24 hours. We have about 12 people unaccounted for who have been picked up, in many cases, by people who are uniformed or not uniformed,\u201d Houghton said, adding that that they had not received legal assistance and their families didn\u2019t know their whereabouts. \u201cWe are now seeing not just abductions but disappearances,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to the Kenyan police for comment.

{"id": "2024_04_27_europe_julian-assange-profile-intl-cmd", "text": "Julian Assange\u00a0started his WikiLeaks whistleblowing website on a quest for \u201cradical transparency and truth,\u201d a mission that turned an already polarizing personality into a notorious character and\u00a0earned him\u00a0crusaders and critics\u00a0in equal measure. His\u00a0long-running battle against extradition to the United States had been making its way through UK courts for years until a remarkable plea deal on Monday. Assange, 52, left the UK after agreeing to plead guilty to a single felony charge in exchange for time served. The deal was finalized in a remote US court in the Pacific on Wednesday morning, after which he is expected to return to his native Australia. It has been 12 years since Assange was a free man. He spent the past five years in London\u2019s high-security Belmarsh prison and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in the English capital,\u00a0trying to avoid arrest. He was facing life imprisonment in the US for publishing hundreds of thousands of sensitive military and government documents supplied by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning more than a dozen years ago. But recently there has been increased pressure for a resolution to Assange\u2019s case. In April, US President Joe Biden offered\u00a0Assange\u2019s supporters a glimmer of hope saying his administration was\u00a0\u201cconsidering\u201d a request from Australia\u00a0to drop its charges against the WikiLeaks founder. The remarks were described as an \u201cencouraging\u201d signal by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who added that Assange had \u201calready paid a significant price\u201d and \u201cenough is enough.\u201d The ascent of Assange Born in Townsville, eastern Queensland, in 1971, Assange had a less than conventional upbringing. His education was a combination of home schooling and correspondence courses, since his family moved frequently. In his teens, he discovered a natural proficiency for computing, but his activities \u2013 which included accessing several secure systems, including the Pentagon and NASA, under the hacker alias \u201cMendax\u201d \u2013 soon put him on the radar of authorities. In 1991, he was charged with 31 counts of cybercrime by Australian authorities but only received a small fine at sentencing after pleading guilty to most of the charges. Following his brush with the law, Assange worked as a computer security consultant, traveled and briefly studied physics at the University of Melbourne before withdrawing from the course. His vision when starting WikiLeaks in 2006 was that it would be a kind of online repository, which would publish anonymously submitted documents, video and other sensitive materials after vetting them. It ran for several years, uploading material ranging from the US military\u2019s operating manual for its detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to internal documents from the Church of Scientology and some of 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin\u2019s stolen emails. But it was catapulted to global attention in 2010 with a video that later became known as \u201cCollateral Murder.\u201d Back then, journalist Atika Shubert caught wind of footage circulating which claimed to show a deadly 2007 US helicopter attack in Iraq. Then a reporter for CNN in London, Shubert tracked down the individual in possession of the footage. On first impressions, Assange was \u201cvague\u201d and \u201celusive,\u201d Shubert recalled. With the benefit of hindsight, she now believes his behavior was the result of \u201csitting on this cache of documents from Chelsea Manning and trying to figure out how to publish it.\u201d He showed up unannounced at CNN\u2019s London office soon after, a USB stick with thousands of classified documents in the palm of his hand. \u201cThat was my first introduction to the world of data dumps and what exactly WikiLeaks was doing - the scale of it - which I had never heard of before,\u201d Shubert said. WikiLeaks ultimately released the video from the US helicopter attack in Iraq, sparking condemnation from human rights activists and earning rebuke from US defense officials. By the year\u2019s end, the organization had gone on to publish nearly half a million classified documents relating to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under a global spotlight As WikiLeaks continued its disclosures, Assange found himself the latest cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre \u2013 his every movement intensely scrutinized. And with each headline, his infamy grew among those who did not share his vision. Fidel Narvaez, former consul of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, met Assange in 2011, after WikiLeaks released another huge archive \u2013 this time of secret US diplomatic cables. The pair became close friends through the years. \u201cAssange can be stubborn, sometimes he can clash with other people, but once you know him \u2026 he is extremely respectful and warm. He has a great sense of humor,\u201d Narvaez told CNN. \u201cHis one mission in life is publishing, which is what he has done with WikiLeaks.\u201d Assange\u2019s story, as the \u201cteen hacker who became insurgent in information war\u201d as the Guardian put it in 2011, sounded like the plot of a Hollywood blockbuster. Soon his tale was immortalized in documentaries and films, perhaps most notably in 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Fifth Estate,\u201d which Assange labeled a \u201cgeriatric snoozefest\u201d that used what he considered flawed source material. For journalist and author James Ball, who briefly worked at WikiLeaks and was based for a time at Ellingham Hall, a remote manor house north of London where Assange holed up before seeking refuge in Ecuador\u2019s embassy, the infancy of WikiLeaks was an \u201cexhilarating\u201d time. \u201cYou were working on the kind of material that we (had) really never seen before. Leaks have become a bit more common since, but the idea that you could peruse through these huge sets of records that showed what happened in conflicts or what actually happened in closed rooms, was sort of completely new,\u201d Ball told CNN. WikiLeaks became a household name thanks to its frequent data dumps, but some were starting to question the founder\u2019s behavior. For many, his polarizing personality became an issue. Ball added: \u201cHe sort of liked the attention. \u2026 He liked the fuss that (the disclosures) caused but he was oddly incurious actually about the documents.\u201d Others offer alternative explanations for Assange\u2019s eccentricities. Narvaez said the Assange he knew was \u201chyperactive and workaholic\u201d and pointed to his diagnosed autism spectrum disorder as an element of his personality. Shifting attitudes Such questions aside, WikiLeaks essentially ground to a halt when Assange was accused of sexual assault in Sweden in August 2010. The organization\u2019s focus shifted from offense to defense, despite the transparency campaigner\u2019s vehement denial of the allegations against him. There were mounting calls for Assange to leave WikiLeaks and, when he didn\u2019t, many cut ties with it. Assange labeled it \u201ca smear campaign\u201d orchestrated to pave the way for his further extradition to the US and refused to go to Sweden for questioning. In June 2012, while out on bail from UK officials over the Swedish probe, he opted for a nuclear option and knocked on the door at 3 Hans Crescent, where he requested political asylum from Ecuador. Outside the confines of his diplomatic shelter, the world questioned whether Assange was trying to circumvent justice. Over time, his relationship with his host soured along with the arrival of a new president in Ecuador in 2017. Assange was \u201can inherited problem\u201d for Lenin Moreno, who was facing pressure from the US to expel him from the diplomatic bolthole. \u201cIt was obvious that former President Moreno was going to give in to external and internal pressure,\u201d Narvaez said. Narvaez, seen as too close to the unwanted houseguest, was asked to leave in July 2018 amid a shake-up of the diplomatic mission\u2019s staff. \u201cI left him isolated, and I was the last person he trusted,\u201d Narvaez said. Nine months later, in April 2019, Assange was pulled kicking and screaming from the building by London\u2019s Metropolitan Police on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department. Legal limbo Once in British custody, Assange had lived, mostly isolated, in a three-by-two-meter cell at Belmarsh prison in southeast London. The prison has the capacity to hold over 900 inmates and is known for once housing infamous terror suspects such as\u00a0Abu Hamza al-Masri\u00a0within its high-security unit. The US accused Assange of endangering lives by publishing secret military documents in 2010 and 2011. He was wanted on 18 criminal charges relating to his organization\u2019s dissemination of classified material and diplomatic cables and faced up to 175 years in prison conditions much harsher than here in the UK. Fighting his corner since he entered Belmarsh: his wife, Stella Assange. The couple married in March 2022, while he was in prison. Stella, the mother of Assange\u2019s two young sons, called her husband a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d outside court in March and has repeatedly voiced her fear that, if extradited, he could take his own life. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about how he\u2019s doing. Physically, he\u2019s aged prematurely,\u201d she previously told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s on medication. As you know, in October 2021, he had a mini-stroke and he has all sorts of health problems.\u201d She had labeled the US\u2019 latest guarantees that Assange could lean on First Amendment protections at trial\u00a0\u201cblatant weasel words\u201d in a statement on April 16. \u201cThe diplomatic note does nothing to relieve our family\u2019s extreme distress about his future \u2013 his grim expectation of spending the rest of his life in isolation in US prison for publishing award-winning journalism,\u201d she said. Nick Vamos, head of business crime at Peters & Peters law firm and a former head of extradition at the UK\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service, told CNN that on the other side of the coin, some might suggest that \u201cyou should allow the judicial system to follow through to its conclusion\u201d without being influenced by protests from supporters. Assange\u2019s team had argued his potential extradition was for political reasons and that a handover to the US violated the European Convention on Human Rights. It was a claim supported by independent experts. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Jill Edwards, in February called on the British government to halt a possible extradition and reiterated her concerns about Assange\u2019s fitness and \u201cthe potential for him to receive a wholly disproportionate sentence in the United States.\u201d Marking Assange\u2019s five years at Belmarsh, Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General Agn\u00e8s Callamard had warned that Assange, if extradited, would \u201cbe at risk of serious abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, which would violate the prohibition on torture or other ill-treatment.\u201d She added that US assurances over his treatment could not be relied upon as they are \u201criddled with loopholes.\u201d Far-reaching repercussions Beyond the personal costs for Assange, many had expressed concern about the broader implications for press freedom around the world if he had been sent to the US. Five international media organizations that collaborated with Assange previously called the US government to end its prosecution of him for publishing classified material. In a 2022 letter, representatives for The New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds and Der Spiegel argued publishing is not a crime. \u201cObtaining and disclosing sensitive information when necessary in the public interest is a core part of the daily work of journalists. If that work is criminalised, our public discourse and our democracies are made significantly weaker,\u201d the letter stated. Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the plea deal averted \u201cthe worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day. He continued, \u201cIt will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.\u201d Likewise, former Guardian editor and collaborator Alan Rusbridger wrote on X that while it was \u201cgood news that Assange is apparently free,\u201d he expressed concern at the repercussions of his years-long legal battle. \u201cHis treatment was a warning to journalists and whistleblowers to keep quiet in future,\u201d he added. And I suspect it will have worked.\u201d This story has been updated with latest developments following Assange\u2019s US plea deal.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "travel_the-end-of-off-season-travel-cmb", "text": "It might be an impossible task to find a traveler who loves crowds and long lines. However, they\u2019re part of the price that most tourists have to pay to visit some of the world\u2019s most famous attractions, especially during peak times. It used to be that someone looking for a bargain could count on traveling in the shoulder or low season \u2013 for example, Italy was once more affordable in the fall, while Hong Kong was cheaper in the boiling-hot summer months. But the pandemic threw a lot of this conventional travel wisdom out the window. Many offices and schools switched to online-only, which provided people a rare opportunity to spend long periods away from home. Some companies kept those remote working policies after the pandemic ended, providing their workers with more opportunities to explore the world while still drawing a paycheck. All that tourism, though, comes with consequences. Practically every day there\u2019s a new headline about efforts to combat overtourism, such as new hotel bans in Amsterdam, photo-blocking barricades in Japan and mass protests in the Canary Islands. According to the United Nations, global travel  will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024 \u2013 and could go higher. That, in turn, begs a question: Is there such a thing as an off-season anymore? \u201cOn the one hand, global travel is getting busier and busier,\u201d explains Olivier Ponti, a director at ForwardKeys, a Spain-based travel data and analysis company. \u201cThere are still some peak seasons and those peak seasons remain really busy, but the low seasons are getting busier and busier as well.\u201d Recently, ForwardKeys crunched some numbers in three of the world\u2019s most popular beach destinations: Thailand, Hawaii and the Maldives. Here\u2019s the math: take the total number of tourists in a year and divide that figure by 12, which works out to an average of 8% per month. Then, you can plot a graph to see which months are higher and lower than that total to determine when the peak season is. \u201cIn Thailand, low season typically spans from April to September with April and May being really hot,\u201d says Ponti. \u201cDuring this low season the tourist volumes each month constitute more than 7% of the annual total. That means very, very little seasonality.\u201d In other words? \u201cThere is no off-season anymore in a place like that.\u201d The climate change effect Arguably the biggest single factor affecting what we know as \u201cpeak season\u201d travel is weather. \u201cA lot of people tend to assume that the low season is defined as the time of the year when the weather is the crappiest,\u201d says Ged Brown, owner of the aptly-named tour company Low Season Traveller. But climate change is redefining what that \u201ccrappiest\u201d weather might be. A 2023 survey from the European Travel Commission reported that European travelers cited weather as their number-one factor in deciding where to go on vacation, with 8% of respondents saying they were concerned about extreme weather in European destinations. Heat waves in southern European countries like Italy, Spain and Greece caused a crisis last summer, with the trend only continuing upward. Multiple foreign tourists have gone missing or died amid extreme heat in Greece so far this season. More than 62,000 people died heat-related deaths in Europe in 2022, the continent\u2019s hottest summer on record. Following the devastating headlines, ForwardKeys\u2019 data shows an immediate spike in searches for summertime flights to northern European destinations like Denmark and Sweden. Mikey Sadowski, head of communications at tour organizer Intrepid Travel, says that the company has had to drop or reschedule some of its popular trips due to climate change. In Nepal, he says, there\u2019s an \u201cincrease of the monsoon season now. Snow is melting faster, the glaciers are melting faster, the water is running faster and routes that we normally could access before are no longer accessible. So we\u2019re actually having to shorten the [travel] seasons to avoid heavy monsoon time.\u201d Intrepid\u2019s own CEO canceled an Italian cruise with his mother because of hot weather concerns, Sadowski says. Beyond the thermostat Climate may be an important factor in booking a holiday, but it\u2019s not the only one. ForwardKeys\u2019 Ponti, himself a father of two, notes that many travelers have to plan their trips at the same time because they are working around school schedules. Some families choose to homeschool their children as a way to experience other parts of the world without being beholden to a schedule. The parents who opt to \u201cworldschool\u201d can travel during off-peak times \u2013 while also teaching their kids about different cultures. But every family\u2019s situation is different. For those whose kids are grown and out of the house or who don\u2019t have kids at all, there are more opportunities to be flexible when booking travel. Ann Woodward, a childfree American who has been living in Mexico for the past three years, makes a point of learning school schedules in her area so that she can plan around them. \u201cI am generally trying to not move, to not be on a plane, to not be on a bus, to not go to touristic attractions during those periods. I actually call it hiding,\u201d she laughs. Woodward, who has a pension from her last job in the US, can afford to travel for months at a time, preferring to choose one destination and rent an apartment rather than hop from place to place. For her, it\u2019s not just about saving money \u2013 it\u2019s about knowing her physical and emotional limits. \u201cI think that things that were acceptable and fun, even in my 20s and 30s, I can\u2019t handle anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, part of the past five years, I\u2019ve become much more focused on healing my nervous system. And I will say that I think I ignored it when I was living in New York, to be quite honest. I was ignoring a lot of cues from my body when I was living there when I was younger. So, whereas maybe an average person would be like, \u2018Wow, this park is really busy today,\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s lots of people in my photos,\u2019 I would just get there and turn around and leave. I just won\u2019t even engage.\u201d Still, Woodward acknowledges that she is in a privileged position. She spent much of her youth traveling and has already \u201cchecked off\u201d many of the big bucket list places that attract the most crowds, which means that she can now go to smaller towns and other less busy areas in addition to visiting during off-peak times. However, there are benefits from traveling during high seasons, especially when it comes to infrastructure. Some flights and train routes run more frequently \u2013 or only \u2013 during peak season. Travelers who go to less busy regions may find that shops and restaurants have more limited hours or close entirely when the flocks of visitors leave. Those without flexible schedules shouldn\u2019t feel like their future holds nothing but long, sweltering lines in overcrowded cities. Brown of Low Season Traveller puts together itineraries for adventurous travelers who are looking for a destination their friends haven\u2019t been to already \u2013 or those looking to get a less hectic experience at an old classic. \u201cIf your main purpose for travel is the most perfect weather, then yeah, you\u2019re going to pay a premium for that. And another premium that you\u2019re going to pay is the fact that it\u2019s going to be crowded and you\u2019re going to have to have queues and lines everywhere and find it difficult to get reservations and all of that kind of stuff,\u201d Brown says. \u201cFor me, the challenge is about finding the joy in those low seasons, finding those nuggets of gold.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/the-end-of-off-season-travel-cmb/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

They say they plan to \u201coccupy\u201d parliament in\u00a0Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi. The protest movement has gained significant traction through social media, where organizers have called on all Kenyans to participate in the nationwide strike. \u201cGen Z are granting all hardworking Kenyans a day off,\u201d read a widely circulated poster. The country\u2019s interior minister has warned that demonstrations must end by sunset or 6.30 p.m local time, whichever is earlier.

Kithure did not respond to concerns about a few prominent social media users who have been reported missing in recent days. Recent footage showing a young man being forcibly taken into an SUV has heightened fears and drawn widespread condemnation. The Law Society of\u00a0Kenya\u2019s President, Faith Odhiambo, described the incident as an abduction and accused intelligence officers of misconduct. \u201cEvidently, this was not an arrest as the police did not identify themselves or engage in any conversation prior to the arrest to inform him of his rights,\u201d wrote the president of Law Society of\u00a0Kenya\u00a0Faith Odhiambo in a\u00a0statement. \u201cThese criminals pretending to exercise police authority must be stopped.\u201d CNN has contacted the Kenyan Police Service for comment. The epicenter of the protests is expected to be in Nairobi. Opposition MP Babu Owino,\u00a0in a video posted on X, invited protesters to the National Assembly. \u201cI will personally open the gate for you so you can come in and have tea,\u201d he said. Despite this, the government has warned against attempts to enter any government buildings during the demonstrations. Human rights groups and associations of content creators have expressed fears of potential internet and media blackouts, which could further escalate tensions. In a joint statement, 27 organizations warned that such measures would endanger lives and infringe on citizens\u2019 rights to organize, demonstrate, and participate in policymaking.

{"id": "2024_06_27_style_voice-of-baceprot-vob-indonesia-glastonbury-heavy-metal-intl-hnk", "text": "Thrash metal trio Voice of Baceprot have come a long way since their teen years attending an Islamic school in Indonesia, where they first discovered System of a Down on a teacher\u2019s computer and fell in love with heavy metal music. Earlier this week the band touched down in Britain ahead of their highest profile gig to date, joining the likes of Dua Lipa, Coldplay and Sza to play at the 2024 Glastonbury festival. They will be the first Indonesian band ever to play at the iconic event. Guitarist and vocalist Firda \u201cMarsya\u201d Kurnia said the band was \u201csuper nervous and excited\u201d to bring their brand of Sundanese metal music to a global stage on Friday and told CNN that they were also planning on camping to get into the spirit of the world-renowned event. \u201cWe are here and ready to rock out at Glastonbury,\u201d she said. \u201cOur set is going to be something different and show (the world) Indonesia and Indonesian culture.\u201d Dressed in skinny jeans and headscarves, Marsya and her bandmates drummer Euis Siti Aisyah and bassist Widi Rahmawati are a far cry from the average heavy metal band. But in many ways their embrace of thrash metal \u2013 Baceprot means \u201cloud\u201d in Sundanese \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be surprising. In Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation, metal has long been tremendously popular. \u201cHeavy metal is a way of life in Indonesia and Voice of Baceprot (VOB) has proven against all odds that women too can play and rock out just as hard,\u201d Pri Ario Damar, dean of the performing arts faculty at the Jakarta Institute of Arts \u2013 and a self-professed metalhead \u2013 told CNN. \u201cThey are young, exciting and represent a new brand of Indonesian metal.\u201d While all female fronted acts are a rarity even in the wider, male-dominated world of metal and hardcore, in Indonesia, it\u2019s even rarer to see devout women in hijab moshing out. But VOB do just that. In recent years, the band have morphed from something of a YouTube oddity to a legit act, winning fans like former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello \u2013 who recalled replaying a clip of them \u201cten times in a row\u201d when he first encountered them online. Nobel prize winner Malala Yousafzai has also praised their bravery for enduring death threats and attacks by religious conservatives. \u201cThe members of VOB believe that music is the best way to address the issues they witness in their country and around the world,\u201d her non-profit organization the Malala Fund wrote. \u201cWe don\u2019t want generations after us to remain in the wrong system or way of thinking.\u201d It might sound counterintuitive that a form of music once decried by more fringe Christian conservatives as somehow \u201cSatanic\u201d might be popular in a huge Muslim-majority nation. But in many ways, metal is woven into both the cultural \u2013 and political \u2013 fabric of modern Indonesia. \u201cWe are a moderate Muslim country and are open to (new) arts and culture,\u201d Pri said. \u201cIndonesians love music \u2013 all kinds of genres and sub genres.\u201d Heavy metal music in particular, he added, has always been popular, even among \u201cnew generations of Indonesians today.\u201d Pri recalls the rise of thrash metal while growing up in Jakarta during the 1980s. \u201cIt was all about the \u2018Big Four,\u2019\u201d Pri said, referring to now legendary bands Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax, who he also credits with \u201ctransforming the city\u2019s local music scene.\u201d \u201cJakarta had thriving underground metal and punk scenes. Back then, you would go to pubs and small venues around the city on Saturday nights and hear bands playing Metallica covers,\u201d he recalled. \u201cYou could find bootleg CDs and cassette tapes sold on the streets and radio stations would play heavy metal music all the time.\u201d Globalization and the proliferation of Western acts came at a complicated political time for Indonesia. Indonesia\u2019s first president Sukarno,\u00a0a brutal US-backed dictator who served from 1945 to 1967, famously forbade Western music and bands like the Beatles from being played in the country on the grounds they were products of Western imperialism. \u201cSukarno hated Western influences like rock music, believing it was bad for the country,\u201d according to music and cultural anthropologist Jeremy Wallach, the author of several books about heavy metal in Indonesia. \u201cHe outlawed all kinds of music that did not suit his taste.\u201d His successor Suharto, also a military dictator, began to ease restrictions over his own decades-long rule. \u201cUnbeknownst to him, (it) gave rise to underground music scenes which I believe helped to foster resistance and was partly responsible for toppling his autocratic regime in 1998,\u201d Wallach says. The night Metallica came to town Perhaps the most vivid illustration of how committed Indonesians were to metal took place in April 1993 when Metallica played a set in Jakarta that ended in a historic riot. Pri Ario Damar, the arts dean, was 18 at the time. \u201cMetallica is massive in Indonesia so when they came, it was like a dream,\u201d he recalled. \u201cFans were all super excited and tickets were hard to get.\u201d Pri said minutes into the band\u2019s opening song \u201cCreeping Death,\u201d anger began to spread through crowds of fans locked outside. Frustrated at not being able to afford tickets, they rioted \u2013 smashing stadium gates and torching vehicles and shops. \u201c(So much) violence and noise was happening,\u201d Pri said. \u201cIt was my first encounter with heavy metal.\u201d Metallica were effectively banned from Indonesia for the next 20 years, but they were famously invited back in 2013 by then Jakarta governor \u2013 and self-declared metalhead \u2013 Joko Widodo, who was gifted a bass guitar by Metallica\u2019s Robert Trujillo. \u201cThis time there was no riot,\u201d said Pri, who also attended that second gig. The excitement from the fans was just as raw, he recalled, and this time big screens were set up outside the stadium to accommodate those without tickets. A year later Jokowi, as he is known in Indonesia, was elected president, the country\u2019s first leader not to emerge from its political or military elite. A new era of \u2018Muslim rock chicks\u2019 Indonesia\u2019s love for metal music has given rise to several local festivals that rival popular ones in the West and the country remains a regular stop off point for global touring metal acts. Hammersonic, the largest metal festival in Southeast Asia, has hosted numerous metal and hard rock heavyweights over the years including Megadeth, Slipknot and the Dead Kennedys. This year was headlined by US heavy metal band Lamb of God, and included other well-known international acts such Atreyu, Cradle of Filth, As I Lay Dying and deathcore veterans Suicide Silence, playing to over 30,000 fans, according to organizers. \u201cIndonesia is home to the most metal fans in Asia so heavy metal bands love coming to play here,\u201d said Hammersonic CEO Ravel Junardy. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve built with Hammersonic is a community. We wanted to unite metalheads and rock music fans from all around the world \u2013 like the festivals in places like Sweden and Finland, we thought, why can\u2019t we have metal fests in Indonesia?\u201d Anas Syahrul Alimi, founder of the annual Jogjarockarta music festival held on the island of Java, praised the metal community in Indonesia, saying they were \u201cone of the most diehard heavy metal fanbases in the world \u2013  and also loud as hell.\u201d This year, the festival will be held twice, Anas said, to cater to metalheads from across Indonesia and around the world. \u201cEvery year Jograrockarta is packed with thousands of metalheads and the atmosphere is fantastic,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cDave Mustaine was very excited when he visited our city Yogyakarta for the very first time in 2017,\u201d Anas said of the Megadeth founder, describing him as \u201ca unique and charming rock star.\u201d German thrash metal band Kreator performed at the festival earlier in January under pouring rain. \u201cTheir fans did not budge,\u201d Anas said, adding that they shouted along and moshed all the way until the end of their set. For many metalheads like Dougie, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, metal provides what he says is an outlet for the stresses of everyday life. \u201cWe relate to lyrics that are angry and raw, like songs from bands like Rage Against the Machine, Prong and Soulfly that incorporate social and political messages,\u201d said the aspiring progressive metal guitarist from Surabaya. Mark LeVine, an author of several books about heavy metal communities in the Middle East and Asia, says Indonesia\u2019s metal scene has thrived freely for more than 30 years because the country \u2013 which has long prided itself on being comparatively secular and democratic \u2013 is \u201cso culturally diverse.\u201d \u201cIndonesia has hundreds and hundreds of very different languages and cultures. It is far more tolerantly multicultural than many countries in the Middle East and North Africa,\u201d LeVine told CNN. He also highlighted the persecution of musicians and artists in the Arab world. LeVine says authoritarian governments in places like Egypt might crackdown on metal because they deem it anti-establishment or \u201canti-religious.\u201d \u201cIt can score points because people don\u2019t like metalheads like in Egypt. (But) I don\u2019t think that plays the same way in Indonesia.\u201d Meanwhile as VOB get ready to play Glastonbury, they will not just be playing to foreign fans. Faezah Eli and her friends from Singapore and Malaysia, have bought flights to the United Kingdom and will be in the crowd. She first saw them live at a music festival in Singapore back in 2021 and says she is looking forward to their Glastonbury debut. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see them on stage,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt will be a new era of Muslim rock chicks.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/style/voice-of-baceprot-vob-indonesia-glastonbury-heavy-metal-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "Five Americans have been arrested in Turks and Caicos over the past six months under gun control laws that make bringing firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police a crime. Michael Lee Evans, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, of Oklahoma; and Tyler Wenrich, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. All have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers who went to the British Overseas Territory in May as part of efforts to petition for their expedited release. Though the infractions had carried a mandatory 12-year prison sentence and fine \u2013 with reductions only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2013 a mid-June revision clarified courts may impose a fine, a custodial sentence or both in exceptional circumstances, a member of the territory\u2019s House of Assembly said June 14. Four Americans arrested under the law have pleaded guilty, been sentenced and returned to the US, while the last is due in court next week. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the laws in Turks and Caicos and the affected Americans: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased \u2013 and that\u2019s a worry, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The mandatory sentence was in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. Judges could use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d she said. But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said: \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly.\u201d Even so, the \u201camendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity,\u201d House of Assembly member\u00a0Edwin\u00a0Astwood said in a statement. \u201cThis often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender.\u201d US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick has said, and none got a 12-year sentence. While Turks and Caicos collaborates with the US in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to the United States after he received a suspended 52-week sentence in late May, which meant he didn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He got home May 24, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. Arriving at Pittsburgh International Airport, Hagerich told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife had packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home \u2013 they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark; you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced May 28 to three weeks time-served in jail and fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, a Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands spokesperson said that day in a statement. He returned home to Virginia on May 30. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9 mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. He was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation and to attend his June sentencing hearing virtually, said his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel. Evans got a suspended 33-month sentence, and his attorney believes it is unlikely he will have to serve time in jail. \u201cIf he has no problems in (Turks and Caicos) within 12 months, he will not have to do any time,\u201d Smith told CNN on June 24. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays when he was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. He plead guilty in May. The first of the Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, he got a suspended 13-week sentence and a $2,000 fine, or $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on June 21. Watson soon returned home and reunited with his family, US Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said on X. Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was\u00a0arrested in mid-May and is awaiting trial after making bail, Tynes said\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. The Florida mother had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said. Grier\u2019s next court appearance is July 5, police said. US lawmakers tried to free Americans The Americans\u2019 arrest has stoked tension between US officials and their counterparts just a few hundred miles away. A request by a US congressional delegation to the islands in May for charges against the five Americas to be dropped did not yield the desired result. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Republican US Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said May 20 in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully (in) Turks and Caicos,\u201d Republican US Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler told ABC News the same week. Meanwhile, the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the United Nations for humanitarian concerns, Reschenthaler told CNN. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler wanted to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on May 20. \u201cThey were innocent mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On May 28, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, calling it \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_26_middleeast_israel-gaza-rescue-operation-palestinian-toll-intl-cmd", "text": "Bullet holes fleck the bloodstained walls of the Miqdad family home, in Nuseirat camp, central Gaza. CNN footage from the house shows a cream teddy bear perched on a white cupboard, with broken plastic strewn across the shelves. In another room, mother-of-four Rasha Abdel Miqdad shudders with grief, before breaking down in tears. \u201cThis is the blood of my son, Yamen. May God bless his soul,\u201d the 32-year-old Palestinian told CNN on June 12. \u201cMy son was innocent. \u201cWe are civilians, and we have no connection to the resistance or anything or any faction. We have no connection to it at all.\u201d CNN spoke to seven members of the family who described a horror-filled haze of gunfire, tank artillery and aerial bombardment around their home on June 8. Israeli forces stormed through the building searching for militants and indiscriminately spraying bullets, according to the family members. Four people suffered gunshot wounds, leaving one child severely injured and 12-year-old Yamen dead, the family alleged to CNN. Soldiers interrogated and beat male relatives, and forced a child to strip, relatives claimed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released footage on June 16 showing forces in the Miqdad\u2019s house on the same day as a\u00a0high-profile hostage rescue operation\u00a0nearby. In the heavily edited video, shared on social media and described as forces \u201csecuring the area\u201d during the operation, members of the Israeli Paratroopers Reconnaissance Battalion appear to enter the home. The video does not show what happened on the third floor, where the family say they were attacked. CNN has reached out to the IDF but has not received a response to the specific allegations made. The allegations provide a window into the scale and force of this\u00a0Israeli\u00a0operation\u00a0to free hostages taken during the attack on Israel last October. Eyewitnesses say they are still traumatized, after more than 270 Palestinians were killed and another 698 people injured on June 8, according to authorities in Gaza. Health staff said that hospitals, already stretched beyond their limits, were completely overwhelmed. These extremely high reported casualty tolls prompted renewed warnings from human rights organizations who say Israel is not doing enough to protect civilians as it prosecutes its war, and that militants are endangering Palestinian lives. The UN human rights office (OHCHR)\u00a0warned that\u00a0Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups may have committed war crimes through their actions. OHCHR spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the Israeli operation \u201cseriously calls into question whether the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution\u2026 were respected\u201d and that, by holding hostages in densely populated areas, Palestinian armed groups are \u201cputting the lives of Palestinian civilians, as well as the hostages themselves, at added risk.\u201d It was not clear how many of those killed were militants. The Ministry of Health in Gaza does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. But the ministry said many of those impacted were women and children, as well as people recently displaced by Israel\u2019s offensive in the southern city\u00a0of Rafah. The IDF has disputed the ministry\u2019s numbers, claiming that casualties from the operation were \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the casualty figures given by either side. The IDF said special forces teams launched the rescue operation in Nuseirat camp just after 11 a.m. local time, and by 11:25 a.m. had begun\u00a0raids\u00a0on both buildings where hostages were being held. After exchanging heavy fire with militants, and as the surrounding area came under intense Israeli missile and rocket fire, the special forces retrieved the hostages then started to travel out of the camp, toward an area near the US military\u2019s floating pier on the Mediterranean coast. It was along this route that Israeli forces stormed the Miqdad family house for between 30 and 45 minutes, according to eyewitness accounts corresponding with videos analyzed by CNN. Flames and plumes of smoke billow over wrecked vehicles in the aftermath of the operation, according to footage taken at 1:10 p.m. local time and obtained by CNN. Civilians wail over bodies heaped on top of each other, as young children look up to the sky in disbelief. In one frame, filmed on a nearby street, members of the Miqdad family can be seen carrying their injured children into a car as Israeli drones buzz overhead. The Miqdad family home, which a CNN team visited later, stands just under a mile (1.5 km) from the site where the hostages were held, as determined by CNN through video analysis. \u201cThey left nothing behind. It\u2019s all destroyed,\u201d said the mother Rasha, speaking fourtwo days after the operation. \u201cThe room is full of blood. My children\u2019s clothes are all blood. \u201cThere is no safe place\u2026 no place where we can protect ourselves.\u201d Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed 37,658 Palestinians and injured at least another 86,237 people, according to Gaza health officials. \u2018Felt like an earthquake\u2019 Artillery and missile fire erupted near the Miqdad family home before the Israeli forces entered on June 8, the father, Mohammad, told CNN. He said he gathered his family \u2013 some 14 people, mostly women and children \u2013 into a room. The family trembled with fear as the voices of soldiers grew closer, until, they claim, the troops kicked down the door, opened indiscriminate fire, threw stun grenades and pointed weapons at some of the children. \u201cThey came to the apartment we were at, and started shooting and saying, \u2018Who is here, who is here?\u2019 We told them we were civilians, children and women,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Rasha told CNN the raid \u201cfelt like an earthquake,\u201d adding that soldiers confiscated their cell phones. \u201cThey carried weapons, pointing them at an eight-month-old baby and a four-month-old baby.\u201d Israeli troops detained the two men present and demanded to know whether there were any militants in the building, Mohammad said. He and his father-in-law, Abdul Raouf, 58, tried to declare their innocence. Then, they allege, soldiers forced bags over their heads, tied their hands behind their backs and physically assaulted them. Mohammad\u2019s second oldest child, Ahmad, is still reeling from the attack. The 13-year-old told CNN he could hear the soldiers beating his father and grandfather in the hallway, before he claims he was himself forced to strip. Soldiers then told him to put his clothes back on, he said, before he was taken out of the room and \u201cpunched,\u201d pointing to his face. \u201cHe asked me to take off my clothes to make sure I was a little boy,\u201d Ahmad recalled. \u201cHe threw me to the ground and put blindfolds on me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wanted to tie me, but I started kicking with my feet, so he put his shoe here,\u201d he said, pointing to his neck, \u201cand stepped on me to silence me. \u201cThey meant to kill me.\u201d Mohammad told CNN that before the Israeli forces withdrew, they threatened to shoot his relatives, after which he heard gunshots. \u201cThe soldier said, \u2018If you don\u2019t tell me where the resistance fighters are and where the weapon is in your house, I will kill your children,\u2019\u201d Mohammad said. \u201cHe went to the room,\u201d he said, referring to the part of the house where the women and children were, adding, \u201cA minute after, and I heard the gunshots.\u201d Ahmad told CNN: \u201cAt that moment, we assumed my brothers had been killed.\u201d It is not clear if any of the family members were hit in the second round of shooting. Bullet casings that appear in a video filmed by CNN at the house are stamped with IMI, which denotes the Israeli weapons manufacturer Israeli Military Industries, according to two weapons experts, Richard Weir, senior researcher in the Crisis and Conflict division at Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member. One casing is a 9mm caliber, likely a pistol, or a machine pistol or a submachine gun, Weir said. Israeli forces were in the house for up to 45 minutes, family members told CNN. When they eventually left, Mohammad, still blindfolded, says he called on Rasha to remove the bag over his head. They say their two sons were limp and bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds. One of their children, Mumen, 16, says he was shot in his shoulder and abdomen, while his younger brother, Yamen, 12, had bullet injuries to his abdomen and leg. \u201cI called the ambulance, but they said they cannot come because the area is dangerous,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Instead, the family raced north by car to Al-Awda Hospital. But for Yamen, it was too late. \u201cThey gave him CPR for 10 minutes, but he was already martyred,\u201d Mohammad said. Scenes of \u2018massacre\u2019 at local hospitals The footage obtained by CNN from the area shows survivors clambering over rubble as missiles streak across the sky. Entire buildings are hollowed out. Palestinian men and boys delicately cover dead bodies with blankets, trying to give dignity to those killed in the Israeli\u00a0operation. Hospital workers say they could not manage the flood of casualties from the daytime raid, which was carried out when the streets and market were busy with people. At least 250 Palestinians wounded in Nuseirat were transferred from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital to Nasser Hospital, according to health authorities. Al-Aqsa hospital is serving nearly five times the number of in-patients it had pre-war with just one functioning electricity generator, the UN\u2019s Office for Humanitarian Affairs reported\u00a0on June 10. Footage from\u00a0the hospital courtyard\u00a0taken on June 8 shows trucks lined with shrouded bodies and men trying to comfort shellshocked children, as scores of Palestinians clamor to get seen by medics. \u201cThere were many martyrs lying in the streets,\u201d said Rasha\u2019s mother, 54. \u201cThe street was full of people and the planes were shooting.\u201d Critical shortages of resources including painkillers at Al-Aqsa hospital hampered efforts to treat trauma wounds \u2013 including severe burns, open fractures, amputations and brain injuries, aid workers with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, told CNN.\u00a0Israel\u2019s siege\u00a0of Gaza has drastically reduced the entry of medical and other supplies. \u201cIt was just like a plane crash had happened,\u201d said Karin Huster, an MSF staffer who treated patients in the hours after the attack. \u201cPretty much everybody was on the floor, kids, women\u2026 hundreds of people. \u201cIt takes a special kind of people to survive this,\u201d she told CNN on June 11. Another health worker at Al-Aqsa hospital, Maryame El Abbassi, said she is emotionally scarred after treating a severely burned child whose face \u201cwas melting\u201d between her hands. \u201cI wish I wouldn\u2019t have experienced the massacre,\u201d the 23-year-old nurse told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t think they invented any words that can describe how cruel the situation was\u2026 There were so many children brought in by strangers. \u201cThose kids will be traumatized until the end of their life,\u201d she said. Mumen, who is still being treated for wounds to his shoulder and abdomen, having been moved to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, drew in labored breaths as he recalled what happened to his brother. \u201cMy younger brother, Yamen, I saw them shooting him,\u201d Mumen said on June 10. \u201cThey came into the room and simply shot us, without saying a word\u2026 My future is gone. My life is gone.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/middleeast/israel-gaza-rescue-operation-palestinian-toll-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_europe_nigel-farage-ukraine-russia-eu-provoke-intl", "text": "Nigel Farage, a figurehead of the UK\u2019s populist right, has sparked outrage from political opponents after saying the West \u201cprovoked\u201d Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Farage \u2013 who heads the fast-growing Reform UK political party and was a pivotal figure in in Brexit \u2013 is seeking to win a seat in parliament for the first time in next month\u2019s general election. During an interview with the BBC Friday, Farage was asked if he stood by a tweet posted in February 2022 which called Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine a \u201cconsequence of EU and NATO expansion.\u201d \u201cWhy did I say that? It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union was giving this man [Putin] a reason to his Russian people to say they\u2019re coming for us again, and to go to war,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson. \u201cWe\u2019ve provoked this war \u2013 of course it\u2019s his fault \u2013\u00a0he\u2019s used what we\u2019ve done as an excuse,\u201d he said. Farage \u2013 a former EU parliamentarian \u2013 claimed to be \u201cthe only person in British politics\u201d to predict the invasion of Ukraine. Following his BBC appearance, Farage took to X and clarified his comments. \u201cI am one of the few figures that have been consistent & honest about the war with Russia,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPutin was wrong to invade a sovereign nation, and the EU was wrong to expand eastward.\u201d Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reacted to the comments today while speaking to journalists. \u201cWhat he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin\u2019s hands,\u201d said Sunak. \u201cThis kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain\u2019s security.\u201d Former Conservative defence secretary Ben Wallace spoke to the BBC\u2019s Today program about Farage\u2019s comments, where he called the Reform leader \u201ca bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says \u2018Oh no, if I was running the country\u2019 and presents very simplistic answers to actually, I am afraid in the 21st century, complex problems.\u201d Labour leader Keir Starmer also responded to Farage\u2019s comments, calling them \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in an interview with Sky News. \u201cI think anybody who wants to stand to be a representative in our parliament should be really clear that whether it\u2019s Russian aggression on the battlefield, or online, that we stand against that aggression. That\u2019s standing behind Ukraine but also standing up for our freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are disgraceful comments, which reveal the true face of Nigel Farage: a Putin apologist who should never be trusted with our nation\u2019s security,\u201d wrote John Healey, a Labour MP and shadow Defence Secretary. He added that Farage has \u201cshown that he would rather lick Vladimir Putin\u2019s boot than stand up for the people of Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/europe/nigel-farage-ukraine-russia-eu-provoke-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
