Nikhil Gupta\u00a0has been accused\u00a0by U.S. federal prosecutors of plotting with an Indian government official to kill\u00a0Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a U.S. resident who advocated for a sovereign Sikh state in northern India. Gupta traveled to Prague from India last June and was arrested by Czech authorities. Last month, a Czech court rejected his petition to avoid being sent to the U.S., clearing the way for the Czech justice minister to extradite him. An inmate search by name on the Bureau of Prisons website showed on Sunday that Gupta, 52, is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, a federal administrative detention facility. A source familiar with the matter, who did not want to be identified, separately confirmed Gupta\u2019s extradition and his detention in Brooklyn. A U.S. Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. Gupta\u2019s U.S.-based lawyer, attorney Jeffrey Chabrowe, had no immediate comment. There was also no immediate comment from Czech authorities. The discovery\u00a0of assassination plots against Sikh separatists\u00a0in the U.S. and Canada has tested relations with India, seen by Western nations as a counter to China\u2019s rising global influence. India\u2019s government denies involvement in the plots. Canada said\u00a0in September\u00a0its intelligence agencies were pursuing allegations linking India\u2019s government to the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 in Canada. In November, U.S. authorities said an Indian government official had directed the plot in the attempted murder of Pannun, who is a U.S. and Canadian citizen. Gupta is accused of involvement in that plot. Pannun told Reuters on Sunday that while the extradition was a welcome step, \u201cNikhil Gupta is just a foot soldier.\u201d He alleged that those who hired Gupta were senior members of the Indian government who act on the direction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India\u2019s government has\u00a0dissociated itself\u00a0from the plot against Pannun, saying it was against government policy. It has said it would formally investigate security concerns raised by Washington. New Delhi has\u00a0long complained\u00a0about Sikh separatist groups outside India, viewing them as security threats. The groups have kept alive the movement for\u00a0Khalistan, or the demand for an independent Sikh state to be carved out of India. Last month, Washington said it was satisfied so far with India\u2019s moves to ensure accountability in the alleged plots, but added that\u00a0many steps\u00a0still needed to be taken.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/world/indian-suspect-in-plot-to-kill-sikh-separatist-extradited-to-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_asia_north-korea-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has landed in North Korea for a rare visit that signals the two countries\u2019 deepening alignment and Moscow\u2019s need to source weapons from Pyongyang to sustain its war on Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally greeted Putin at the plane ramp as he arrived in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang in the early hours of Wednesday morning local time, video footage of his arrival showed. State media RIA reported that the two leaders talked animatedly with each other for several minutes before reaching their motorcade. The pair then rode together to the Kumsusan State Guest House where Putin will be staying, according to North Korean state media KCNA, and the two leaders \u201cexchanged their pent-up innermost thoughts and opened their minds to more surely develop (North Korea-Russia) relations in conformity with the common desire and will of the peoples of the two countries.\u201d After arriving at the guesthouse, they held a \u201cfriendly chat,\u201d KCNA added. The streets of Pyongyang were decked out with Russian flags and posters of Putin ahead of his first visit to the country since 2000. This week\u2019s visit is a rare overseas trip for Putin since he launched the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and a key moment for Kim, who has not hosted another world leader in his politically isolated country since the Covid-19 pandemic. Putin\u2019s visit will be closely watched across the world and is expected to cement further the burgeoning partnership between the two powers that is founded on their shared animosity toward the West and driven by Moscow\u2019s need for munitions for its war in Ukraine. Following his visit to North Korea, Putin is scheduled to travel to Hanoi in a display of Communist-governed Vietnam\u2019s ties to Russia that is likely to rankle the United States. Putin\u2019s trip to North Korea will have a \u201cvery eventful\u201d agenda, his aide Yuri Ushakov said during a press conference Monday. Both leaders plan to sign a new strategic partnership, Ushakov said. Ushakov insisted the agreement is not provocative or aimed against other countries, but is meant to ensure greater stability in northeast Asia. He said the new agreement will replace documents signed between Moscow and Pyongyang in 1961, 2000 and 2001. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs and Maxar Technologies showed preparations for a large parade in Pyongyang\u2019s central square. One image was of a grandstand being constructed on the eastern side of Kim Il Sung Square, the site where all major parades in North Korea are held. In an earlier image, taken on June 5, North Koreans can be seen practicing marching formations. US national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday the Biden administration wasn\u2019t \u201cconcerned about the trip\u201d itself, but added, \u201cWhat we are concerned about is the deepening relationship between these two countries.\u201d The US, South Korea and other countries have accused North Korea of providing substantial military aid to Russia\u2019s war effort in recent months, while observers have raised concerns that Moscow may be violating international sanctions to aid Pyongyang\u2019s development of its nascent military satellite program. Both countries have denied North Korean arms exports. Putin\u2019s trip reciprocates one Kim made last September, when the North Korean leader traveled in his armored train to Russia\u2019s far eastern region, for a visit that included stops at a factory that produces fighter jets and a rocket-launch facility. It also comes as tensions remain high on the Korean peninsula amid heightened international concern about the North Korean leader\u2019s intentions as he ramped up bellicose language and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea. South Korea fired warning shots on Tuesday after North Korean soldiers working in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas briefly crossed into the South, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, the second incident of its kind in the last two weeks. An \u2018advancing partnership\u2019 Kim last week hailed the future of the countries\u2019 \u201cmeaningful ties and close comradeship\u201d in a message to Putin commemorating Russia\u2019s national day on June 12. \u201cOur people give full support and solidarity to the successful work of the Russian army and people,\u201d Kim said, according to the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper. In an article for the same newspaper published early Tuesday local time, Putin thanked Pyongyang for showing \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and said the two countries were \u201cready to confront the ambition of the collective West.\u201d He said the two were \u201cactively advancing their multifaceted partnership\u201d and would \u201cdevelop alternative trade and mutual settlements mechanisms not controlled by the West, jointly oppose illegitimate unilateral restrictions, and shape the architecture of equal and indivisible security in Eurasia.\u201d The meeting comes just days after a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) developed economies in Italy attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Western leaders reiterated their enduring support for Ukraine and agreed to use profits from frozen Russian assets to back a $50 billion loan to the war-torn country. It also follows a Kyiv-backed international peace summit over the weekend attended by more than 100 countries and organizations, which was meant to drum up support for Zelensky\u2019s vision for peace, which calls for a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. Putin rebuffed those efforts a day ahead of the gathering by offering his own peace conditions, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four partially occupied regions and that Kyiv withdraw its bid to join NATO \u2013 a position seen as nonstarter by Ukraine and its allies. Putin\u2019s visit to North Korea is widely viewed as an opportunity for him to seek to bolster Kim\u2019s support for his war \u2013 a goal that may be increasingly urgent as long-delayed American military aid for Ukraine comes online. Last month, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told American lawmakers the provision of North Korean munitions and missiles, as well as Iranian drones, had allowed Russian forces \u201cto get back up on their feet.\u201d Between August and February, Pyongyang shipped about 6,700 containers to Russia, which could accommodate more than 3 million rounds of 152 mm artillery shells or more than 500,000 rounds of 122 mm multiple rocket launchers, South Korea\u2019s defense ministry said earlier this year. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied such arms transfers, with a senior North Korean official last month calling such allegations an \u201cabsurd paradox.\u201d When asked about concerns that Russia is considering the transfer of sensitive technologies to Pyongyang in exchange for those goods, a Kremlin spokesperson last week said the countries\u2019 \u201cpotential for developing bilateral relations\u201d was \u201cprofound\u201d and \u201cshould not cause concern to anyone and should not and cannot be challenged by anyone.\u201d Putin on the world stage Putin last visited North Korea in 2000, his first year as president of Russia, where he met with Kim\u2019s predecessor and late father Kim Jong Il. His travel now to North Korea and then Vietnam comes as the Russian leader appears keen to re-establish himself on the global stage, chipping away at an image of isolation in the wake of his widely condemned invasion of Ukraine by drawing in like-minded partners. Last month Putin made a state visit to Beijing, where he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping made a sweeping affirmation of their shared opposition to what they see as a US-led world order. Moscow last week hosted foreign ministers from countries including China, Iran, South Africa and Brazil for a meeting of the BRICS group of major developing economies. US national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday called Putin\u2019s latest travel a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d following the leader\u2019s re-election. Putin won his fifth term earlier this year in a contest without true opposition. Putin\u2019s move to bolster North Korean ties has also been a boon for Kim, who remains unbowed by years of international sanctions over his illegal nuclear weapons program. The visit from a leader of a permanent member country of the United Nations Security Council will provide a signal to Kim\u2019s domestic audience of his global clout \u2013 and a chance to push for deeply needed economic and technological support from Moscow. Russia previously backed international sanctions and UN-backed investigations into North Korea\u2019s illegal weapons program, which includes tests of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that could in theory reach the US mainland. But Russia\u2019s apparent increasing reliance on North Korea and rising frictions with the West appear to have shifted that dynamic. In March, Moscow vetoed a UN resolution to renew independent monitoring of North Korea\u2019s violations of Security Council sanctions.

{"id": "2024_06_16_europe_ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-intl", "text": "A two-day summit in Switzerland dedicated to forging a path forward to end the war in Ukraine concluded with key powers spurning a joint communique agreed to by more than 80 other countries and international organizations. India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom have important trading relationships with Russia as members of the BRICS economic group, attended the weekend meeting but did not agree to sign the joint statement. The document reaffirmed the signatories commitment to \u201crefraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognized borders.\u201d Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists at a news conference alongside the leaders of the European Union, Ghana, Canada, Chile and Switzerland that it was \u201cimportant that all participants of this summit support this Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity because there is will be no lasting peace without territorial integrity.\u201d More than 100 countries and organizations gathered at an idyllic lakeside resort near Lucerne to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan Zelensky first outlined late in 2022. That formula includes demands for a cessation of hostilities, the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s pre-war borders with Russia \u2013 terms Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to ever agree to. Among the high-level dignitaries in attendance were the leaders of Argentina, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. US Vice President Kamala Harris was also in attendance and used the occasion to announce a $1.5 billion aid package that would go toward humanitarian expenditures and help Kyiv rebuilt its battered infrastructure. \u201cThis high level attendance shows one thing. The world cares deeply about the war provoked by Russia\u2019s aggression,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Despite the strong showing among Western democracies, there had been questions ahead of the event as to just how much could be accomplished given that neither Russia nor China, whose increasingly close trading relationship with Moscow has helped the Kremlin survive Western sanctions, were attending. The communique published on Sunday said that signatories had struck several other agreements. Among them were the principle that Ukraine to should be allowed its own nuclear power plants \u2013 including the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant \u2013 and that the Kremlin refrain from both the use of and the threat of using nuclear weapons. The sides also said that all children and civilians that were unlawfully displaced must be returned to Ukraine. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin\u2019s own peace plan, which calls for Ukrainian troops withdraw from four southern and eastern regions of Ukrainian territory that Moscow said it would annex in violation of international law and demands Kyiv abandon its bid to join\u00a0NATO. While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who traveled with Harris to Switzerland, told reporters at the summit that Putin\u2019s framework \u201cdefies basic morality.\u201d \u201cHe (Putin) said, not only does Ukraine have to give up the territory Russia currently occupies, but Ukraine has to leave additional sovereign Ukrainian territory before Russia will negotiate. And Ukraine must disarm so that is vulnerable to future Russian aggression down the road. No responsible nation could say that is a reasonable basis for peace,\u201d Sullivan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/europe/ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_style_brooke-shields-crocs-tony-awards-red-carpet", "text": "Many celebrities will be well-versed in the power of the statement heel to complete a red carpet look, but at the Tony Awards on Sunday night in New York, Brooke Shields stole the spotlight in a statement flat. Stepping out in a pair of sunny Crocs to match her bright yellow Monique Lhuillier gown, the star made absolutely zero apologies for the sure-to-be controversial footwear choice, playfully lifting her dress to reveal to reporters she had indeed traded in heels for practical clogs. \u201cI\u2019ve got two theatre-loving shoes on,\u201d she told the Associated Press. Shields further explained that she had foot surgery several days before the event. \u201cBroadway gave me these broken feet, and now I\u2019m fixing them,\u201d the actor, who has starred in theater productions like \u201cChicago,\u201d \u201cCabaret\u201d and \u201cGrease,\u201d told CBS, As a former face of Calvin Klein, Shields has never been far from fashion\u2019s inner circle and has become synonymous with \u201call-American,\u201d timeless style. Her latest sartorial choice on is seemingly in line with what the actor has called her \u201cf*ck it era,\u201d according to Glamour magazine. Shields, 59, speaks regularly about the confidence she has found as she has gotten older. \u201cI\u2019m so excited about this age and era of life because I\u2019m less complicated, less insecure, less egomaniacal, and I\u2019m focusing on that,\u201d she recently told Vogue. Chunky, with signature Swiss cheese holes and often in jarringly bright colors; since their debut in 2004, Crocs have divided opinion \u2014 and often been derided by fashion insiders and experts. But the clogs, made of a special resin called Croslite, are loved by comfort-seekers, and they do have a track record with celebrities too. Singer Justin Bieber paired an oversized Balenciaga suit with platform Crocs to the 2022 Grammys (his own clothing brand Drew House has collaborated with the label in the past), while record producer Questlove wore a shiny golden pair to the 2021 Oscars. Even as far back as 2015, actor Alan Cumming (pictured above) sported Crocs to the Emmys with his Vivienne Westwood ensemble. Founded in Boulder, Colorado by three friends in 2002, Crocs were an immediate success when they first hit the market. By 2007 the company was selling 50 million pairs a year. But the 2008 financial crisis and a saturated market saw the company go from $200 million in profit in 2007 to $200 million in losses the next year. In recent years, the company has teamed up with brands and celebrities to release special editions. There was a glow-in-the-dark collaboration with Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny in 2020, which sold out soon after its release, a lime green crossover with Dreamwork\u2019s \u201cShrek\u201d in 2023 and a long-running partnership with Balenciaga that\u2019s yielded an assortment of Crocs boots, stilettos, and platforms. These efforts may be paying off: Crocs reported a record year of earnings in 2023, with total revenue reaching nearly $4 billion dollars. Will they become a red carpet mainstay? Probably not, but Shields\u2019 outfit did garner plenty of support from her fans on social media: \u201cYou\u2019re a trend setter and a very cool one at that!\u201d wrote one commenter below the actor\u2019s Instagram post showing off her Crocs. \u201cWe are utterly obsessed,\u201d said another.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_africa_british-army-abandoned-children-kenya-intl", "text": "Seventeen-year-old Marian Pannalossy cuts a striking figure wherever she goes in Archer\u2019s Post, a small town 200 miles north of Nairobi. She lives alone and is light-skinned in a place where mixed-race people are a rarity and therefore ostracized. \u201cThey call me \u2018mzungu maskini,\u2019 or a poor white girl,\u201d she told CNN at her single-room house, a tremor in her voice.\u00a0\u201cThey always say \u2018Why are you here? Just look for connections so that you can go to your own people. You don\u2019t belong here. You\u2019re not supposed to be here suffering.\u2019\u201d Marian believes that her father was a British soldier, but she has never met him. She does not even know his name. Marian is among a group of mixed-race children whose mothers say they were conceived after rape by British soldiers training in Kenya. Her mother, Lydia Juma, was among hundreds of Kenyan women who filed complaints with the UK military over the years, as documented by Kenya\u2019s human rights body. \u201cI don\u2019t know why God is punishing me. I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Juma said through tears in a powerful \u202f2011 documentary, \u2018The Rape of the Samburu Women.\u2019 Marian, aged four at the time, sat on her lap, sometimes hugging her mother as she wept and recounted how she was violated and the suffering she had endured since. \u00a0\u00a0Juma\u2019s live-in boyfriend, with whom she had two older children, left her after she gave birth to Marian, a mixed-race child, because rape is a taboo in their culture. \u201cThe moment he saw that the child is \u2018white,\u2019 he went, and he went forever,\u201d she said in the film. Juma died two years after that interview without ever finding the man she says raped her. Mixed-race children continue to be born in the remote villages where the British Army trains its soldiers in Kenya. The British Army Training Unit, Kenya (BATUK), is headquartered in the town of Nanyuki, about 70 miles southwest of Archer\u2019s Post. BATUK is currently under investigation by the Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Relations committee of Kenya\u2019s National Assembly. It has held public hearings in several areas where British troops train and heard a litany of complaints about abuse, exploitation, and sexual assaults from communities around them. It intends to hear from BATUK officials and the British High Commissioner to Kenya at the end of its work later this month, according to a schedule shared with CNN. One of the more contentious accusations against British soldiers involves the case of Agnes Wanjiru. Wanjiru, a 21-year-old Kenyan woman, vanished in 2012 after entering a hotel with British soldiers, according to reports. Her body was later found in a septic tank. Despite a Kenyan inquest ruling her death a murder and the reported identification of a suspect by fellow soldiers, the British soldier allegedly involved hasn\u2019t faced charges. Wanjiru\u2019s family believes British officials are\u00a0indifferent to her case\u00a0and pleaded with the King for help during his visit to Kenya. A British High Commission spokesperson said it takes all allegations raised by the community seriously and it will ensure thorough investigations. \u201cAll sexual activity which involves the abuse of power, including buying sex whether in the UK or abroad, is prohibited,\u201d the British High Commission, speaking on behalf of BATUK, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are committed to preventing sexual exploitation in any form and investigate and hold to account any Service Personnel found to be involved in it.\u201d \u2018British boys behaving badly\u2019 Britain pays Kenya about $400,000 a year to allow its soldiers to train in the East African country, mostly in the expansive wildlife conservancies in Laikipia and Samburu counties. Kenya renewed the defense pact in 2021 despite strong local opposition. BATUK has a permanent training base in Nanyuki, to the south of those wildlife conservancies, with 100 full-time staff. The Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Relations committee\u2019s work has renewed scrutiny of the British Army\u2019s operations in Kenya and once again brought attention to the cases of the women who have accused soldiers of rape over several decades. Allegations of rape and other crimes, including murder, by British soldiers deployed there date back to the 1950s. \u201cThis to us is an example of British boys behaving badly,\u201d said Marion Mutugi,\u00a0a commissioner for the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.\u201cThis is a matter of taking care of the vulnerable in our society who our constitution says require special protection.\u201d She\u2019s referring to hundreds of women from the mostly pastoralist Maasai and Samburu communities who accused the British Army of rapes in the 1970s and 80s. They were represented by the British lawyer Martyn Day in a landmark civil case in London in the early 2000s. Ntoyie Lenkanan, 72, was among the complainants in the British case. \u00a0\u00a0Nearly forty years later, her voice trembles with emotion and barely controlled anger as she recounts her ordeal. \u201cI was going to fetch water when I was ambushed by a group of British soldiers who were hiding in the grass near the river. One of them grabbed me and raped me,\u201d she told CNN at her home in DolDol, about 35 miles north of Nanyuki. She has been waiting years for an official acknowledgment of the violation and compensation, but neither has come. A few miles from Lenkanan\u2019s home in the sparsely populated arid lands of DolDol, Saitet\u00a0Noltwalal\u00a0who is in her 70s, sits under a tree. She is blind and frail, relying on her family for everything. She, too, says she was raped by a British soldier at a hill near her home a few decades ago but she no longer remembers the exact period. \u201cI have been waiting a long time and I can no longer fend for myself. I wouldn\u2019t like what happened to me to happen to anyone else,\u201d she said. Her quality of life nosedived after the rape as she miscarried the child and lost her eyesight shortly after, she said. Some of her peers who accused the British Army of sexual violations have died while waiting for redress. In 2007, Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense dismissed claims\u202fof rape brought by 2,187 women, Lenkanan and Noltwalal among them, saying \u201cthere was no reliable evidence to support any single allegation.\u201d A Royal Military Police investigation at the time concluded that most of the Kenyan evidence appeared to have been fabricated.The UK investigators did not conduct DNA tests on any of the 69 mixed-race children alleged to have been born\u00a0from rape by British soldiers. Some of the women testified in 2009 about being preyed on by British soldiers as they went about their daily chores to Kenya\u2019s Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 2008 to hear from victims of injustices spanning from 1963 to 2008, including ethnic conflicts and political violence among others. And Kenya\u2019s Truth Justice and reconciliation commission claims the government in Nairobi lost the case files, without explanation. \u201cThe most horrific allegation of rape is said to have (occurred) in October 1997 at Archer\u2019s Post where 30 women were gang raped by British soldiers, often at knifepoint and sometimes inside the victims\u2019 own manyattas (compounds),\u201d the 2009 report said. A new day in court British soldiers can now be sued in Kenyan courts for any wrongdoing as part of a new addition to the 2021 defense pact signed between both countries. It means many of these women may finally have their day in court. Kenya also has no statute of limitations on cases involving alleged human rights abuses. So, 17 years later, lawyer Kelvin Kubai has signed up more than 300 of the women who previously brought rape claims and is working to reintroduce the case in Kenyan courts. Seventeen-year-old Marian will be the lead plaintiff. \u201cIt is traumatic and psychologically disturbing to people like Marian and many others who continue to see the British training amidst them with all these unresolved trauma and historical injustices,\u201d Kubai told CNN after meeting some of the pastoralist women who allege wrongdoing by British soldiers. \u201cWe can win because we have a very progressive constitution. The Kenyan legal system offers a better redress than what is available in the UK,\u201d he said. Abandoned children Kenyan women say they continue to struggle for recognition even for children conceived in consensual relationships with British soldiers. Generica Namoru, 28, says she started a consensual relationship in 2017 with a soldier while she worked at the BATUK headquarters in Nanyuki. \u201cHe went back to the UK when I was two months pregnant. He is the one that chose her name when she was born,\u201d she told CNN. Namoru says the soldier sent his passport and other personal information for the newborn\u2019s birth certificate. Her daughter Nicole, five, bears his last name, she told CNN, but he has never supported her. Namoru is unemployed and has to \u201chustle\u201d for her and Nicole\u2019s upkeep by selling fresh water in the semi-arid town where they live. \u201cI\u2019m a woman with a \u2018white\u2019 child. It\u2019s not easy for my family especially because a child is expensive,\u201d she said, pointing out that Nicole has no health insurance nor a permanent home. \u201cShe\u2019s suffering for no reason. I want him to take care of her education, health and shelter. Nothing else.\u201d In the meantime, Kabui the lawyer and his team have set up a crowdfunding campaign to support Marian, Nicole, and other \u201cabandoned children of British Army soldiers in Kenya with education and legal fees,\u201d he told CNN. Namoru says that she has tried without success to get the Kenyan or British governments to locate her ex-boyfriend and compel him to take financial responsibility for his daughter. The British High Commission in Nairobi told CNN that it cooperates with local child support authorities in paternity claims. Neither Nicole nor Marian have UK citizenship even though they qualify if they can prove their fathers are English. \u201cIt\u2019s not like these kids are looking for a free ticket to the UK. We\u2019re just saying that they deserve to get parental\u00a0care from their fathers that every child deserves,\u201d Mutugi of the Human Rights Commission said, claiming that the British government had shown no interest in resolving the cases. \u201cThese children deserve British citizenship. They\u2019re British kids.

{"id": "washington-earthquake-tsunami-violent-earth", "text": "A catastrophic earthquake and tsunami are inevitable for the coast of the Pacific Northwest, scientists say. Planning for that means imagining a disaster unlike anything that\u2019s ever hit the modern United States. \u201c30 or 40 years ago, we didn\u2019t even know that big earthquakes were possible in the Pacific Northwest,\u201d said Diego Melgar, a seismologist at the University of Oregon. Scientists now know the 700-mile fault called the Cascadia Subduction Zone, 100 miles off the coast of Northern California stretching north to Vancouver Island, could trigger a 9.0 magnitude earthquake followed by a tsunami, which is exactly what happened in Japan 2011. New in-depth imagery of the fault was recently reported in \u201cScience Advances.\u201d Scientists say it confirmed the subduction zone is cut into 3 to 5 segments, each with its own unique geology. When the segment of the fault off Washington\u2019s coast ruptures, it has the greatest potential of triggering a devastating earthquake. No one is ready for this. Nothing built prior to 2005 was designed to withstand the long, strong earthquake Cascadia will produce, according to Corina Allen\ufeff, the chief hazards geologist at the  Washington Geological Survey. And tsunami building codes only went into effect in 2016. \u201cWe have bridges, buildings, hospitals, schools, all of this infrastructure that is located in places where a tsunami could go,\u201d Allen said. Can these facilities survive an earthquake and tsunami that will follow? \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d \u201cWhat keeps me up at night is that I know that we\u2019re not taking the steps that we need to, as fast as we should be, to protect our people,\u201d said Yumei Wang, a senior adviser of infrastructure and risk at Portland State University.  Brick and masonry buildings are the most vulnerable in earthquakes. And Wang says wood frame buildings are particularly vulnerable to tsunami forces. \u201cYou can just imagine water pushing over a typical house,\u201d she adds. The geological record of the region indicates on average, these mega earthquake and tsunami events happen every 500 years. There is no way to predict when one will happen next, but it\u2019s expected to happen again within the next 200 years \u2013 or less It will be a long process and cost billions of dollars to retrofit existing communities, Allen said. Melgar believes the effort is well worth it. \u201cMy children might not see dividends, my grandchildren might not see dividends. We\u2019re playing a really long game if we\u2019re doing it right.\u201d. For those who live and vacation along the coastal Pacific Northwest, surviving a tsunami that comes 15 to 30 minutes after an earthquake depends on how quickly they can reach high ground. But there may be no safe place to go. \u201cIn Washington, most people who actually live in the tsunami inundation zone don\u2019t have any high ground nearby,\u201d Allen said. In that case, vertical evacuation structures built within the tsunami zone are vital. These structures helped save thousands of lives in the 2011 tsunami in Japan. Only three have been built in the Pacific Northwest, and four more are planned. But Allen estimates that 50 are needed in Washington alone. Each of the three existing structures could hold 400 to 1,000 people, reach up to 76 feet tall and vary in cost.\u00a0The most expensive, at $62 million, is the Marine Sciences Center in Oregon, Wang said.  \u201cThe foundation is deeper than the building is tall, like an iceberg. And the structure itself is a little bit like a car bumper, so that very heavy, big debris can hit it.\u201d \u201cWe know enough about building codes. We know enough about early warning. We know enough about tsunami evacuation zones that it need not be that bad,\u201d says Melgar. What is less clear is whether people are willing to invest billions of dollars to prepare for something that may not happen for 200 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a costly problem to solve,\u201d says Allen. \u201cMaybe we do have more time and we\u2019re able to put the systems in place that we need to survive this event.\u201d The problem is, nobody knows how much time remains.", "source": "http://cnn.com/washington-earthquake-tsunami-violent-earth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_middleeast_israel-plans-tactical-pause-gaza-what-we-know-mime-intl", "text": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has announced a \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activities along a road in southern Gaza that has been designated for humanitarian aid deliveries every day for 11 hours. The announcement comes as the strip\u2019s population of more than 2 million grapples with humanitarian conditions that the United Nations has described as \u201cunspeakable.\u201d The war, which began on October 7 in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages, is now in its ninth month with no indication of a ceasefire-hostage deal in the immediate future. The fighting has killed more than 37,000 people so far in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the enclave. On Saturday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Gaza in one of the deadliest single incidents since the war began. More than 300 IDF soldiers have died to date. The \u201cpause,\u201d which the IDF announced Sunday but COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, said came into effect on Saturday, raised questions about what it means for the conflict and for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Human rights groups have described health concerns \u201cbeyond crisis levels\u201d\u00a0for Palestinians in the enclave, with over 75% of the population displaced, according to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. The announcement also appeared to have deepened existing political rifts in the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unhappy when he first heard about it, according to one official. Here\u2019s what we know. What did Israel announce? The IDF announced that a \u201clocal, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes\u201d will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice. The pause began Saturday, the IDF said, and is meant to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northwards. The IDF has designated a specific route for aid trucks to take, which starts from Kerem Shalom to Al Bayuk neighborhood and onto the European Hospital in Khan Younis. The route will be run in coordination with international organizations, the IDF said, as part of efforts to increase volumes of aid reaching Gaza. Soon after announcing the move, the IDF said \u201cthe fighting in Rafah continues,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no change\u201d in the country\u2019s policy on aid into the strip. In response to a question by CNN\u2019s Paula Hancocks during a briefing to international media in Kerem Shalom on Monday, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that \u201csometimes when you say a tactical pause, people might think that we\u2019re stopping the fighting in Gaza.\u201d \u201cWe should\u2019ve clarified better that we are fighting in Gaza, that we are fighting in Rafah and we created this safe pass, in those hours, to make sure the distribution (of aid) is ongoing,\u201d Hagari said. What will it mean in practice? The IDF said the \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d is meant to help the UN collect and distribute aid at its crossings, where Israel has said aid is\u00a0piling up. COGAT said on Sunday that there are 1,000 humanitarian aid trucks on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing waiting to be collected and distributed. Georgios Petropoulos, head of the UN humanitarian affairs (UNOCHA) suboffice in Gaza, told CNN on Monday the pause \u201cwas not a new thing on the ground,\u201d and that there are a number of issues preventing aid workers from reaching parts of the Palestinian enclave. These include the fighting between Israel and Hamas, but also the danger that exists on travel routes as many parts of Gaza battle a state of lawlessness \u2013 where there is \u201ca lack of any police or rule of law,\u201d Petropoulos said. The pause is \u201csimply a packaging of an announcement reflecting what we have been doing here in Gaza for over a week,\u201d Petropoulos told CNN, adding that \u201cthat road was being used by the UN to move goods for days.\u201d When roads are dangerous, aid trucks cannot travel up them, he said. \u201cThe war between Hamas and Israel is not the only issue we have on the ground.\u201d It is unclear how effective the pause will be, as the IDF has previously designated other routes as safe paths for aid, only for aid convoys to be struck. In April, the deadly Israeli attack that killed seven aid workers from the non-profit World Central Kitchen (WCK) in Gaza hit what the team said was a \u201cdeconflicted zone\u201d in coordination with the Israeli military. Aid groups are saying that no difference has yet been seen on the ground. \u201cWe have not seen any improvements thus far,\u201d said Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza, stressing that \u201cthe law and order environment in Gaza is not enabling the efficient delivery of aid.\u201d The spokesperson for the UN Children\u2019s Fund, James Elder, warned the pause could not replace a ceasefire. \u201cI just don\u2019t know unfortunately (how long the pause will last), this is a question for the occupying power, for Israel and its military.\u201d What\u2019s the aid situation like in Gaza now? The more than eight-month long humanitarian crisis in Gaza is spiraling. Thousands have died in the besieged enclave, according to the health ministry there, and more than half the population has been internally displaced. Gazans are facing desperate levels of hunger, with more than 50,000 children in need of treatment for acute malnutrition, UNRWA said. Hospitals are in ruins, medical supplies are scarce and humanitarian access remains limited, the UN agency added. According to UNRWA\u2019s data, 60 trucks entered Gaza on June 12, the last batch of vehicles the UN agency has recorded. Land crossings, which aid groups say are the most effective way of getting aid into Gaza, remain limited. Out of five land crossings, only two have been open for aid trucks recently. Those are the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom and Western Erez crossings. A humanitarian pier\u00a0constructed by the US military off the coast of Gaza has also shuttered due to heavy seas, hampering maritime aid delivery. The Government Media Office (GMO) in Gaza has denied that a \u201ctactical pause\u201d is now in effect in the southern Gaza Strip. \u201cTalking about a tactical cessation of the war is an Israeli lie,\u201d the GMO said in a statement Sunday. \u201cWe are still demanding the opening of the Rafah crossing to meet the needs of the population, especially in the northern Gaza Strip.\u201d What has the Israeli government said? It is unclear who took the decision for the pause, as several senior Israeli officials seemed to have been kept in the dark ahead of the announcement. This includes the prime minister, who initially disowned the pause. According to one Israeli official, Netanyahu has raised the question of who ordered it and was unhappy when he first heard about it. The prime minister then contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, said the official who spoke to CNN on Sunday and requested anonymity. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also condemned the pause. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. These disagreements, which burst out into the open across statements and in Israeli media, have only deepened rifts in the country\u2019s government. An IDF spokesman said Monday the pause had been approved by Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. He said this kind of decision would first be made by COGAT and the Southern Command, and then go up the chain of command for approval, depending on the situation. When asked if this kind of decision would need approval from the Israeli government or cabinet, the spokesperson said, \u201cthis kind of decision does not necessarily need to be approved by the cabinet, and it was approved by the minister of defense.\u201d In an earlier statement Monday the IDF had said the decision was made by the military, not by the Israeli government. The announcement of the pause came \u201cafter the request of the political echelon of the IDF in recent weeks to allow the introduction of aid, and to announce this to the world,\u201d the military told CNN in a statement. The pause is meant to meet the demands of the International Court of Justice regarding Gaza aid deliveries ahead of a court hearing by the end of June, it added. The pause is \u201cintended for the hearing\u2026 at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where Israel will have to prove that it did not violate the order it issued regarding the fighting in Rafah,\u201d which prevented a court order to stop the war, the IDF said. The ICJ is investigating a case brought by Pretoria against Israel in which South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians during the war. In May, it ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in Rafah, saying the court considers the humanitarian situation in the southern city to be classified as \u201cdisastrous.\u201d Israeli officials condemned the ICJ\u2019s ruling.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/middleeast/israel-plans-tactical-pause-gaza-what-we-know-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 39-year-old made his tournament debut back in 2004, when host Portugal was beaten by Greece in the final. He went on to lead his nation to victory at Euro 2016, his only major trophy at international level, though he had to be substituted in the first half of the final after picking up an injury. Despite currently playing outside of Europe\u2019s main top-five leagues \u2013 he\u2019s now with\u00a0Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr \u2013 Ronaldo was picked by Portugal coach Roberto Martinez who praised the veteran striker for his goalscoring prowess before the tournament started. The forward started his country\u2019s opening Group F match against Czech Republic but, despite some flashes of quality, he had a relatively quiet game, though he did hit the post late on with a header, which was then turned in by Diogo Jota. However, the goal was ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR) as Ronaldo was narrowly offside. But Portugal kept searching for a winner and substitute Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o scored a dramatic late winner in the 92nd minute, tapping home from close range. Despite Portugal dominating proceedings, it was Czech Republic which scored first, courtesy of Luk\u00e1\u0161 Provod\u2019s fantastic long-range effort in the 62nd minute. Moments later, Portugal equalized thanks to a huge slice of luck. Czech Republic goalkeeper Jind\u0159ich Stan\u011bk failed to deal with a simple cross and parried it against his own defender, with the ball bouncing off Robin Hran\u00e1\u010d into the goal. Ronaldo has scored in all five of the European Championships that he\u2019s played in and is the competition\u2019s record goalscorer with 14 goals. He has the chance to become the oldest goalscorer at the Euros should he find the net in Germany this year. Ronaldo wasn\u2019t the only Portuguese player to make history on Tuesday.

{"id": "2024_06_18_world_nuclear-arsenals-strengthen-intl-latam", "text": "Nuclear-armed countries are strengthening their arsenals and several have made ready new nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable weapons systems amid rising geopolitical tensions, a new report has found. The nine nuclear states \u2013 the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel \u2013 have continued to modernize their weapons stockpiles, with China, for the first time, possibly deploying \u201ca small number of warheads on missiles during peacetime,\u201d the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)\u00a0said in a new report\u00a0published Monday. \u201cWhile the global total of nuclear warheads continues to fall as Cold War-era weapons are gradually dismantled, regrettably we continue to see year-on-year increases in the number of operational nuclear warheads,\u201d the institute\u2019s director Dan Smith said. \u201cThis trend seems likely to continue and probably accelerate in the coming years and is extremely concerning.\u201d In January 2024, the total global stockpile of warheads was estimated at 12,121, of which about 9,585 were in military stockpiles for potential use, according to SIPRI. The think tank estimates that 3,904 of those warheads were deployed with missiles and aircraft, or 60 more warheads than in January 2023. The majority of the deployed warheads, about 2,100, were kept \u201cin a state of high operational alert on ballistic missiles,\u201d SIPRI said. While nearly all of those warheads belonged to the US and Russia, for the first time China is also believed to have some warheads on high operational alert. Russia and the US together own nearly 90 percent of all nuclear weapons and the number of useable warheads they possessed in 2023 remained stable for the most part, according to the Swedish think tank. However, Russia is estimated to have deployed about 36 more warheads with operational forces than in January 2023. \u201cTransparency regarding nuclear forces has declined in both countries in the wake of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and debates around nuclear-sharing arrangements have increased in saliency,\u201d the Swedish think tank said. Russia and the US also possess more than 1,200 warheads each that have been previously retired from military service, and are gradually being dismantled, it said. The institute said despite \u201cpublic claims made in 2023\u201d that Russia had deployed nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, \u201cthere is no conclusive visual evidence that the actual deployment of warheads has taken place.\u201d The size of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal is estimated to have increased from 410 warheads in January 2023 to 500 in January 2024, \u201cand it is expected to keep growing,\u201d according to SIPRI. \u201cChina is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country,\u201d said Hans M. Kristensen, associate senior fellow with SIPRI\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program. \u201cBut in nearly all of the nuclear-armed states there are either plans or a significant push to increase nuclear forces.\u201d China could potentially have as many intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) as Russia or the US by the end of the decade, but Beijing\u2019s stockpile of nuclear warheads is expected to remain much smaller compared to their stockpiles. North Korea\u2019s military nuclear program continues to be \u201ca central element of its national security strategy,\u201d and SIPRI estimates the hermit kingdom possesses about 50 warheads and enough fissile material to reach up to 90 warheads, numbers that represent \u201csignificant increases over the estimates for January 2023.\u201d In 2023, North Korea appeared to have carried out its first test of a short-range ballistic missile from a rudimentary silo and completed the development of at least two types of land-attack cruise missile (LACM) designed to deliver nuclear weapons, according to SIPRI. \u201cLike several other nuclear-armed states, North Korea is putting new emphasis on developing its arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d said Matt Korda, Associate Researcher with SIPRI\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program. \u201cAccordingly, there is a growing concern that North Korea might intend to use these weapons very early in a conflict.\u201d Wars weaken diplomacy The Swedish think tank said the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have further weakened nuclear diplomacy on the global stage. In 2023 Russia suspended participation in the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START), the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty limiting Russian and US strategic nuclear forces, while in response the US also stopped sharing data. Moscow has continued to make threats involving the use of nuclear weapons in light of Western aid for Ukraine, and in May 2024 carried out tactical nuclear weapons drills close to the Ukrainian border, SIPRI said. \u201cWe have not seen nuclear weapons playing such a prominent role in international relations since the Cold War,\u201d said Wilfred Wan, the director of SIPRI\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program. \u201cIt is hard to believe that barely two years have passed since the leaders of the five largest nuclear-armed states jointly reaffirmed that \u2018a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\u2019,\u201d he said. Furthermore, an agreement between Iran and the US in June 2023 \u201cseemed to temporarily de-escalate tensions between the two countries,\u201d but the start of the Israel\u2013Hamas war in October \u201cupended the agreement, with proxy attacks by Iran-backed groups on US forces in Iraq and Syria apparently ending Iranian\u2013US diplomatic efforts,\u201d SIPRI said. The Israel\u2013Hamas war also \u201cundermined efforts\u201d to engage Israel in the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction, the think tank said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/world/nuclear-arsenals-strengthen-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

China\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that \u201cfour foreign teachers at Beihua University were attacked\u201d while visiting the park Monday morning \u2013 adding they were immediately taken to the hospital and did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner told CNN his brother, David Zabner, was one of the victims of the stabbing. Zabner said his brother, who was on his second visit to China with Cornell, is \u201cdoing well\u201d and has \u201cbeen stitched up and seems to be recovering,\u201d after speaking to him on Tuesday morning Beijing time. The other three victims survived the attack, Adam Zabner said, adding he could not comment on their health status. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely grateful that my brother is OK and that he survived this attack,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe hope of my family is to get my brother back home as soon as possible and get them healthy. And we really just want to thank the US State Department for all their help, and also our federal delegation from Iowa who have been particularly helpful.\u201d The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing incident in China and is monitoring the situation. \u2018Horrifying attack\u2019 Knife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled. The country has faced a spate of stabbing rampages in public places including schools and hospitals. But public attacks against foreigners are rare. The attack in Jilin comes as China has been seeking to draw back international visitors following three years of stringent Covid-19 border controls. It also comes amid efforts to boost educational exchanges with the United States as the two countries look to stabilize their fraught relationship. The incident has drawn attention and concern in Iowa from officials and lawmakers. Gov. Kim Reynolds called it a \u201chorrifying attack.\u201d US Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents the district where Cornell College is located, said the college employees \u201cwere brutally stabbed\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in our power to bring these Iowans home safely.\u201d On China\u2019s heavily censored social media, visuals and discussions about the attack had been swiftly erased since Monday. Censorship appeared to have relaxed somewhat by noon Tuesday to allow some comments to surface. Some Chinese internet users called it a \u201cterrible\u201d incident, while others questioned why Chinese media was not reporting on the attack. Some also expressed concerns about its potential impact on China\u2019s global image and the willingness of foreigners to visit the country, amid a rise in nationalism and anti-American sentiment. At its news conference Tuesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry sought to dismiss concerns that the attack would affect educational exchanges between China and the US. \u201cCarrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States is in the common interests of both sides and has received active support and response from various sectors in both countries,\u201d said Lin, the spokesperson. \u201cChina is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China has always taken effective measures and will continue to take relevant measures to effectively protect the safety of all foreigners in China.\u201d Study ties Cornell College began a partnership with Beihua University in 2018, which would see the Chinese institution provide funding for educators from the Iowa school to travel and live in China and teach a portion of a course in areas of computer science, math and physics over two-week periods, according to information posted on the college website at the time. China has been trying to boost its educational cooperation with the US, which has suffered considerable setbacks due to the Covid pandemic and bilateral tensions. During a visit to the US in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the country would invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years to foster personal ties between the two countries. The Chinese leader noted his own enduring ties to the state of Iowa in his announcement. Xi stayed with a host family in Iowa during his first visit to the US nearly four decades ago, an experience he has described as \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Last week, Xi encouraged universities in China and the US to \u201cstrengthen exchanges and cooperation,\u201d in a letter to the president of Kean University in New Jersey, which has a China-based joint venture with Wenzhou University, according to state media. China has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world, partly due to its strict gun controls and powerful mass surveillance. But it has continued to face mass stabbings in public places. In May, two people were killed and another 21 injured in a knife attack in a hospital in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning\u00a0stabbing incident\u00a0outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province. And a\u00a02022 stabbing, also at a kindergarten, killed three and injured six in eastern Jiangxi province. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported the wrong day for the stabbings.

{"id": "2024_06_17_australia_australia-china-cheng-lei-blocked-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese Premier Li Qiang\u2019s four-day visit to Australia this week was set to be focused on repairing long-strained relations between the two countries. But apparent efforts by Chinese officials to stand in front of an Australian reporter during a press briefing have shone a spotlight back on frictions between the countries. Cheng Lei, a TV anchor who was held in detention in China for more than three years before her release in 2023, told Sky News Australia the officials went to \u201cgreat lengths\u201d to block her from the cameras during a press event Monday where Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed cooperative agreements. Video footage appears to show two people involved in the incident, with one of them, described by the outlet as a Chinese embassy employee,\u00a0trying at one point to push closer to a seated Cheng, despite being blocked by another woman, identified by Sky News as an Australian official,\u00a0who intervenes to give her space. \u201cI\u2019m only guessing this is to prevent me from saying something or doing something that they think would be a bad look, but that in itself was a bad look,\u201d Cheng told Sky News, where she has been employed as a news presenter and columnist since late last year. Cheng added that such behavior was \u201ctypical\u201d as Chinese officials wouldn\u2019t want \u201cvoices of discord or the presence of someone who\u2019s a bit controversial\u201d when they are aiming to present a \u201cfriendly facade.\u201d Multiple media outlets that were also in attendance at the press conference, including the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph, reported the same details. CNN has requested comment from China\u2019s embassy in Canberra. China\u2019s security state keeps tight control on media and information within the country, where officials are not subject to the kind of robust questioning common to democratic countries. Beijing has also long been condemned by Western nations and rights groups for wrongful and arbitrary detentions. Cheng, previously a business anchor for China\u2019s state broadcaster CGTN, was detained by Chinese authorities in August 2020 on opaque espionage charges that came as diplomatic tensions were escalating between Beijing and Canberra. The mother of two spent more than three years in detention before being released by Beijing and returned home to her family in October, weeks before Albanese made the first visit of an Australian leader to China in seven years. Speaking to Sky News ahead of the news conference Monday, Cheng said it was a \u201cvery emotional day\u201d for her to be covering the major visit. \u201cSurely the fact that one minute I\u2019m sitting in incarceration and being raised as a topic at these visits then the next minute I\u2019m actually covering the visit \u2026 is testament to how wonderful freedom is and democracy is,\u201d she said. Cheng\u2019s detention had been a deep point of contention between the two governments, as has the jailing of writer and democracy activist Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen who earlier this year was handed a suspended death penalty sentence for espionage following years of detention. Yang has denied the charges, which rights groups have said are politically motivated. Albanese said he raised Yang\u2019s case with Li, but declined to give an update on the health of the democracy activist, who has said he fears he could die in jail due to health issues. When asked during a press conference later about Cheng being blocked from view by officials during the document signing, Albanese said he didn\u2019t see the incident described but added it was \u201cimportant that people be allowed to participate fully and that\u2019s what should happen in this building or anywhere else in Australia.\u201d Pandas and visas The situation Monday stands as a stark reminder of Beijing-Canberra tensions and deep concerns within Australia, a staunch US ally, about China\u2019s authoritarianism amid a trip that was otherwise meant to instill goodwill. The\u00a0four-day visit of Li, China\u2019s No. 2 official, to Australia is the highest-level trip to a US-allied country of any Chinese official in seven years. It comes as the two countries have made strides in mending deep tensions over issues of trade, security and Beijing\u2019s alleged political influence in Australia and the South Pacific. Speaking alongside Li following the signing ceremony, Albanese called the visit \u201canother important step in stabilizing\u201d the relationship. The Chinese premier, speaking via a translator, pledged that China would work with Australia in \u201ca spirit of mutual respect, seeking common ground while showing differences and mutual benefit.\u201d Li announced Sunday that China would provide a new pair of giant pandas to the Adelaide Zoo in southern Australian after its current pair return to China later this year \u2013 extending a classic gesture of friendship from China often called \u201cpanda diplomacy.\u201d China would also\u00a0add Australia to its visa-waiver program, Li said Monday. Details were not immediately announced but follow similar visa arrangements with other countries in recent months as China struggles to draw in more international tourists to boost its flagging economy following years of Covid-19 border restrictions. Li announced a waiver scheme for New Zealand during a visit there Friday. The two leaders agreed to greater military-to-military communication, according to Albanese. The agreement follows recent close encounters of the two powers. In May, a Chinese fighter jet fired flares into the path of an Australian helicopter over the Yellow Sea in a move Albanese condemned at the time as \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d Li\u2019s Australia visit comes as China has gradually rolled back a number of crippling trade controls that it placed on key Australian imports including beef, barley, timber, coal and wine from 2020 after\u00a0then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in China.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/australia/australia-china-cheng-lei-blocked-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_europe_meloni-macron-italy-france-abortion-g7-intl", "text": "The crowning document from a meeting of G7 leaders in Italy has been released with a veiled reference to abortion after French President Emmanuel Macron clashed with Italy\u2019s prime minister over the specific language to include on abortion rights. The Group of Seven\u2019s summit declaration on Friday referred to \u201ccomprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all\u201d but did not include the word\u00a0\u201cabortion\u201d itself \u2013 a contrast to the group\u2019s previous communique, released after the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, which called explicitly for \u201caccess to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care.\u201d American officials said US President Joe Biden pushed to keep in language about reproductive rights after the summit host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia\u00a0Meloni, sought to strip some language from the document. Friday\u2019s communique appeared to be a diplomatic solution, with the statement endorsing the Hiroshima text without reproducing it. The document emphasizes the seven nations\u2019 \u201ccommitments in the Hiroshima Leaders\u2019 Communiqu\u00e9 to universal access to adequate,\u00a0affordable, and quality health services for women, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive\u00a0health and rights for all,\u201d the communique reads. The annual gathering\u2019s communique sets out the bloc\u2019s values and agenda for the year ahead. Several previous summits\u2019 communiques have also stopped short of using the word \u201cabortion,\u201d calling instead for access to sexual and reproductive health services. \u2018I regret it, but I respect it\u2019 Negotiations over this year\u2019s language caused a public clash on the sidelines of the summit between Meloni and Macron. Asked by an Italian journalist on Thursday how he felt about a G7 statement \u201cwithout the word abortion,\u201d Macron said he regretted Rome\u2019s position. \u201cFrance shares this vision of equality between men and women. It is not a vision that is shared by all the political spectrum. I regret it but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people,\u201d he said. France intends to \u201cdefend with force\u201d the right to abortion, he added. Meloni defended her conservative government\u2019s position on Thursday, and accused Macron of playing politics, days after he called\u00a0snap parliamentary elections\u00a0in France for later this month. \u201cThere is no reason to argue about issues on which we have already agreed for some time. I believe it is profoundly wrong, in difficult times like these, to campaign using a precious forum like the G7,\u201d Meloni told reporters Thursday. The bloc has used the past two summits primarily to stress its support for Ukraine as the country tries to repel Russia\u2019s invasion and show it remains undivided in the face of resurgent global threats. But, coming swiftly after European parliamentary elections which saw far-right parties make gains in several countries \u2013 and ahead of the United States presidential election in November \u2013 national political issues have intruded on this summit more than in previous years. Biden, who has made protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid, had pushed to ensure that an endorsement of the Hiroshima statement would be in the communique, according to US officials on Thursday. \u201cThe president felt very strongly that we need to have at the very least the language that references what we did in Hiroshima on women\u2019s health and reproductive rights,\u201d a senior US administration official said. The issue of abortion has become particularly febrile in the US since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a decision made possible by a solid six-member conservative majority, including three judges nominated by former President Donald Trump. In Italy, however, where Meloni\u2019s conservative platform helped propel her party to power in 2022, she has largely toed the G7\u2019s line on geopolitical issues \u2013 while pushing hard-right policies domestically. She has previously called abortion a \u201ctragedy,\u201d surrogacy \u201cinhuman\u201d and has removed lesbian mothers\u2019 names from their children\u2019s birth certificates. Francesco Lollobrigida, Meloni\u2019s brother-in-law, informal spokesman and Italy\u2019s agriculture minister, suggested the reason Meloni feels so strongly about this issue was because the Pope has been present at the summit. The clash between Meloni and Macron comes after France in March became the world\u2019s first country to enshrine abortion rights in its constitution, the culmination of an effort which began in direct response to the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to roll back abortion rights in America. \u201cFrance integrated this right of women to an abortion, the freedom to have control over one\u2019s body within this institution. The same sensibility is not shared in your country today,\u201d Macron said at the summit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/europe/meloni-macron-italy-france-abortion-g7-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Since January, North Korean soldiers have been setting mines and installing structures that appear to be anti-tank barriers at various locations along the\u00a0demilitarized zone (DMZ) that splits the Koreas, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). A number of the North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded by land mine explosions,\u00a0the JCS said in a statement, without providing more details on the casualties. The South Korean military is closely monitoring the North\u2019s military activities on the border, it added. The report comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ramped up fiery rhetoric and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea. In recent weeks, hundreds of trash-filled ballons launched from the North have landed in the South, while the government in Seoul resumed loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border. Last week, Kim\u2019s sister and Pyongyang spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned the resumption of the broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation,\u201d saying South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d\u00a0from the North if it continued with the action and failed to prevent activists from\u00a0sending anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border. The 160-mile-long DMZ was created at the end of the Korean War in 1953, cutting the Korean Peninsula roughly in two under a deal between\u00a0North Korea and China on one side and the collection of Western allies on the other known as the United Nations Command. But a formal peace treaty was never signed, leaving the two Koreas technically in a state of war. And the DMZ has since become one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world, ringed by miles of barbed wire and land mines and patrolled by soldiers from both sides for decades. In its statement Tuesday, the JCS said North Korean troops have also been removing railway rails and lamp posts along roads approaching the border under orders from Kim Jong Un. Analysis is\u00a0needed to determine whether the measures are aimed at solidifying the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) that runs down the center of the DMZ as an official border between the two Koreas, according to the JCS. It said the measures are also an effort by North Korea to strengthen internal controls, such as blocking North Korean residents and troops from defecting to South Korea. Separately, South Korean troops fired warning shots after North Korean soldiers working in the DMZ briefly crossed into the South on Tuesday in the second such incident in less than two weeks, the JCS said. Around 20 to 30 North Korean soldiers carrying work tools crossed the MDL within the DMZ at around 8:30 a.m. local time, according to the JCS. They returned to the North after the South fired warning shots and broadcast warnings via loudspeakers, the JCS said, adding that the incursion appeared to have been \u201caccidental,\u201d with no unusual activity detected after the North Korean troops\u2019 retreat.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/asia/north-korean-troops-dmz-landmind-casualties-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_france-far-right-macron-analysis-intl", "text": "Alliances brokered and canceled, leaders defenestrated and besieged, and cries of \u201cbetrayal\u201d and \u201cshame\u201d echoing across the airwaves:\u00a0It was almost Shakespearean. This week saw the wildest week France\u2019s right-wing has had in decades. The saga began Sunday night, with a stunning victory\u00a0for the far right\u00a0in European\u00a0parliamentary\u00a0elections, bagging some 40% of the vote\u00a0in France. French President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u00a0promptly turned the country on its head by announcing a snap\u00a0legislative\u00a0election. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to give the keys to the far right in 2027 (in France\u2019s next presidential election),\u201d he said this week in justifying his huge gamble on the surprise vote. After topping the European poll, there\u2019s been widespread speculation that\u00a0the\u00a0National Rally,\u00a0the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen\u00a0and her youthful acolyte Jordan Bardella, could at least become the kingmaker of the country\u2019s next government, if not lead it, unseating Macron\u2019s own centrist bloc. Macron is safe as president until 2027, but he\u2019s facing the possibility of a government led and staffed by far-right ministers: hardly calm-inducing thoughts for him. But the far right\u2019s success has thrown the French political right off balance, with almost comic results. Within days, one leader on the right would be barricaded inside his HQ, another abandoned by all but one of his newly elected lawmakers. In the struggle for favor with the far right, the knives were out. Locked inside Fast forward to Tuesday, and\u00a0Eric\u00a0Ciotti, president of The Republicans \u2013 long the main party on France\u2019s political right \u2013 announced a surprise coalition with Le Pen\u2019s far-right party. His thinking, as outlined,\u00a0was measured: \u201cThe country has never been so right-wing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country expects right-wing actions.\u201d The reaction from his colleagues was anything but. \u201cSelling your soul for a plate of lentils and making it look like the country\u2019s best interest,\u201d was how his\u00a0fellow\u00a0Republican Valerie Pecresse\u00a0put it. Cries of \u201cshame\u201d were slung towards him from other past and present\u00a0Republican\u00a0colleagues online. After decades in the traditional mainstream, which prided itself on the\u00a0so-called\u00a0\u201ccordon sanitaire\u201d protecting the seats of French power from the far right via tactical alliances, The Republicans, led by Ciotti, found themselves on the periphery,\u00a0winning just over\u00a07% of the vote.\u00a0\u00a0 With the far right on the rise, Ciotti saw a path to relevance. His party disagreed. In the maelstrom of outrage at his \u201cdeal with the devil\u201d (as the French President termed it), party figures called to excommunicate him from the party. His defiance will go down in French political history:\u00a0locking himself inside\u00a0the party\u2019s headquarters to try\u00a0to\u00a0stymie them. Cue a procession of party leaders marching to unseat him. Most memorable was\u00a0president of the Paris area\u2019s regional council,\u00a0theatrically rolling up her sleeves\u00a0amid\u00a0a swarm of journalists as she advanced on Ciotti\u2019s holdout. Meanwhile, francophone social media was ablaze with memes depicting police SWAT teams or hostage negotiators ousting Ciotti. The reality was a little less climactic: His colleagues found spare keys to unlock the door. By Wednesday evening, Ciotti had been\u00a0kicked out\u00a0of the party, with\u00a0its\u00a0secretary general blasting the \u201cunholy alliance\u201d with the far right,\u00a0echoing\u00a0Macron\u2019s own attack. But the now supposedly ex-leader of the party went down swinging, issuing a\u00a0press statement\u00a0in the name of\u00a0The Republicans\u00a0condemning the leadership meeting as illegitimate and \u201cwith no legal standing.\u201d \u201cI am and remain the president of our political formation, elected by our members,\u201d he posted on X, formerly Twitter. On\u00a0Thursday\u00a0morning, he tweeted\u00a0a video\u00a0of himself sitting at his desk,\u00a0overlaid with a dramatic Hollywood-esque soundtrack: an overt rejection\u00a0of\u00a0his ousting from the party. This would-be coup did the 21st\u00a0century proud: The putschists apparently had the party\u2019s X account in their grip, Ciotti loyalists the party\u2019s Facebook, the accounts posting conflicting statements as to the party\u2019s leadership. Vindication for Ciotti came Friday, as a French court ruled his ouster illegal. \u201cJustice has spoken,\u201d he said following the verdict, \u201cshe said you can\u2019t do whatever you want, you can\u2019t do DIY.\u201d Meanwhile, at stage right\u00a0\u2026 Further right on the French political spectrum, chaos was also the order of the day, often playing out on national TV screens. Spearheaded by Le Pen\u2019s niece, Executive Vice President\u00a0Marion Marechal, and former TV pundit Eric\u00a0Zemmour, the Reconquest party clung to the coattails of National Rally, taking some 5% of the European\u00a0parliamentary\u00a0election vote in France.\u00a0The party was only founded in 2021. Like Ciotti, keen to ride the far-right wave of popularity to government,\u00a0Marechal had\u00a0since Sunday\u00a0been working towards\u00a0forming\u00a0a formal partnership with her aunt\u2019s party. Zemmour seemed to disagree, his shock at Marechal\u2019s efforts clear on his face when she announced them on national TV\u00a0on Sunday night. Apparently\u00a0frustrated with his opposition, she went rogue, telling Reconquest supporters to vote for their far-right competitors. \u201cLet\u2019s put the interests of France before those of the party,\u201d she said on live TV. Zemmour was furious. Later that day, in a television interview\u00a0with BFMTV, he slammed her as a liar. \u201cShe\u2019s beaten the world record for betrayal,\u201d he said. Next, he took an axe to her ties to his party, declaring Marechal, and the newly elected three European lawmakers that supported her, exiled from the party. Zemmour now cuts a lonely figure, left with one single member of the European Parliament, a pariah even\u00a0within\u00a0the far-right. \u201cI am distressed to have to comment on these internal quarrels at a time when our country is dying, at a time when hope can finally be reborn,\u201d he lamented on X. In his statement on X, formerly Twitter, he refuted\u00a0Marechal\u2019s\u00a0accusations that he had sunk a deal with National Rally. France leaning right? In the wake of this chaos,\u00a0Wednesday ended with one party divorced from its leader after declaring an alliance and another leader left with only a single\u00a0European\u00a0lawmaker for failing to do the same. Less than two weeks out from the\u00a0legislative\u00a0election,\u00a0called for June 30,\u00a0it\u2019s unclear how much this right-wing wrangling will affect national results. Certainly, it plays well for Le Pen and\u00a0Bardella\u2019s National Rally. They are the unchallenged electoral muscle on the right and have so far managed to stay above the fray. The fact of Ciotti\u2019s endorsement, even if rejected by others in his traditionalist party, indicates how far National Rally has moved into mainstream politics. Outwardly, National Rally\u2019s transformation from extremists to ballot card favorites, for at least a substantial portion of French voters,\u00a0is complete.

{"id": "2024_06_17_india_india-west-bengal-train-crash-kanchanjunga-express-intl-hnk", "text": "At least nine people were killed and dozens of others injured after a cargo train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, according to authorities, as a top official ordered a major emergency response. The Kanchenjunga Express, which runs between\u00a0the city of Kolkata and Silchar in northeastern Assam state, was struck by a freight train south of the city of Siliguri, according to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Disaster teams have rushed to the crash location, which lies below the foothills that lead to Darjeeling, a popular mountain tourist destination famous for its tea plantations and stunning Himalayan views. Local media pictures and video footage\u00a0from the scene showed at least one train car on its side, parts of it crushed into a mass of twisted metal. Another car can be seen rising into the air at a steep angle above an engine carriage. \u201cEight people were brought dead to the hospital and one patient who was in a very serious condition succumbed to his injuries overnight,\u201d Sanjay Mallick, the medical superintendent of the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, told CNN. A total of 52 patients have been admitted to the hospital, he added. Banerjee wrote on X that \u201cdoctors, ambulances and disaster teams have been rushed to the site for rescue, recovery, medical assistance.\u201d \u201cAction on war-footing initiated,\u201d she added. Live images from the site of the crash streamed live by local news channel TV 9 showed people gathered outside the carriages, some filming on their phones. The crash comes more than a year after India experienced one of the worst train disasters in the country\u2019s history, when more than 280 people were killed in a three-way collision involving two passenger trains and a freight train in eastern Odisha state. That incident shocked the nation, renewing calls for authorities to confront safety issues in a railway system that transports more than 13 million passengers every day. India\u2019s extensive rail network, one of the largest in the world, was built more than 160 years ago under British colonial rule. Today, it runs about 11,000 trains every day over 67,000 miles of tracks in the world\u2019s\u00a0most populous nation. But decaying infrastructure is often cited as a cause for traffic delays and numerous train accidents. Though\u00a0government statistics show that accidents and derailments have been on the decline in recent years, they are still tragically common. More than 16,000 people were killed in nearly 18,000 railway accidents across the country in 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Most railway accidents were due to falls from trains and collisions between trains and people on the track. Train-on-train collisions are less common. On Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the West Bengal crash \u201csaddening\u201d and sent a message of condolence to the affected families. \u201cI pray that the injured recover at the earliest. Spoke to officials and took stock of the situation. Rescue operations are underway to assist the affected,\u201d Modi wrote on X. Upgrading India\u2019s transportation infrastructure is a key priority for Modi in his push to create a\u00a0$5 trillion economy by 2025.\u00a0His government last year raised capital spending on airports, road and highway construction and other infrastructure projects to $122 billion, or 1.7% of its GDP. A significant portion of that spending is targeted at introducing more high-speed trains to India\u2019s notoriously slow railways.

{"id": "travel_bird-strike-plane-what-happens", "text": "Late Monday night, Virgin Australia flight VA 148 set out from Queenstown in New Zealand bound for Melbourne. Not long after takeoff, the right engine of the Boeing 737-800 jet started\u00a0emitting loud bangs, followed by flames. The pilot flew on with the remaining engine, bringing the plane\u2019s 73 passengers and crew to a safe emergency landing at nearby Invercargill airport. Virgin Australia says the dramatic turn of events was caused by a \u201cpossible bird strike\u201d. Queenstown Airport\u00a0played down\u00a0the likelihood of bird strike, saying \u201cno birds were detected on the airfield at that time\u201d. While we don\u2019t know exactly what happened, bird strike is a common and real risk for aircraft. It can damage planes, and even lead to deaths. How common are bird strikes? A bird strike is a\u00a0collision between\u00a0an aircraft and a bird. (Though the definition is sometimes expanded to include\u00a0collisions on the ground\u00a0with land animals including deer, rabbits, dogs and alligators.) The\u00a0first bird strike\u00a0was recorded by Orville Wright in 1905, over a cornfield in Ohio. Now they happen every day, with some seasonal variability due to the\u00a0migratory patterns\u00a0of birds. Perhaps the most famous migratory bird strike occurred in 2009, when\u00a0US Airways Flight 1549\u00a0encountered a flock of migrating Canadian geese shortly after taking off from LaGuardia Airport in New York. Both of the plane\u2019s engines failed, and captain Sully Sullenberger was forced to pilot it to an unpowered landing in the Hudson River. Between 2008 and 2017, the Australian Transport Safety Board recorded\u00a016,626 bird strikes. In America, the Federal Aviation Administration reported\u00a017,200 bird strikes\u00a0in 2022 alone. Where do bird strikes happen, and what are the effects? According to the\u00a0International Civil Aviation Organization, 90% of bird strikes happen near airports. In general, this is while aircraft are taking off or landing, or flying at lower altitudes where most bird activity occurs. The effect of bird strike depends on many factors including the type of aircraft. Outcomes may include shutting down an engine, as may have happened with the Virgin Australia flight. This plane was a Boeing 737-800, which has the capability to fly on a single engine to an alternate airport. In smaller aircraft, particularly single-engine aircraft, bird strikes can be fatal. Since 1988,\u00a0262 bird strike fatalities\u00a0have been reported globally, and 250 aircraft destroyed. How do manufacturers and pilots defend against bird strike? Most\u00a0bird strikes\u00a0occur early in the morning or a sunset when birds are most active. Pilots are trained to be vigilant during these times. Radar can be used to\u00a0track flocks of birds. However, this technology is ground-based and not available worldwide so it can\u2019t be used everywhere. The two largest manufacturers of passenger jets, Boeing and Airbus, use\u00a0turbofan engines. These use a series of fan blades to compress air before adding fuel and flame to get the thrust needed to take off. Bird strike in one of these engines can cause severe damage to the fan blades, causing the engine to fail. Engine manufacturers test the safety of these engines by firing\u00a0a high-speed frozen chicken\u00a0at them while the engine is operating at full thrust. The Australian Government\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority\u00a0circular on wildlife hazard management\u00a0outlines what airports should do to keep birds and animals away from the vicinity of the airport. One technique is to use small gas explosions to mimic the sound of a shotgun to deter birds from loitering near the runway. In areas with high bird populations, airports may also use certain grasses and plants that do not attract the birds.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/bird-strike-plane-what-happens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_style_new-chinese-style-gen-z-intl-hnk", "text": "What\u2019s old is new again. This time it\u2019s a centuries-old skirt design that\u2019s proving popular in China. The \u201cmamianqun\u201d or \u201chorse face skirt\u201d is being worn in cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu as young people in China are giving the attire a modern twist, with unconventional pairings and choice of fabrics. While once the sole purview of \u201chanfu\u201d enthusiasts (a renaissance of the ancient clothing traditionally worn by ethnic-majority Han Chinese before the Qing dynasty) and reserved for special occasions, the pleated often brocade skirts have become a part of everyday wear. The popularity of the skirt has been wrapped into a broader trend being dubbed \u201cxinzhongshi,\u201d or \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d \u2014 which merges all manner of contemporary design with traditional Chinese aesthetics, applied to everything from clothing to furniture. While the idea isn\u2019t new, and was once considered old-fashioned, the wide-ranging term is being used as a marketing tool on China\u2019s lucrative e-commerce platforms, with retailers quick to turn Gen Z\u2019s patriotic, and at times, nationalistic sentiments, for profit. On Chinese social media platforms Weibo and Xiaohongshu, searches for \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d and \u201cnew Chinese style outfits\u201d hashtags exceeded 100 million in early April, according to state news agency Xinhua. Besides fashion, the posts show everything from stuffed leather armchairs with the curves of traditional Chinese wood furniture to mobile phone wallpapers of landscape paintings. The state-backed China National Textile and Apparel Council estimates the market size of \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d clothing reached 1 billion yuan (nearly 138 million dollars) in 2023. On Xiaohongshu, a 33-year-old user, who goes by the handle Momo and didn\u2019t give her real name for privacy reasons, frequently gives tips on how to style Chinese clothing. In one post, she demonstrated how you can top an oversized pink sweatshirt with a black mamianqun, pairing it with a matching baseball cap and sneakers. \u201cMore and more young people are willing to use traditional culture as a new way to express their attitudes. That\u2019s a good thing and very cool,\u201d she told CNN in a text message. It\u2019s mostly young people following the trend, agrees Huang Weizhe, a 32-year-old designer and manager of local fashion brand Longfuji. On social media, Huang shares ways to dress in \u201cnew Chinese style,\u201d and in one post wears a loose silk shirt with jeans. \u201cThere is no set rule in the \u2018new Chinese style\u2019 (trend) that you must follow, so it is more inclusive. This is the style that young people like now,\u201d he told CNN over the phone. Riding the \u2018new\u2019 Chinese style wave Fashion designers like Samuel Gui Yang, whose collections have long taken inspiration from Chinese heritage, are seeing more interest from mainland China turn to their brands due to the \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d trend. But unlike the mamianqun, which is a literal nod to the past \u2013 and being mass produced \u2013 his 9-year-old brand has been about bridging the gap \u201cbetween Shanghai and London\u201d and drawing from the rich tapestry of what it means to be Chinese, in China and abroad. \u201cI think my wider audience (is) really a fan of\u2026the way we bring in this \u2018Chineseness\u2019 (the) heritage details in a more subtle way,\u201d he said in a phone interview. For Yang, the aesthetics and themes of Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee\u2019s 1994 movie \u201cEat Drink Man Woman\u201d represent his idea of what \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d should be. The film about the lives of a master chef and his three daughters navigating the tensions between modernity and traditions, personal freedom and family. Yang said, \u201csubtly reflects the lifestyle of Chinese people, especially the direct connection between a dinner table and interpersonal relationships.\u201d The film, he added, \u201cprovides us with a lot of inspiration for our design journey,\u201d and that he always draws from the \u201c80s and 90s Asian dressing style.\u201d There\u2019s the Lee denim jacket inspired by Hong Kong martial arts and film star Bruce Lee and the Ailing dress, named after Shanghai-born American novelist Eileen Chang. At Shanghai Fashion Week this March, he showcased a long-sleeved bias cut qipao with roll-up sleeves (pictured top), giving the classic silhouette a fresh update. For Ian Hylton, designer and decades-long China resident, \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d is a misnomer. His eponymous menswear label draws heavily on Chinese dress styles and design motifs \u2013 think elegant loose silk mandarin collar shirts, Tang puffer jackets and cashmere coats with button knots. \u201cI\u2019m kind of not a fan of this term \u2018new Chinese style,\u2019 because to me that\u2019s like saying new French clothes, new Italian clothes,\u201d Hylton told CNN over the phone. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new. There\u2019s a new way to approach it, but it\u2019s somehow being treated like a trend, like short or long skirts. They\u2019re part of a culture, they\u2019re the fabric and makeup of a culture.\u201d Hylton\u2019s wife, Min Liu, launched her own Chinese-aesthetics inspired label Ms. Min in 2010, a reaction, he said, to the fact that most people in the country weren\u2019t wearing Chinese clothes. Hylton is the company\u2019s president. \u201cWhen I arrived in China\u2026there was not a billboard, there was not an advertisement, there was not an anything that featured a Chinese person,\u201d said Hylton, who moved to China in 2005 as the creative director of luxury fashion label Ports 1961. \u201cEverything was a foreign face\u2026everything that was foreign was good and everything that was local was disrespected.\u201d The tides he believes have turned in the last decade or so with young Chinese becoming more aware and confident of their place in the world, and embracing China\u2019s culture and history. Domestic fashion labels also saw a boost during the pandemic, as strict travel restrictions prevented mainland Chinese from buying luxury goods abroad. Meanwhile Momo, the Xiaohongshu user, said the popularity of \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d has been down to \u201cserious commercialization,\u201d which she doesn\u2019t necessarily buy into. Douyin, China\u2019s TikTok released a report in March showing a 841% increase in the sale of the mamianqun skirts that typically retail for around 200 yuan (roughly US$28), on its e-commerce platform compared to the year before. State broadcaster CCTV reported that Cao county in Shandong province, which it said accounts for around half of the country\u2019s mamianqun production, sold 550 million yuan (almost $76 million) worth of skirts in the first two months of the year, a surge attributed to the run-up of the Lunar New Year holiday. But some of the \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d products are \u201cshoddily made\u201d she said, though she thinks that their designs will improve with time. Regardless of trends, Momo said she will continue to teach her 33,000 followers how to wear traditional clothing as much as possible \u2013 out and about, to study and to work. \u201cWhenever we wear \u2018new Chinese style\u2019 or hanfu and mamianqun, it\u2019s a way we can invite more people, including those around the world, to understand (our) culture.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/style/new-chinese-style-gen-z-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_weather_us-fathers-day-heat-wave-climate-sunday", "text": "The year\u2019s most significant heat wave so far is expected to roast a large portion of the central and southern United States on Father\u2019s Day Sunday with potentially record-breaking high temperatures, four days away from summer\u2019s official start. The National Weather Service warned people in the South and Midwest planning to celebrate dads outdoors on Sunday to stay cool amid a major heat risk, with high temperatures into the 90s in some areas. The intense heat wave won\u2019t stop there. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome will build Sunday over the East and stretch into the Midwest and Great Lakes over the next few days, with the heat expected to persist through the week. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The final Sunday of spring will be a scorcher in the Plains and Midwest, where temperatures will reach the mid- to upper 90s, according to the Weather Prediction Center. People living across the Great Lakes region can expect temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s. The Mississippi River Valley will be slammed with the worst of Sunday\u2019s sweltering conditions, with large portions of both states facing a Level 3 \u2013 or major \u2013 risk of heat-related impacts. The National Weather Service office in St. Louis encouraged residents to take extra precautions Sunday for its hottest day of the year. \u201cIt will feel like 100-105 during the afternoon hours. We aren\u2019t used to this kind of heat yet,\u201d forecasters wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Sunday\u2019s unrelenting heat will be felt across states including Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the weather service. Some smaller pockets of Level 4 \u2013 or extreme \u2013 heat will be felt in a few locations such as Atlanta, where Sunday afternoon temperatures could reach 94 degrees by the afternoon. Millions will face heat-related health risks as conditions reach extreme levels into this week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heat is the\u00a0deadliest form of weather\u00a0in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. Persistent heat could break records this week The extreme temperatures and uncomfortable heat will seep into the larger cities of the Midwest and Northeast by the start of the workweek. On Monday, Chicago temperatures could hit 94 degrees with the heat index at 97 degrees, according to forecasters at Chicago\u2019s weather service office. The high temperatures for the Upper Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions will soar into the mid- and upper 90s on Monday, with the possibility of tying or breaking numerous records, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The potential for record-shattering heat will last across the Ohio Valley and the Northeast through Friday, with some areas hitting heat indices of 105 degrees, the Weather Prediction Center said. A Level 3 heat risk is expected to affect large portions of states including Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on Monday, according to the weather service. Meanwhile, much of the southern half of Iowa faces an extreme heat risk on Monday. Weather service forecasters in Des Moines, Iowa, warned of high heat and humidity through Tuesday as temperatures push into the 90s and heat index values hit near-triple digits. \u201cMorning lows will be just as impressive, as temperatures remain in the mid- to even upper 70s,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said. \u201cThe combination of heat, humidity and little overnight relief will bring potentially widespread, significant heat-related impacts to anyone without adequate hydration or reliable cooling,\u201d according to the center. In Detroit, where daytime temperatures are expected to hit the high 90s, the city\u2019s urban core won\u2019t see much relief after dark, where weather service forecasters say overnight lows will only dip to the 70s this week. The sweltering conditions will continue to shift into the eastern and northeastern US by Tuesday.

The tourist had last been seen Tuesday at a cafe in the company of two female tourists who have since left the island. No further details about the victim, including a name or hometown, were immediately available. Mathraki, which has a population of 100, is a 3.9-square-kilometer (1.2-square-mile) heavily wooded island, west of the better-known island of Corfu.

A 74-year-old\u00a0Dutch tourist\u00a0was found by a fire department drone on Saturday lying face down in a ravine about 300 meters (330 yards) from the spot where he was last observed last Sunday, walking with some difficulty in the blistering heat. Dr.\u00a0Michael Mosley, a noted British television presenter and author, was found dead last Sunday on the island of Symi.

Gershkovich, 32, has been imprisoned since he was arrested while on a reporting trip in March last year by the FSB, Russia\u2019s federal security service, which accused him of trying to obtain state secrets. Gershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have vehemently denied the charges against him. The Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s office said last Thursday it had approved the indictment and referred Gershkovich\u2019s case to a trial court. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. The case will be heard in the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, TASS reported Monday. A US State Department spokesperson said Monday the US was concerned about reports the trial would be held behind closed doors, but said members of the US Embassy in Russia would try to go to it anyway. \u201cWe will try to attend the trial, as we try to attend the trial of any American citizens who are detained in Russia, but ultimately I don\u2019t have an answer for you yet whether that\u2019s going to be possible,\u201d said the spokesperson Matthew Miller told a press briefing. Miller said the US would continue to try to free Gershkovich as well as fellow wrongfully detained US citizen and former Marine Paul Whelan. For more than a year since his arrest,\u00a0Gershkovich\u00a0has been imprisoned in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times. The trial venue of Yekaterinburg is more than 1,100 miles east of the capital. Miller said he did not know if Gershkovich had yet been moved from Lefortovo to Yekaterinburg. Last week, Russian prosecutors said the FSB had \u201cestablished and documented\u201d that Gershkovich was acting on CIA instructions in the month he was arrested, alleging he had \u201ccollected secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. \u201cGershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d it said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_13_tech_apple-ai-data-openai-artificial-intelligence", "text": "Apple\u2019s splashy announcement at its Worldwide Developers Conference this week that it\u2019s adding artificial intelligence to its products, and partnering with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has raised many questions about how Apple\u2019s AI offerings will work. The confusion is understandable. Apple is simultaneously launching a proprietary suite of AI models while also integrating ChatGPT into its devices and software. So it\u2019s natural to wonder where one ends and the other begins and \u2014 perhaps more pressingly \u2014 what both companies will do with the personal information they receive from users. The stakes are particularly high for Apple, a company that has made security and privacy a hallmark of its brand. Here\u2019s what we know. The difference between Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT If Apple has its own AI, why does it need ChatGPT? The answer is that each is meant to do different things. Apple Intelligence \u2014 the collective brand name for all of Apple\u2019s own AI tools \u2014 is intended to be more of a personal assistant than anything else, with an emphasis on \u201cpersonal.\u201d It takes in specific information about your relationships and contacts, messages and emails you\u2019ve sent, events you\u2019ve been to, meetings on your calendar and other highly individualized bits of data about your life. And then it uses that data to, Apple hopes, make your life a little easier \u2014 helping you dig up a photo you took from that concert years ago, finding the right attachment to put on an email, or ranking your mobile notifications by priority and urgency. But while Apple Intelligence might know that you went on a hiking trip last year, it will lack what company executives called \u201cworld knowledge\u201d \u2014 more general information about history, current events and other things that are less directly linked to you. That\u2019s where ChatGPT comes in. Users will be able to have Siri forward questions and prompts to ChatGPT \u2014\u00a0on an opt-in basis \u2014 or have ChatGPT help you write documents within Apple apps. Apple said it plans to integrate with other third-party AI models eventually, too. The integration essentially removes a step to accessing ChatGPT and gives Apple users a more seamless onramp to that platform. What does this mean for my data? Since Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT will be used for largely different purposes, the amount and type of information users send to each AI may be different, too. Apple Intelligence will have access to a wide range of your personal data, from your written communications to photos and videos you\u2019ve taken to a record of your calendar events. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to prevent Apple Intelligence from accessing this information, short of not using its features; an Apple spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions on that topic. ChatGPT won\u2019t necessarily or automatically have access to your highly personal details, although you might choose to share some of this data and more with OpenAI if you decide to use ChatGPT through Apple. In Monday\u2019s demo, Apple showed Siri asking the user for permission to send a prompt to ChatGPT before doing so. As part of its agreement with Apple, OpenAI made an important concession: OpenAI agreed not to store any prompts from Apple users or to collect their IP addresses \u2014 though all bets are off if you consciously decide to log in and connect an existing ChatGPT account. Some users might\u00a0choose to do\u00a0that\u00a0to take advantage of their ChatGPT history or the benefits associated with ChatGPT\u2019s paid account plans. Should you trust Apple with your data? Now that we\u2019ve established what OpenAI will and won\u2019t do with your data, what about Apple? While Apple users will have to send their personal information and AI queries to OpenAI if they want to use ChatGPT, Apple has said that most of the time Apple Intelligence won\u2019t be sending user data anywhere. As much as possible, Apple will try to process AI prompts directly on your device using smaller AI models. This is similar to how Apple already processes FaceID and other sensitive data \u2014 the idea being that processing data right on the device limits risky exposure. Your data can\u2019t be intercepted or hacked from a central server if it never actually goes anywhere. In the event your AI task needs more processing power, Apple Intelligence will send your query and data to a cloud computing platform controlled by Apple, where a more capable AI model will fulfill the request. This is where Apple claims it has achieved a major privacy breakthrough. The company\u2019s announcement received relatively little airtime during its jam-packed Monday keynote but the company is plainly proud of the advancement it\u2019s clearly been extensively planning. Apple said Monday it has developed a new way to do cloud computing that means Apple can run computations on sensitive data while ensuring that nobody, not even the company itself, can tell what data is being processed or what computation is being done. Known as Private Cloud Compute, Apple\u2019s new architecture borrows certain hardware and security concepts from the iPhone, including the secure enclave that already protects sensitive user data on Apple mobile devices. With Private Cloud Compute, \u201cyour data is never stored or made accessible to Apple,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s SVP of software engineering, during Monday\u2019s keynote. After fulfilling a user\u2019s AI request, Private Cloud Compute scrubs itself of any user data involved in the process, Apple said. Apple claims Private Cloud Compute\u00a0is \u201conly possible\u201d because of the tight control it has over its entire technology ecosystem \u2014 from the specialized, proprietary computer chips to the software tying everything together. If it\u2019s true that Apple can\u2019t see the personal data that its large AI models are crunching \u2014 a claim Apple invited researchers to test for themselves because the system\u2019s design is meant to be scrutinized \u2014 then that sets Apple\u2019s implementation apart from that of other companies. For example, when you use ChatGPT, OpenAI discloses that it uses your data to further train its AI models. With Private Cloud Compute, you theoretically won\u2019t have to take Apple\u2019s word that it doesn\u2019t use your data for AI training. What about Apple\u2019s training data? Apple\u2019s AI models didn\u2019t spring up out of nowhere. They had to be trained, too, just like models offered by other companies. And that raises questions about whose data Apple used, and how. In a technical document released this week, Apple said its models are trained \u201con licensed data, including data selected to enhance specific features.\u201d \u201cWe never use our users\u2019 private personal data or user interactions when training our foundation models,\u201d the company added, \u201cand we apply filters to remove personally identifiable information like social security and credit card numbers that are publicly available on the Internet.\u201d Apple did, however, admit to scraping the public internet for data that then went into training its proprietary models, making it somewhat similar to other AI companies, some of whom have faced copyright lawsuits and sparked a debate over whether AI startups have unfairly profited off the work of humans. Apple hasn\u2019t said what web-based information it has ingested. It did say that publishers can add code to their sites to prevent Apple\u2019s web crawler from collecting their data. But that places the burden squarely on publishers to safeguard their own intellectual property, not the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/tech/apple-ai-data-openai-artificial-intelligence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

As of Monday morning, more than 10,000 people were evacuated in Meizhou, the hardest flood-hit city in Guangdong province. Seventeen waterways in the major Han River basin \u201crecorded flooding above alert level,\u201d including two rivers at record flood levels, according to the Ministry of Water Resources on Monday.

New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and a group of prominent business leaders were en route to Tokyo for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

{"id": "2024_06_17_style_wheatfield-ny-montana-agnes-denes", "text": "Four decades after the artist Agnes Denes planted and harvested a two-acre wheat field in Lower Manhattan, using one of the last undeveloped plots of land in the economic capital to create an idyllic but ephemeral vista, the ecological artist \u2014 now aged 93 \u2014 has reimagined the project in Montana. \u201cWheatfield \u2013 An Inspiration\u201d marks the first time the Budapest-born, New York-based artist has planted a wheat field in the US since she spent that muggy summer in 1982 with a group of volunteers cleaning up a landfill in Battery Park City to make it tenable for rows of the golden crop to grow. It drew crowds and reporters \u2014 including CNN \u2014 and made for a striking view as the wheat flourished against the backdrop of the Twin Towers. Made as an act of rebellion, the beauty of the field was a call to reprioritize human values and incite change among world powers decades before the environmental crisis became a mainstream concern. (It has been restaged internationally, including in Milan in 2015, and at Art Basel in Switzerland this month, concurrently with the field in Montana.) Out west, Denes hopes to plant seeds of community with the help of the project\u2019s host,\u00a0Tinworks, an arts organization in the rapidly developing city of Bozeman. Wheat may not be out of place in Montana, a top-producing state of the crop in the country\u2019s agricultural heartland, but it is a reminder of the changing landscape as urban centers continue to sprawl outwards and food insecurity looms due to climate change. \u201cWheat is wonderful \u2014 it sustains humanity and is probably the most planted food next to rice. It\u2019s a good metaphor,\u201d Denes said in a video call with CNN. \u201cThe original \u2018Wheatfield\u2019 was a confrontation of people who run the world. I wanted leaders to rethink the use of land and the use of humanity,\u201d she added. \u201cThis \u2018Wheatfield\u2019 is a totally different idea \u2014 to bring people together.\u201d Denes and Tinworks are doing so in collaboration with Bozeman residents, students and small businesses. Last fall, around 50 volunteers cleaned up the site, a lot owned by Tinworks, and planted the winter wheat led by a local fifth-generation farmer, Kenny Van Dyke. They will tend the wheat by hand all summer until September, when students from Montana State University\u2019s plant sciences department, which is also a partner on the project, will harvest the crop. Wheat will also be sprouting all around the city in solidarity with the project, thanks to some 200 packets of seeds Tinworks distributed to community members. Come fall, local bakeries will use the resulting flour milled from the grain in their products, and will help keep regional food banks stocked, according to Tinworks director Jenny Moore.  \u201c(\u2018Wheatfield\u2019) is so timely, in terms of the issues that we\u2019re facing with climate change, agricultural developments, food sustainability, food insecurity, the value of land and the loss of agricultural land in Bozeman,\u201d Moore said in a call. \u201cUnderstanding the presence and role of wheat in Montana both historically and presently, it just seemed like such a fantastic opportunity to ask Agnes if she would reconsider the work in (this) context.\u201d Though the wheat has successfully sprouted, unseasonably warm weather in December and January meant only scant snow for the winter crop, whose survival typically relies on several inches of coverage. At the time of the call with Moore in February, the field\u2019s future seemed precarious. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019d wished the weather wasn\u2019t so much proving the point of what a crisis point we\u2019re in,\u201d she said. Through land and time Over her career, Denes has been a pioneering figure in ecological art, with concepts that strive to \u201cunite the human intellect with the majesty of nature,\u201d as she described in her collection of writings, \u201cThe Human Argument.\u201d Her work is a call to action and, often, a warning, but always in service of demonstrating how art can help improve humanity. The scale of her projects is often grand and complex. Take \u201cTree Mountain,\u201d which involved planting 11,000 trees in a spiral formation in a gravel pit near Ylojarvi, Finland, in the 1990s. Embodying her fascination with mathematics in nature, structure and beauty, the form is based on the spiral of sunflower seeds, which follow the golden ratio. Each tree belongs to the person who planted it, an assertion of our shared responsibility over the stewardship of Earth \u201cThey own it. The only thing is, they can\u2019t sell it \u2014 no money is ever involved, but they can leave it to their children and their children\u2019s children in perpetuity,\u201d Denes explained. \u201cSo it becomes a family. The forest becomes a family connected by a tree.\u201d Many of her ideas are in this vein, with projects meant to establish conversations not only globally, but through vast stretches of time. \u201cI\u2019m the most impractical person you ever want to meet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it never comes into question of how difficult it\u2019s going to be\u2026 I know it\u2019s practical, because it\u2019s made for humanity.\u201d But though Denes has been extraordinarily prolific in her concepts and proposals \u2014 many of her some 200 ideas have been published in \u201cThe Human Argument\u201d \u2014 she has only realized a fraction of them in her lifetime. The majority only be experienced through writings, schematics and models. They include her plan to bury time capsules containing information about our current civilization in Antarctica\u2019s glaciers, to be carried out by the ocean in thousands of years\u2019 time, or an early idea to create a silent, flying aircraft to understand the movements and behaviors of migrating birds. \u201cPeople know me finally \u2014 (but) after working 60 years or 70 years, they know me on three or four projects. That\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you imagine if I could have realized 20 or 30?\u201d Sowing seeds for change As with \u201cWheatfield,\u201d seeds have often served as potent symbols for Denes. Her first noted work was a small, private performance in Sullivan County, New York, in 1968, which involved Denes planting rice seeds to signify life, chaining a series of trees together to represent decay, and burying a haiku to illustrate higher thinking \u2014 three concepts which exist in a triangularity, she asserted. Nine years later, she was invited to restage the performance at Artpark in Lewiston, where she planted a half-acre of rice on Niagara Gorge above the falls. More recently, she exhibited the verdant \u201cLiving Pyramid\u201d in Long Island, New York, in 2015; in Kassel, Germany, in 2017 for the international art show Documenta; and in Istanbul in 2022. Comprising rows of greenery that sloped upward into a vertiginous pyramid, the plants sprouted over the course of the exhibitions and were eventually given away to visitors.

Around 270 million people in the US will experience temperatures at or above 90 degrees this week as an impressive heat dome parks over the eastern US. Hundreds of records could be tied or broken this week. Multiple all-time June high temperature records could fall as the heat rises to levels normally seen only on the hottest July days. Parts of the Midwest to the Northeast could endure the longest heat wave they\u2019ve seen in decades, the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center said. Scientists have warned that heat waves will become increasingly severe as the climate crisis intensifies. Tens of millions of people who live as far north as Maine and aren\u2019t used to heat this intense will be sweating in temperatures well into the 90s this week. It will feel even hotter than that as humidity helps drive heat index values \u2013 how temperatures feel to the body \u2013 into the low 100s. Read more: Search continues for US tourist and two others missing amid Greek heat wave An extreme heat risk is in place from the Great Lakes into the Northeast this week, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday and Thursday will be the hottest days of the week, but the surrounding days will only be slightly less brutal. Heat will reach dangerous levels in many places including the major metropolitan areas of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York City and Boston. Temperatures soared 15 to 20 degrees above normal Monday afternoon and remained at elevated levels overnight. A few dozen temperature records fell as a result, including daily record highs in Chicago and Cleveland, and daily record warm low temperatures in places like Des Moines, Iowa. Temperatures will rise up to 25 degrees above normal through the rest of the workweek. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven\u2019t seen heat like this in about three decades. \u201cLast time we saw heat in Pittsburgh like what we\u2019re expecting next week was 30 yrs ago (almost to the day) when it reached 95\u00b0F or warmer for 6 straight days (June 15-20, 1994),\u201d the local weather service office said on X. \u201cThat stands as the longest stretch of 95+ (degree) days on record. We have a shot at tying or beating that.\u201d Some affected areas have started to activate heat protocols. Cooling centers will open across New York City starting Tuesday and cooling kits will be distributed to people working outdoors, Mayor Eric Adams said Monday. Burlington, Vermont, will also activate cooling centers starting Tuesday, according to the city. Recreation centers in Cleveland will be open for extended hours this week to serve as cooling centers, city officials said Monday. The city also suspended all playground programs for the week as temperatures soar. Heat domes like the one fueling this week\u2019s intense conditions trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The oven-like conditions mean overnight temperatures often don\u2019t cool down enough to offer relief for overheated bodies, posing increased risks for heat-related illness. \u201cWarm overnight temperatures only dropping into the mid-70s will offer little to no relief, especially to those without adequate or reliable cooling,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said.   Humidity will also join forces with extreme heat to create triple-digit heat indices \u2013 measurements of how hot the human body feels \u2013 in some areas. Chicago residents could feel\u00a0heat indices between 95 and 105 degrees through next week, the NWS in Chicago warned. Parts of eastern New York and western New England could see indices as high as 107 degrees. The NWS in Detroit, where the heat index could reach 100 degrees, urged residents to practice heat safety in the coming days, including limiting strenuous outdoor activities, staying hydrated, and checking up on neighbors who are elderly or don\u2019t have A/C. Heat-related illness is a concern in severely impacted areas, particularly for the elderly, young children and outdoor workers. Extreme heat is by far the deadliest form of severe weather, killing on average twice as many people a year as tornadoes and hurricanes combined.

{"id": "2024_06_17_asia_japan-record-spike-stss-bacterial-infection-intl-hnk", "text": "Cases of a dangerous and highly fatal bacterial infection have reached record levels in Japan, official figures show, with experts so far unable to pinpoint the reason for the rise. As of June 2, Japan\u2019s Health Ministry had recorded 977 cases of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which has a mortality rate of up to 30%. Some 77 people have died from the infection between January and March, the latest figures available. The ongoing outbreak in Japan has already surpassed last year\u2019s previous record of 941 preliminary infections \u2013 the highest since statistics began in 1999.\u00a0Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases reported 97 deaths due to STSS last year, the second-highest number of fatalities in the past six years. STSS is a rare but serious bacterial infection that can develop when bacteria spread into deep tissues and the bloodstream.\u00a0Patients initially suffer from fever, muscle pain and vomiting but symptoms can quickly turn life threatening with low blood pressure, swelling, and multiple organ failure as the body goes into shock. \u201cEven with treatment, STSS can be deadly. Out of 10 people with STSS, as many as three people will die from the infection,\u201d according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most STSS cases are caused by the group A streptococcus (GAS) bacteria, which mainly produces fever and throat infections in children. In rare circumstances, strep A can become invasive when bacterium produces a toxin that enables it to gain access to the bloodstream, causing serious illnesses such as toxic shock. Strep A can also cause\u00a0\u201cflesh-eating\u201d necrotizing fasciitis, which can lead to loss of limbs. However, most patients who contract that disease have other health factors that may lower their body\u2019s ability to fight infections, such as cancer or diabetes, according to the CDC. Invasive group A strep infections were largely curbed by Covid-19 controls, such as masking and social distancing, but after those measures were relaxed many countries reported a rise in cases. In December 2022, five European countries reported to the World Health Organization an increase in invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS), with children under 10 the most impacted. The CDC said it was also investigating an apparent increase in the disease at the time. In March, Japanese authorities warned of a jump in STSS cases. Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases released a risk assessment saying the number of STSS cases caused by iGAS \u201chas increased since July 2023, especially among those under 50 years of age.\u201d The CDC says older people with an open wound are at increased risk of contracting STSS, including those who have recently had surgery. \u201cHowever, experts don\u2019t know how the bacteria got into the body for nearly half of people who get STSS,\u201d the CDC said on its website. The reason for this year\u2019s rise in cases of STSS in Japan remains unclear, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Professor Ken Kikuchi, of Tokyo Women\u2019s Medical University, told NHK the rise could be due to people\u2019s weakened immune systems following Covid. \u201cWe can boost immunity if we are constantly exposed to bacteria. But that mechanism was absent during the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Kikuchi said. \u201cSo, more people are now susceptible to infection, and that may be one reason for the sharp rise in cases.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/asia/japan-record-spike-stss-bacterial-infection-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_asia_thailand-same-sex-marriage-intl-hnk", "text": "Thailand will become the first nation in Southeast Asia to legalize same-sex marriage after the kingdom\u2019s Senate approved a marriage equality bill on Tuesday, with supporters calling it a \u201cmonumental step forward for LGBTQ+ rights.\u201d The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of passing the bill following a final reading, with 130 senators voting in favor. Only four members opposed the bill. The bill still requires endorsement from the king before marriage equality can become reality in Thailand, but this process is considered a formality. The law will then come into effect 120 days after it is published in the royal gazette. The result of the vote means that Thailand will become only the third place in Asia to allow for marriage equality after\u00a0Taiwan legalized\u00a0same-sex marriage in 2019 and\u00a0Nepal in 2023. \u201cThe bill represents a monumental step forward for LGBTQ+ rights in Thailand,\u201d Panyaphon Phiphatkhunarnon, founder of Love Foundation \u2013 an NGO campaigning for\u00a0LGBTQ+ equality in\u00a0Thailand \u2013 told CNN. \u201cThe potential impact of this bill is immense. It would not only change the lives of countless couples but also contribute to a more just and equitable society for all.\u201d The bill grants LGBTQ+ couples the same legal rights and recognition as heterosexual couples, including rights related to inheritance, adoption and health care decision-making. \u201cBeyond the legal implications, the passage of this bill would send a powerful message of acceptance and inclusion,\u201d Panyaphon said. \u201cIt would inspire the younger generation to come out and live their lives authentically, it would showcase Thailand as a progressive and inclusive country \u2013 attracting tourists and businesses \u2026  and will foster a culture change where LGBTQ+ individuals feel accepted and supported.\u201d Bangkok residents Pokpong Jitjaiyai and Watit Benjamonkolchai say they plan to get married as soon as the law is passed. \u201cWhen I was young, people said people like us couldn\u2019t have a family, can\u2019t have children, so marriage was impossible,\u201d Pokpong told CNN. \u201cOver 10 years ago, we could not live together the way we are now. We could never be our true selves, the way it is now\u2026 and now I can freely say that I am gay.\u201d Pokpong said he hopes the marriage equality bill will start a \u201cdomino effect\u201d in other countries. \u201cI want the people around the world see how love is. Love is love,\u201d he said. The marriage equality bill was supported by all the major parties and marks a significant step in cementing the country\u2019s reputation as one of the friendliest in the region toward gay, lesbian and transgender people. Previous attempts\u00a0to legalize marriage equality over the past decade had stalled. In 2020, the Constitutional Court ruled that Thailand\u2019s current law, which stipulates marriage being between a man and a woman, was constitutional. Some of the major political parties contesting last year\u2019s election pledged to push marriage equality as part of their campaign, including the progressive Move Forward Party, which won the most seats. But that party, which had a huge youth following, was unable to form a government when former rivals joined forces to keep it out of office. Both the future of the party and of its popular former leader Pita Limjaroenrat remain uncertain as they face a slew of prosecutions. Nonetheless Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, of the Pheu Thai Party, had also promised to bring the marriage equality bill to parliament. Dressed in a rainbow shirt, Srettha attended Pride Month celebrations in Bangkok earlier in June, joining a massive parade through the capital\u2019s streets. \u201cIt is a basic right to choose who to love,\u201d he said in a post on X on June 1. Srettha has been keen to showcase Thailand as a welcoming destination for\u00a0LGBTQ+ people, including voicing support for a bid to host World Pride in 2030. \u201cWe have come far in our journey towards social equality. I want to reaffirm my government\u2019s commitment in pushing for the realization of the Equal Marriage Bill which today we can visibly see the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Srettha said on X on June 1. \u201cWe look forward to hosting of the World Pride in 2030 in Thailand.\u201d Regional outlier As only the third territory in Asia to embrace marriage equality, Thailand remains an outlier in a region that has been slow to grant LGBTQ+ rights and where members of the community often face discrimination, prejudice and even violence. Rising religious conservatism and colonial-era laws have make life hard for the LGBTQ+ community in much of Southeast Asia, where same-sex relations are criminalized in several countries, including Myanmar and Brunei. In Indonesia, homosexual sex is not illegal except in the extremely conservative province of Aceh. But LGBTQ+ people have faced widespread discrimination, police raids, vigilante attacks and open hostility by Indonesian authorities and Islamic groups across the country. Indonesia\u2019s new Criminal Code, ratified in 2022, makes consensual sex outside of marriage a criminal offense and rights groups say this will disproportionately impact LGBTQ+ people as same-sex couples cannot marry in Indonesia. In Malaysia, homosexuality is a crime punishable by fines and prison terms of up to 20 years. The Muslim majority country that has seen a rise in conservative attitudes in recent years. Rights groups say the LGBTQ+ community faces growing intolerance in Malaysia and accuse the government of being at least partly to blame. Singapore only repealed a colonial-era law that criminalized sex between men in 2022 but the Singapore government has reiterated its opposition to gay marriage and vowed to make it harder for people to legally challenge the government\u2019s policies. In Singapore, couples in registered marriages have access to greater housing subsidies and adoption rights than single people. Japan is the only Group of Seven (G7) country that has not recognized either\u00a0same-sex civil unions\u00a0or\u00a0same-sex marriage, despite recent high court decisions that ruled not allowing same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. Last year, India\u2019s top court declined to legally recognize same-sex unions in a landmark ruling, after campaigners had sought to obtain the right to marry under Indian law. In mainland China, Beijing has\u00a0widened crackdowns\u00a0on LGBTQ activists and groups in recent years, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping increasingly stressing the ruling Communist Party\u2019s absolute control over every aspect of society. In other jurisdictions, campaigners have made small gains on a case by case basis as they appeal through the courts. South Korea does not legally recognize same-sex marriage but in February 2023, a South Korean court ruled in favor of a same-sex couple seeking equal health benefits. South Korea has also drawn international criticism for\u00a0its military penal code,\u00a0which makes same-sex relations between men punishable by up to two years in prison. In past years, dozens have been arrested in what critics have called a \u201cgay witch-hunt.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/asia/thailand-same-sex-marriage-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_middleeast_israel-tactical-pause-gaza-aid-intl-hnk", "text": "The Israeli military has announced a \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed but stressed that there would be no let up in fighting in and around Rafah in southern Gaza. The pause began on Saturday and will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northwards, the IDF said. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has triggered a humanitarian crisis. A bottleneck of aid has built up at Kerem Shalom amid airstrikes and fighting in much of southern Gaza. The IDF has designated a route from Kerem Shalom to Al Bayuk and onto the European Hospital in Khan Younis to be open during the day for the transportation of humanitarian aid only. It will be run in coordination with international organizations, it said, as part of efforts to increase volumes of aid reaching Gaza. But soon after announcing the move, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said \u201cthe fighting in Rafah continues,\u201d adding \u201cthere is no change in the entry of goods into the Strip.\u201d The fierce fighting that been underway in Rafah as Israel seeks to destroy Hamas in Gaza continued on Sunday, with a civil defense official in Gaza telling CNN that heavy clashes are ongoing in neighborhoods of western Rafah. On Saturday, eight IDF soldiers were killed near the city, one of the single deadliest incidents of the war for Israeli troops.  The\u00a0director\u00a0of\u00a0UNRWA\u00a0affairs\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza, Scott Anderson, welcomed the \u201ctactical pause,\u201d telling CNN \u201cwe very much hope that this long pause every day will allow us to move freely back and forth.\u201d But a spokesperson for the UN Children\u2019s Fund warned the pause could not replace a ceasefire. \u201cI just don\u2019t know unfortunately [how long the pause will last], this is a question for the the occupying power, for Israel and its military,\u201d said James Elder. Meanwhile, criticisms of the \u201ctactical pause\u201d by senior Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have raised the question of who ordered it. According to an Israeli official, Netanyahu was unhappy when he first heard about it. Netanyahu then contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, said the official who spoke to CNN on Sunday and requested anonymity. Israel\u2019s security minister Ben Gvir \u2013 a leading right-wing member of the cabinet \u2013 has also condemned the pause. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. Humanitarian crisis The distribution of aid announced by Israel comes as Muslims in Gaza are marking Eid al-Adha with little food. Eid ul-Adha begins on Sunday evening and ends on Thursday, June 20. Human rights groups have described \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions for Palestinians in Gaza following eight months of Israeli bombardment, with over 75% of the population displaced,\u00a0according\u00a0to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. More than 37,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The conflict in the enclave began following the October 7 attacks led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that killed around 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages in southern Israel. More than 50,000 children in Gaza now require treatment for acute malnutrition, UNRWA said in a post on X on Saturday. \u201cWith continued restrictions to humanitarian access, people in #Gaza continue to face desperate levels of hunger. Over 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition.\u201d Last month, Israel pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah,\u00a0which led hundreds of thousands of already displaced people to leave the area. Internally displaced Palestinians are estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers\u00a0(27 square miles) \u2013 less than a fifth of the territory\u2019s area. Aid has been delivered to Gaza by land, sea and air since soon after the war began, but few entry points remain operational. Those are Kerem Shalom on Gaza\u2019s southern border and Western Erez in the north. Humanitarian agencies say that land routes are the quickest and most effective way of getting aid into Gaza at scale. But even when aid crosses into Gaza there are multiple issues with distributing it throughout Gaza, because convoys require Israeli approval, many roads are severely damaged and security is frequently challenging. Efforts to bring aid via sea have stuttered after the US military said Friday it would temporarily dismantle the\u00a0humanitarian pier it constructed off the coast of Gaza\u00a0due to heavy seas. It will be the second time in a matter of weeks that the\u00a0fragile\u00a0pier and causeway system, known as Joint Logistics over the Shore or JLOTS, has had to be moved back to the Israeli port of\u00a0Ashdod.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/middleeast/israel-tactical-pause-gaza-aid-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.\u201d \u201cMy treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months,\u201d Kate wrote. \u201cOn the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.\u201d She said she is hoping to join some more engagements over the summer, but acknowledged she is \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d King Charles III is \u201cdelighted\u201d to hear that Kate will be attending royal events on Saturday, according to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson Friday. \u201cHis Majesty is delighted that The Princess is able to attend tomorrow\u2019s events, and is much looking forward to all elements of the day,\u201d the spokesperson said. Kate will travel down the Mall in a carriage during Saturday\u2019s Trooping the Colour, accompanied by her children. She will watch the rest of the parade with her family nearby, and is expected to join fellow royals on the balcony. It represents a significant moment in the Princess\u2019s recovery, marking her first public appearance since Christmas Day \u2013 weeks before her cancer diagnosis. But it does not represent a return to public duties, and throughout her recovery, any appearances will be taken alongside medical guidance and will be subject to change if required. \u201cI have been blown away by all the kind messages of support and encouragement over the last couple of months,\u201d Kate wrote. \u201cIt really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times.\u201d \u201cI am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal.\u201d Kate first stepped away from public duties in January, following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. In March, amid speculation about her wellbeing, she revealed in a video message that she had been diagnosed with cancer after the operation. \u201cMy medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy,\u201d she said in that update, adding she was in the early stages of that treatment. The Princess\u2019s cancer diagnosis stunned the country, especially as it came so soon after Charles announced that he had also been diagnosed with cancer. Neither royal has specified the type of cancer they are receiving treatment for, or revealed details about their progress. Charles said in March he was \u201cso proud\u201d of Catherine, his daughter-in-law, for \u201cher courage in speaking as she did\u201d in sharing her diagnosis.

But Gantz \u2013 seen as Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable political opponent \u2013 announced his \u201ccomplex and painful\u201d decision to withdraw from the cabinet last week, citing Netanyahu\u2019s failure to devise a strategy for the conflict in Gaza and the future governance of the Strip. \u201cNetanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory [in Gaza],\u201d Gantz said June 9. He accused Netanyahu of putting his own personal political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, claiming that \u201cfateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political considerations,\u201d and urged the prime minister to hold an election in the coming months. \u201cI call on Netanyahu: set an agreed election date. Do not let our people be torn apart,\u201d Gantz said. In April, Gantz called\u00a0for early elections\u00a0to be held as soon as September, ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, saying \u201cIsraeli society needs to renew its contract with its leadership.\u201d The month before, he had traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with US Vice President Kamala Harris in a trip not sanctioned by the Israeli government. Gantz often surpasses the prime minister in popularity, according to opinion polls.\u00a0A survey published Friday\u00a0by the Israeli Maariv newspaper showed support for Gantz at 42%, compared to 34% for Netanyahu. Gantz\u2019s resignation sparked calls from far-right members in Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, to join the war cabinet. Both men were earlier pointedly excluded from the cabinet at Gantz\u2019s behest. By dismantling the cabinet, Netanyahu may have avoided having to accede to Ben-Gvir\u2019s calls to join the cabinet, which could have further strained Israel\u2019s relations with the United States, or having to reject his demands, which could have angered the more extreme wing of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. Another interpretation is that without Gantz \u2013 and Eisenkot who also resigned \u2013 in it, there was no longer any point in keeping the war cabinet going. Instead, an Israeli official tells CNN, Netanyahu will in future hold smaller forums to discuss sensitive matters relating to the war with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear whether Ben-Gvir will be excluded from these as well. As National Security Minister, Ben-Gvir attends Israel\u2019s security cabinet alongside 12 other ministers, including Smotrich, Gallant and Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have urged that Israel sustain its assault on Gaza until Hamas is defeated completely, and threatened to topple Netanyahu\u2019s government if he accepts a peace proposal that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden last month. After the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday announced a daily \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed, Ben-Gvir condemned the decision. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday the dissolution of the war cabinet did not change the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cfundamental assessment\u201d of the war in Gaza, saying \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to have very direct and candid conversations\u201d with \u201cwhatever government is in place.\u201d He added that the US \u201cvery much\u201d welcomed the announcement of the \u201ctactical pause\u201d \u2013 but said the US would judge Israel \u201cby the results.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of humanitarian pauses, it\u2019s to the question of how much aid gets delivered. The pause ultimately is only a means to an end,\u201d he said. Aid groups are saying that no difference has yet been seen on the ground.

{"id": "2024_06_17_asia_pig-butchering-scam-southeast-asia-dst-intl-hnk", "text": "Sitting at the kitchen table, Matt struggles to recount the events of the past few months. \u201cAs soon as I found out that it was a suicide, I was 100% sure that it was the scam,\u201d he says. \u201cOur father was, from the day I was born until six months ago, always a positive, happy person. This was literally the only thing in his life that had happened, to where it changed him, and it just crushed him.\u201d On a horse farm in northern Virginia, surrounded by sprawling fields and stables, the family gathers at their younger sister Adrianne\u2019s house - something they\u2019ve done a lot in the three months since their father took his own life after falling victim to a so-called \u201cpig butchering\u201d scam. The scams \u2013 mostly run out of Southeast Asia - are given that name because they involve \u201cfattening up\u201d victims before taking everything they have. The con artists behind them take on false online identities and spend months financially grooming their victims to get them to invest on fraudulent cryptocurrency websites. Dennis Jones, an avid runner and photographer, was adored by his children and grandchildren. Described as \u201ca bit of an activist\u201d by his family, the 82-year-old spent much of his retirement working with refugees and debating politics online. But in the last few months of his life he withdrew from his family and, having been divorced for years, befriended a woman going by the name Jessie on Facebook. The two had been talking online for months and built a close relationship. Eventually, Jessie convinced Dennis to invest in crypto. Dennis complied. Without ever meeting Jessie in person, he spent everything he had, and when he had nothing left, she demanded more. Until one day the money disappeared, leaving him in ruin. In early March, Dennis\u2019 children scheduled a meeting to help their father get back on his feet after the scam. The plan was for him to move in with Adrianne and her family. \u201cWe wanted him to know that he was going to be taken care of,\u201d Matt said. But the morning of the meeting none of them could reach Dennis. Matt drove to Dennis\u2019s apartment but he wasn\u2019t home, and all calls went straight to voicemail. They figured he must be out on one of his long runs. An hour later, police knocked on Matt\u2019s door to inform him that Dennis had taken his own life. Dennis was one of countless victims of a massive global criminal operation predominantly run by Chinese gangs who have built a multibillion-dollar scam industry in Southeast Asia. There, they\u2019ve assembled an army of scammers, many held against their will in guarded compounds and forced to con people all around the world out of their life savings. It\u2019s theft at a scale so large that investigators are now calling it a mass transfer of wealth from middle-class Americans to criminal gangs. Last year, the FBI estimates, pig butchering scams stole nearly $4 billion from tens of thousands of American victims, a 53% increase from the year before. While the crime takes place online, its real-world consequences are devastating. Law enforcement sources predict that losses will continue to grow in the next year, and as the criminals remain out of reach, money and lives will continue to be lost. \u2018Victims victimizing victims\u2019 Santa Clara county prosecutor Erin West has dedicated the last few years to fighting pig butchering scams. \u201cI\u2019ve been a prosecutor for over 25 years, I\u2019ve done all kinds of different types of crime. I spent nine years in sexual assault. And I\u2019ve never seen the absolute decimation of people that I\u2019ve seen as a result of pig butchering,\u201d she says. Being in the heart of the tech industry in California\u2019s Bay Area, Erin and her team were some of the first to begin investigating pig butchering scams. \u201cWe\u2019ve got victims victimizing victims and the only winners are Chinese gangsters,\u201d she says. Shawn Bradstreet, US special agent in charge of the San Francisco field office, told CNN that some of the money stolen from American victims is spent on expanding the scam operations and the massive compounds that house them and other illicit activities. West and Bradstreet are part of a small group of US law enforcement agencies working to find ways to tackle a crime that largely takes place online and overseas. Social media is flooded with scammers hunting for victims, on WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn and, increasingly, dating apps such as Bumble and Tinder. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that scammers may pull on the heartstrings on those looking for love or connection - on dating apps and on all online platforms,\u201d a spokesman for Match group, which owns Tinder, said in a statement. Match, Bumble, Facebook and Whatsapp parent company Meta told CNN they are working to prevent scammers from using their platforms, by flagging suspicious language and educating their users. In a statement to CNN a Bumble spokesperson said they have introduced AI to help identify spam, scam and fake profiles \u201caiming to take action before such profiles have the opportunity to interact with members.\u201d CNN has reached out to LinkedIn for comment. In May, a group of tech companies including cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase, Meta, Match group and the anti-scam charity organization GASO announced the \u201cTech Against Scams Coalition,\u201d acknowledging that scams \u201care a pervasive issue across the entire tech landscape.\u201d But West says that\u2019s not enough. She recently set up a task force called Operation Shamrock to bring together law enforcement, social media, crypto exchanges and traditional banks to tackle crypto scams. A 2023 CNN investigation revealed that many of the scammers are themselves victims of human trafficking. Lured to Southeast Asia with promises of white-collar jobs, they are instead trafficked into Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and other destinations. Since a 2021 military coup, Myanmar has become Asia\u2019s scam capital where criminals can operate freely under the cover of a bloody civil war. Today, city-sized compounds loom over the Myanmar side of the border with Thailand, with nothing but a dried-out river separating the two countries. Inside are what can only be described as scam factories \u2014 offices full of hundreds of slaves, working 16-hour days to befriend victims and convince them to invest in cryptocurrency on fake platforms that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges. Those kept inside tell stories of torture and abuse, of scammers who don\u2019t bring in enough money being beaten with electrical sticks and forced to do hundreds of squats as punishment. Rakesh, an Indian national, was trafficked to a compound called Gate 25 in Myanmar after applying for an IT job in Thailand in late 2022. There he signed a scamming contract under threat of execution, and was trained to scam. For 11 months he posed as \u201cKlara Semonov,\u201d a Russian investor based in Salt Lake City. To avoid gruesome punishments inflicted by his captors, he said he sent romantic messages to victims like Dennis to convince them to invest their money. \u201cSeventy to 80% fall for fake love,\u201d he said. Rakesh was eventually released in 2023 when his contract ended. He believes he was let go because he simply wasn\u2019t good enough at scamming. \u201cThey (were) treating us like slaves,\u201d he told CNN days after his release in 2023. Conveniently located on the border, the compounds use telecoms services from the Thai side. In November 2023 Thai Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong said they were working to cut off the compounds. Pachara Naripthaphan of the Thai National Broadcasting Transmissions Commission has since told CNN that in May they instructed all telecom operators to shut off wireless services in proximity to any areas bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia. Despite that, their data shows that illicit activity has continued at a baseline level as criminals adjust to using other means of connecting to the internet such as Starlink. Even here on the border, where the physical distance is reduced to nothing but a narrow river, the criminals remain out of the reach of law enforcement, either locally or internationally. \u201cMany of these perpetrators are beyond my reach. And in order to establish deterrence, we need to prosecute some individuals who are running these operations in Southeast Asia,\u201d Santa Clara district attorney Jeff Rosen says. According to FBI data, out of nearly $5 billion dollars lost to cryptocurrency fraud in 2023, $3.96 billion was stolen in pig butchering scams. While Rosen\u2019s office and the Secret Service have had some success in retrieving millions of dollars in stolen funds, no American law enforcement agency has been able to arrest a single suspected scammer. \u2018Hard to believe\u2019 Carina, who asked CNN to only use her first name, met \u201cEvan\u201d on Bumble in May 2023. His photos showed a blond man with piercing blue eyes. He claimed to be Dutch and showed off his wealth \u2014 expensive cars and Rolexes, though none of that appealed to Carina, a chemistry PhD and triathlete. Their relationship moved fast. Right away he suggested they move their conversation to WhatsApp and delete the Bumble app to focus on getting to know each other. A few days later he started calling her \u201choney.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re doing that already?\u201d Carina asked, in a text conversation seen by CNN. Evan claimed he had made his money running a company with his uncle and investing in crypto. He told her she could pay off her student loans in a matter of months by investing. Carina was hesitant at first but eventually agreed to put in $1,000. He told her not to use the official app of the Kraken crypto platform, and instead sent her a link to a parallel website which they used to trade in the coming months. As their investments grew, so did their relationship. The two made plans for the future, romantic weekend getaways and family introductions, though they were yet to meet in person. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you before. Hard to believe I\u2019m falling for a man I have never seen or spoken to,\u201d Carina told him just a few weeks in. The first red flag emerged when Evan pressured Carina to enter an \u201cevent\u201d where she would have to invest $150,000 by the end of July to make extra profit. If she failed to reach the target, her account and money would be frozen. Scared to lose the money she had already put in, Carina panicked. She took out a high-interest loan and borrowed money from friends and family to meet the deadline. Despite all his purported wealth, Evan refused to help her, instead lying and telling her he was struggling to meet his target of $500,000 and needed her help, she said. At one point, Carina found herself consoling her scammer, telling him the money didn\u2019t matter as long as they loved each other. \u2018Major psychological stunt\u2019 After Dennis took his life, his adult children were left piecing together what happened by going through his Facebook messages. There, they learned for the first time what Dennis had been dealing with. \u201cI have been having dark thoughts about my life and it being over. Certainly it looks like my financial life is done,\u201d Dennis messaged his scammer in the months before his death. \u201cAnd the ultimate pain here is that I have betrayed family trust. This is unbearable,\u201d he writes in screenshots of their conversation seen by CNN. \u201cWhat\u2019s most heartbreaking is reading through these messages. He was talking about having signs of a nervous breakdown. And so these were all shared with the profile,\u201d Adrianne says. \u201cInstead of sharing with us,\u201d Matt adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing here is that these scammers overseas have figured out a way that they can get victims to trust them over their own families,\u201d West says. \u201cIt\u2019s a major psychological stunt that they\u2019re pulling on the rest of the world.\u201d Carina didn\u2019t tell her family about what had happened and the stress she was under until the very final moment. After hitting their event targets, Carina tried to withdraw some of her money, but was unable to do so, having violated platform rules by investing in the same account as Evan. After months of hiding it, Carina told her family, who suggested she speak to Kraken directly. The next morning she called Kraken customer services, who informed her there was no account under her name.  \u201cI realized I had been scammed at that point. And I broke down,\u201d Carina says. \u201cIt was all fake. It was a fake profile. It was a fake story. The amount of time that he spent grooming and getting to know me was incessant.\u201d Reading through their conversations a year later, Carina barely recognizes herself. \u201cIt\u2019s actually heartbreaking for me to see the state that I was in,\u201d she says. The emotional and financial entanglement had taken a toll on her, and she was left reeling from a breakup and bankruptcy at the same time. In the aftermath, Carina had to move back in with her mother. It will take her at least a decade to repay her debts. \u2018Playing on emotions\u2019 Their grief still raw, Adrianne and Matt are only now starting to understand what happened to their father. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t up against one person. It\u2019s a multibillion-dollar criminal organization with a playbook that\u2019s playing on the emotions \u2026 It was almost like he was brainwashed to some extent,\u201d Dennis\u2019 daughter Adrianne says. As the criminals\u2019 tactics continue to evolve and law enforcement struggles to find a way to stop them, there will be more victims in 2024, and more people like Matt and Adrianne, who suffer a loss far greater than money. \u201cHe died embarrassed, ashamed, financially devastated, heartbroken. And if sharing our story helps somebody else or another family, then it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Adrianne says.

{"id": "2024_06_18_middleeast_hezbollah-drone-video-israel-haifa-intl-latam", "text": "Israel warned Hezbollah on Tuesday of the prospect of \u201call-out war\u201d after the Lebanese militant group published a 9-minute video, purportedly taken by a drone, showing Israeli military and civilian locations in several Israeli cities. \u201cWe are getting very close to the moment of deciding to change the rules of the game against Hezbollah and Lebanon,\u201d Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on X. \u201cIn an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed, and Lebanon severely beaten,\u201d he added. Parts of the Hezbollah footage, filmed in the daytime, claimed to show Krayot, a cluster of \u201chighly populated\u201d residential cities north of the Israeli city of Haifa and 28 km (17 miles) south of the Lebanese border, along with malls and high rises. Other parts claimed to show a military complex near Haifa belonging to Israeli weapons manufacturer Rafael \u2013 including Iron Dome batteries, missile storage sites and radar sites \u2013 and military boats, ships and oil storage depots in the port of Haifa. The publication of the video follows months of intensifying cross-border attacks between Hezbollah and Israel in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks, and the ensuing military campaign by the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza. In his response, Katz also underlined the global repercussions of any potential attack on Haifa. \u201c(Hezbollah\u2019s secretary-general Hassan) Nasrallah is bragging today that he photographed the ports of Haifa, which are operated by huge international companies from China and India, and threatening to damage them,\u201d he said. The US and its allies have for months warned Hezbollah, an\u00a0Iran-backed\u00a0Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, against escalating the\u00a0conflict in Israel. Tensions have nevertheless been rising in recent weeks. CNN analysis has geolocated the video to a number of locations around Haifa. Those locations include a number of sensitive areas, including at least two military installations: a base in northern Haifa and the port of Haifa. The drone also flew over the oil tanks that sit north of Haifa, the Haifa airport and several residential areas. CNN also analyzed the shadows in the videos, which indicate the drone mission over Haifa lasted multiple hours, or took place over multiple days. The analysis shows parts of the video have been sped up. Weapons expert Wim Zwijnenburg, project leader for humanitarian disarmament at the Dutch peace organization PAX, told CNN that a drone visible in the footage appears to be \u201can Iranian-origin model of a Qasaf-2k, possibly manufactured locally.\u201d \u2018Psychological terror\u2019 The mayor of Haifa, Yona Yahav, has described the video as \u201cpsychological terror\u201d and demanded a protection plan for his city, criticizing IDF commanders for not having visited Haifa since the October 7 Hamas attack. \u201cI demand that the government present a plan for the massive defense of Haifa and find a military solution to eliminate the threat posed from the north,\u201d Yahav told Israeli radio station\u00a0Reshet Bet. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the video. Hezbollah has claimed the video was the \u201cfirst episode,\u201d suggesting more videos would surface from deep inside Israeli territory. A Hezbollah lawmaker in the Lebanese parliament who referenced the video in a social media post has also suggested more is to come. \u201cThis is what the party [Hezbollah] announced and you saw, but what is hidden is greater and greater and greater! Haifa and beyond, beyond, and beyond Haifa,\u201d Ibrahim Mousawi said in the post. His message appears to be a reference to a phrase coined by Nasrallah during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when he said the militant group would fire rockets at Haifa \u201cand beyond Haifa\u201d. Israeli military increasing readiness Israel has been preparing for the possibility that diplomatic efforts to reduce hostilities with Hezbollah could fail. The release of the footage comes as Israel\u2019s military says it has \u201capproved and validated\u201d operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon and made decisions on increasing the readiness of troops in the field. The plans were approved by the commanding officer of the Northern Command and the head of the Operations Directorate during a joint situational assessment to prepare for the continuation of combat, the IDF said in a statement. The approval of the operational plans does not mean a war between Israel and Hezbollah is imminent \u2013 but it does signal that Israel intends to be ready for such a scenario. Hezbollah has fired more than 5,000 rockets, missiles and drones at northern Israel since October 7, claiming that its attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Hezbollah has said in the past that it will only stop firing on Israel if Israel stops the war in Gaza. For its part, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Lebanon and evacuated approximately 60,000 residents from the northern border. More than 90,000 Lebanese have also fled their homes in the area. The US has sought a diplomatic off-ramp to avoid a wider war that could spread to the region, sending special envoy Amos Hochstein to Israel and Lebanon this week to try to ease tensions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/middleeast/hezbollah-drone-video-israel-haifa-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_brazil-pantanal-wetland-fires-intl-latam", "text": "Brazil\u2019s Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland on earth, is ablaze, with fires in June breaking historical records for that month. While aerial views of the wetland show smoke rising and the bright orange of burning fires, a closer look at burnt vegetation found charred skeletons of wildlife, including an alligator, monkey and snake, photos from Reuters showed earlier this week. Brazil\u2019s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has detected 733 fires in the Pantanal biome so far this month, with the previous record for fires in Pantanal for June being 435 registered in 2005. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which encompasses 60% of the Brazilian Pantanal, is under a \u201cdanger\u201d warning for a heat wave expected to hit with temperatures 5\u00baC higher than average for the next three to five days, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET). The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) Brazil has warned that the entire year of 2024 could become the worst year on record for the Pantanal as the dry season is just beginning, and the number of fires this year already represents an increase of 898% compared to the same period in 2023, according to INPE\u2019s data. \u201cIt is necessary to act quickly reinforcing [fire] brigades and counting with the support of the local communities to avoid a catastrophe\u201d, said Cynthia Santos, conservation analyst for WWF Brazil, in a statement. What to know about the wetlands The Pantanal\u2019s distinctive habitats rely on what scientists call the \u201cflood pulse.\u201d During the wet season between November and March, three quarters of the plain gets flooded, only for much of the water to drain away during the dry months, from April to September. This seasonal flooding makes the Pantanal a unique biome where large swaths of land regularly turn from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and back again. Wetlands like the Pantanal are Earth\u2019s most effective carbon sinks \u2013 ecosystems that absorb and store more carbon than they release, keeping it away from the atmosphere. At roughly 200,000 square kilometers, the Pantanal comprises about 3% of the globe\u2019s wetlands and plays a key role in the carbon cycle. When these carbon-rich ecosystems burn, vast amounts of heat-trapping gases are released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (known as the World Wildlife Fund in the US and Canada), the Pantanal boasts the greatest concentration of wildlife in South America \u2013 higher than that of its more famous northern neighbor, the Amazon. \u201cThe Pantanal is very important for the planet, it has unique wild areas that are fundamental to life on Earth,\u201d said Andre Luiz Siqueira, the CEO of ECOA, an environmental NGO based in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, speaking to CNN in 2020. The area is home to thousands of endangered or unusual species, including jaguars, capybaras, black caimans, giant otters and hyacinth macaws. It\u2019s also an important stop on the routes of around 180 species of migratory birds. The wetland is facing a \u201chydrological crisis scenario\u201d due to an intense drought. The lack of rain began in 2023 and has been aggravated by the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, according to ECOA. Occasional wildfires are normal in the Pantanal, so much so that some plants in the region developed resistance to fires \u2013 for example by growing thick bark or covering their seeds with hard shells. In 2020, the fires destroyed unique habitats and wrecked the livelihoods of many of the Pantanal\u2019s diverse indigenous communities.

{"id": "2024_06_17_weather_hurricane-season-gulf-coast-flooding", "text": "A tropical storm warning is now in effect for parts of South Texas and northeastern Mexico as the first tropical threat of the year closes in on the areas. It\u2019s not the only area of tropical concern looming large this week as a predicted hyperactive hurricane season kicks into gear. The system threatening the southwestern Gulf Coast has been designated Potential Tropical Cyclone One by the National Hurricane Center as it tries to get organized in the Gulf of Mexico. It will unload torrential rainfall and considerably ramp up the flood threat, not just in the US, but also in parts of Mexico and Central America. As the name suggests, Potential Tropical Cyclone One isn\u2019t quite a tropical storm yet, but is expected to become one and poses a threat to the areas in the tropical storm warning over the next 48 hours. The system had 40 mph winds Tuesday morning \u2013 strong enough that if it does develop a coherent circulation, it would be named Tropical Storm Alberto. It\u2019s forecast to by late Tuesday or Wednesday before approaching the northern coast of Mexico on Wednesday night. The system\u2019s strength will be limited by its short time over water, but it\u2019s main threat of significant rain and flooding will not: multiple days of gushing rainfall for parts of Central America, southern Mexico\u00a0and the US western Gulf Coast. Heavy rain was already ongoing Monday in parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras as the gyre churned. Double-digit rainfall totals are possible in these areas by Thursday. Rain is needed desperately in parts of Mexico and Central America that are bone-dry after weeks of unrelenting heat. But day after day of heavy rain will quickly overwhelm parched soils unable to absorb water as fast as it falls, resulting in dangerous flooding. Deep tropical moisture was also fueling storms as far north as the US\u2019s western Gulf Coast. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in portions of coastal and southern Texas by the weekend, while other portions of the Gulf Coast could pick up several inches through midweek. A level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for the Texas coast Tuesday and much of South Texas on Wednesday. By Wednesday, the air over the Gulf Coast will be loaded up with \u201cincredible amounts of moisture\u201d which could \u201ceasily\u201d produce flash flooding, the Weather Prediction Center warned Monday. Heavy rain isn\u2019t the most welcome sight along some parts of the US Gulf Coast. June has been drier after a drenching spring, but the soil and area rivers are still holding on to plenty of water in eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Another tropical threat could take shape Another tropical threat is stirring in the Atlantic as development gets underway in the Gulf of Mexico. An area of showers and thunderstorms a few hundred miles east of the Bahamas could be the starting point for a potential tropical system later this week. Right now, the National Hurricane Center gives it a low chance of developing into a tropical system. Multiple atmospheric factors must align for the area of stormy weather to get its act together, but the opportunity for development exists over the next few days as it slowly pushes westward. If something tropical does develop, it could approach the southeastern US by Thursday or Friday and be steered south of the heat dome roasting areas farther north. It\u2019s unclear exactly which areas could be impacted, but anywhere from Florida to the Carolinas should keep a close eye on the forecast as it comes into focus in the coming days. Drenching rain could soak parts of the Southeast coast and rough seas are possible from the Bahamas to the mid-Atlantic coasts regardless of development.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/weather/hurricane-season-gulf-coast-flooding/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Thursday\u2019s order by the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas sets the date for a high-profile showdown over Media Matters\u2019 research highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on the social media platform. In November, X\u00a0sued Media Matters, alleging that the group went out of its way to misrepresent the likelihood that users may encounter hate speech on the platform.

Media Matters President Angelo Carusone\u00a0has previously called X\u2019s suit \u201cfrivolous\u201d and an attempt to silence Musk\u2019s critics. The lawsuit claimed that Media Matters\u2019 testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the group\u2019s reports distorted the odds of a person seeing extremist material. Motions for summary judgment in the case are due in December, and a decision by the judge on those filings could decide the case prior to trial. Musk has suffered setbacks in similar cases. In March, a federal judge in California reprimanded X and tossed out a lawsuit it had filed against another watchdog group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_europe_putin-conditions-peace-talks-ukraine-intl", "text": "President Vladimir Putin said Russia will only end its war in Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders the entirety of four regions claimed by Moscow and abandons its bid to join NATO \u2013 terms Kyiv immediately dismissed as a \u201ccomplete sham\u201d and \u201coffensive to common sense.\u201d Speaking Friday ahead of a peace conference in Switzerland to which Russia has not been invited, Putin set out his conditions for a \u201cfinal end\u201d to the war in more granular detail than at any previous time since he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. As well as withdrawing from the four occupied regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, Putin said Ukraine must demilitarize and that Western countries must lift their sanctions on Russia, which have damaged but not crippled its economy. While these conditions are more maximalist than those Putin has hinted at before, they represent Russia\u2019s failure to achieve its original war aims, when Moscow believed it could capture Kyiv in days and the rest of Ukraine in weeks. Nearly 28 months later, Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula it annexed a decade ago. Ukrainian and certain Western officials have repeatedly warned that Putin intends to settle for nothing less than Kyiv\u2019s total defeat, and that any truce or peace talks are merely a guise to allow Russia\u2019s troops to regroup and launch a fresh and fiercer offensive in the future. But, in comments to the foreign ministry, Putin said Russia\u2019s conditions for peace talks are \u201csimple,\u201d beginning with the total withdrawal of Ukraine\u2019s troops from the entire territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Moscow only controls these regions partially, but claimed the whole of each region was part of Russia\u2019s territory in 2022. Putin stressed that Ukraine should surrender not just the territory on the Russian side of the frontline, which splices through each of these regions, but \u201cthe entire territory of these regions.\u201d \u201cAs soon as they declare in Kyiv that they are ready for such a decision and begin the real withdrawal of troops from these regions \u2013 and also officially notify about the abandonment of plans to join NATO \u2013 our side will immediately, at the same minute, make the order to cease fire and begin negotiations,\u201d he said. Putin promised to \u201cguarantee the unhindered and safe withdrawal of Ukrainian units and formations,\u201d and said Moscow acknowledges its role in global stability. He asked that his terms for ending the war would need to be cemented in international agreements. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country \u201cdoes not trust\u201d Putin\u2019s \u201cultimatum,\u201d which he said did not significantly differ from previous offers he has made before. Speaking Friday from the Group of Seven summit in Italy, Zelensky drew parallels between Putin\u2019s tactics and those used by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to conquer swaths of Europe in the 1930s and 40s. \u201cHe talks about regions of our country, and he says he will not stop,\u201d Zelensky told CNN affiliate Sky Tg24. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing Hitler did, when he said \u2018give me a part of Czechoslovakia and that\u2019s the end of it.\u2019 You can\u2019t trust it,\u201d Zelensky said, referring to Hitler\u2019s annexation of the Sudetenland and Western countries\u2019 failed policy of appeasement. \u201cThat is why we must not trust these messages, because Putin follows the same course,\u201d Zelensky warned. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called on Kyiv\u2019s allies to \u201cget rid of illusions\u201d and to stop taking Russia\u2019s proposals seriously, describing Putin\u2019s terms as \u201coffensive to common sense.\u201d \u201cThere is no novelty in this, no real peace proposals and no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue it in new formats. It\u2019s all a complete sham,\u201d Podolyak said. Putin\u2019s speech comes on the eve of the Swiss peace conference, in which nearly 100 countries and organizations will take part. He dismissed the conference as \u201canother ploy to divert everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/europe/putin-conditions-peace-talks-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Jailed for most of the past two decades, Mohammadi was sentenced to a further stretch in prison by authorities who found her guilty of carrying out \u201cpropaganda activities against the regime,\u201d Mostafa Nili, her lawyer, announced on social media. According to Nili, the Iranian regime cited statements Mohammadi made concerning Iranian student and journalist Dina Ghalibaf, who was arrested in April after she publicly claimed to have been sexually assaulted by members of Iran\u2019s morality police. The authorities also cited a letter Mohammadi wrote calling on Iranians to boycott parliamentary elections back in February and the activist\u2019s correspondence with Swedish and Norwegian parliaments. In the past three years, Mohammadi has undergone six trials in revolutionary and criminal courts, resulting\u00a0in a total sentence of 13 years and three months in prison, 154 lashes, exile, and four months of street cleaning, Nili said. Her sentence was most recently extended in January, when she was handed an additional 15 months in prison after being charged with \u201cspreading propaganda\u201d against the Islamic Republic regime, her family said. But incarceration has not impeded Mohammadi\u2019s activism: The 52-year-old recently published a letter calling for an end to the war in Gaza. In the letter, Mohammadi condemned an Israeli strike on a refugee camp in Rafah that killed over 45 Palestinians. From her cell, Mohammadi has also remained committed to amplifying the cause of Iranian women who have staged numerous protests in a bid to resist the regime\u2019s mandatory hijab rule. Iran was rocked by nationwide protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old woman who died in the custody of Iran\u2019s morality police after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.

{"id": "2024_06_18_china_north-korea-russia-putin-kim-visit-ukraine-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "As Russian President Vladimir Putin makes his first visit to North Korea in more than two decades, his focus is widely seen to be on securing ongoing support from the hermit nation for his grinding war in Ukraine. Putin ramped up his outreach to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year as his weapons stockpiles dwindled \u2013 and munitions and missiles have flowed from the country to Russia since a landmark summit between the two leaders in September, multiple governments say, even as both Pyongyang and Moscow deny the transfers. But while the leaders\u2019 meeting in the globally isolated, Soviet-style capital of Pyongyang provides an opportunity for the two autocrats to discuss how to expand that cooperation, observers say it will have consequences far beyond the battlefield in Ukraine. Putin\u2019s arrival in Pyongyang in the early hours of Wednesday local time for the two-day visit marks a significant step forward for a partnership founded on shared hostility to the West and its allies \u2013 one that empowers both leaders and deepens global fault lines. The two are expected to ink a new strategic partnership agreement, with Putin saying ahead of the visit that they would \u201cshape the architecture of equal and indivisible security in Eurasia,\u201d according to the Kremlin. \u201cThe relationship is not just about necessity,\u201d said Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who focuses on the Korean Peninsula. \u201cWe are seeing the two states forge an increasingly concerted united front and alignment against the United States and the West.\u201d These divisions were only underscored by the timing of the visit, which comes on the heels of Putin\u2019s meeting with close ally Chinese leader Xi Jinping last month and after democratic leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) used a summit in Italy to again show their solidarity against Moscow\u2019s war. It also comes as North Korea has railed against growing security cooperation between the US and its allies South Korea and Japan, raising concerns with its escalated rhetoric and ongoing tests to bolster an extensive illegal weapons program. It remains publicly unknown just what Pyongyang is receiving in return for its support for Russia\u2019s war. But governments from Seoul to Washington will be watching closely for signs of how far the warring Russian leader, who in the past supported international controls on North Korea\u2019s illegal weapons program, is willing to go to back Kim\u2019s bellicose regime. What do Russia and North Korea want from each other? In the months after Kim rode his armored train through the country\u2019s Far East region for a landmark September summit with Putin, North Korean munitions appeared to pour into Russia \u2013 and be fired in its assault on Ukraine. Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers \u2013 the equivalent of 260,000 metric tons of munitions or munitions-related material \u2013 from North Korea since September, according to a US statement in February. Russian forces have also launched at least 10 North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine since September, a US official also said in March. The weapons may be of lesser quality than Russia\u2019s own, but have helped Russia replenish its dwindling stockpiles and keep pace with the weapons support Ukraine is receiving from the West, observers say. The arrangement may also enable North Korea to gain real-world intel on the functioning of its weaponry and help it ramp up exports more broadly. In an article published in North Korea state media ahead of the visit, Putin thanked Pyongyang for showing \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and said the two countries were \u201cready to confront the ambition of the collective West.\u201d Putin is widely seen as set to use his visit, which Kim invited him to make last September, to secure ongoing support. Less is known about exactly what compensation Pyongyang has received so far in return. South Korean officials have said the North is receiving shipments of food and other necessities from Russia, and there is no shortage of needs for the sanctions-strapped economy, which in addition to food lacks fuel and raw materials \u2013 but also seeks to advance its space, missile and nuclear programs. Putin signaled a willingness to assist North Korea in developing its space and satellite program during their September meeting, which took place, fittingly, at a rocket launch facility. There have since been signs that such assistance has taken place, including the successful launch of North Korea\u2019s first military reconnaissance satellite the \u201cMalligyong-1\u201d weeks after the visit, following two failed attempts. Such satellites can help North Korea improve its ground-based military capabilities, for example enabling it to more accurately target opponents\u2019 forces with its own missiles.  United Nations member states are barred from directly or indirectly aiding North Korea\u2019s missile programs as well as engaging in arms transfers with Pyongyang. But Kim is also eyeing access to know-how for a range of Russian advanced weaponry, experts say, as well as technology linked to uranium enrichment, reactor designs or nuclear propulsion for submarines. The North Korean leader sees his weapons programs as essential to the survival of his regime, according to analysts. \u201cKim Jong Un will be interested in asking the world from Russia, whether he\u2019ll get that or not is another question,\u201d said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington. It\u2019s unlikely that Putin would be \u201ctoo eager to necessarily initiate cooperation on those issues (nuclear related technologies) when there\u2019s a long list of less sensitive technologies that the Russians can part with\u201d like improving radar or surface-to-air missile systems, he said. When asked last week about Western concerns that Russia is considering the transfer of sensitive technologies to Pyongyang, a Kremlin spokesperson said the countries\u2019 \u201cpotential for developing bilateral relations\u201d was \u201cprofound\u201d and \u201cshould not cause concern to anyone and should not and cannot be challenged by anyone.\u201d \u2018A tragic world\u2019 However, any support from Putin \u2013 a leader of a UN Security Council permanent member state \u2013 is a significant boon for Kim, who is deeply isolated on the world stage. For Putin, too, the visit is an opportunity to send a signal, or a threat, that Russia is not alone. \u201cPutin is highlighting that Russia has friends \u2013 and is propagating the idea that the war is not winnable for Ukraine because Russia will not run out of weapons,\u201d said John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation non-profit in Washington. The Russian leader may also see the relationship with Kim as a way to raise the specter of nuclear war, exploiting \u201cUS and South Korean concerns about North Korea,\u201d so that \u201cUkraine\u2019s friends will compel it to seek a negotiated \u2018solution\u2019 on Russia\u2019s terms,\u201d Erath added. Putin laid out his peace conditions on Friday ahead of a Ukraine-backed international peace summit over the weekend that Russia did not attend. They included the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four partially occupied regions \u2013 a position seen as nonstarter by Kyiv and its allies. And in his letter published in North Korea state media ahead of the visit, Putin framed the two countries as both facing down what he called US efforts to impose a \u201cneocolonialist dictatorship\u201d over the world. Observers agree that Putin is unlikely at this point to directly help North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, as neither Putin nor his close partner Xi want to see nuclear confrontation in the region. But it\u2019s also become clear that growing North Korea-Russia ties, as well as the widening chasm between Russia, China and the West, is impacting international efforts to control North Korea\u2019s weapons program. Russia in March vetoed a UN resolution to renew an independent panel of experts investigating the country\u2019s violations of Security Council sanctions. China abstained from the vote. Both countries in recent years have blocked movement in the council related to North Korea as they grew skeptical of US-backed sanctions. Deepening divisions today contrast collaboration in recent decades between Russia, China and the US, according to former US Ambassador to Russia and National Security Council official Michael McFaul. He pointed to his experiences during the former US President Barack Obama administration working on nonproliferation efforts related to North Korea and Iran. \u201c(Then) we were cooperating with the Russians on both of these fronts \u2026 we were meeting, we had the same objectives \u2026 and the Chinese were with us on lockstep on both of those accounts,\u201d McFaul said in a podcast last month hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. \u201cNow look at where we\u2019re at today, completely the opposite \u2026 we\u2019re not cooperating at all on either of those accounts \u2026 that is a brand-new world and a tragic world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/china/north-korea-russia-putin-kim-visit-ukraine-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

As the heat of summer gathers, hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are contending with a crisis in sanitation. Ismail Zayda, who lives in Gaza City in the north, told CNN that water supplies had been cut off for nine months. \u201cThe municipalities are not working, and waste in large piles is on our doorsteps and on the roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing large quantities of flying insects for the first time\u2026 Frankly, we have insects that we see for the first time and we do not know their names, and they sting our bodies and the bodies of our children.\u201d Israel\u2019s relentless bombardment of Gaza \u2013 launched in the wake of the October 7 attacks \u2013 is now into its eighth month and has triggered a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Human rights groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm over \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions for Palestinians, as Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. There is little sign of a resolution to the protracted and bloody conflict. A US-backed ceasefire plan was overwhelmingly approved by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) this week. But neither side has accepted it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that he will continue until Hamas is destroyed and the remaining hostages are freed. In an assessment this week, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated that in Deir al Balah in central Gaza, where thousands of displaced are sheltering, families say that shelters are overcrowded. They have reported a range of health issues, such as hepatitis A, skin diseases, and respiratory illnesses and say that access to water is also critically low. At one displacement site, the average amount of water available per day was less than one liter per person, well below the internationally recognized minimum requirement for survival of three litres per day, according to OCHA. A safe water supply is essential not just for drinking and cooking, but to prevent the spread of disease. OCHA reported this week that more than two-thirds of water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged due to the conflict. It added many other facilities are out of service due to challenges including \u201cinsecurity, access impediments, and lack of power and fuel to operate generators.\u201d OCHA said that people\u2019s coping mechanisms are \u201cheavily stretched,\u201d with the most vulnerable collecting water from unreliable sources in inadequate containers, while lacking basic hygiene items like soap. The average high temperature in Gaza in the coming week is expected to be in the low 30 degrees celsius, with warmer weather likely to worsen what is already a crisis in sanitation. Roads \u2018full of sewage\u2019 Zayda, the Gaza City resident, told how an out-of-service swimming pool in his had become a magnet for insects. \u201cDuring the day, flies come, and at night, mosquitoes spread\u2026 We light fires at night and burn garbage until the flying insects disappear.\u201d Zayda spends much of the day wearing a mask, partly because some vehicles run on burned frying oil as an alternative to diesel, making breathing difficult. \u201cThe roads are full of sewage running through the streets, waste and rubble from the bombing,\u201d he said. The treatment of sewage amid damage to infrastructure and a lack of fuel has become an enduring problem in Gaza. Carl Skau, Deputy Executive Director of the World Food Programme, said after a tour of Gaza this week\u00a0that a million people have been pushed out of Rafah and are now \u201ctrapped\u201d in a \u201chighly congested area along the beach in the burning summer heat.\u201d \u201cWe drove through rivers of sewage,\u201d he said. According to the OCHA, the delivery of some fuel supplies has helped reduce the level of accumulated wastewater in the Sheikh Radwan area in Gaza City, but \u201cthe lack of a steady flow of fuel creates a continued risk of sewage overflow into neighbouring areas.\u201d Assem Al-Nabih, media officer for the Gaza City Municipality, told CNN there is now \u201ca leakage of large quantities of sewage in various parts of the city and also into the sea.\u201d \u201cThere is significant damage to the sewer lines and sewage pumps, this has led to the leakage of sewage and wastewater throughout the city.\u201d He estimated that more than 4 kilometers of water pipelines had been destroyed or damaged, an immense stretch to repair in the middle of a war. According to assessments by UN agencies and partner organizations published in the last week, 67% of water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged due to conflict. There are sporadic efforts to repair infrastructure. The Coastal Municipalities Water Utility, in partnership with the International Committee of the Red Cross, has restored several wells in Khan Younis, Deir Al Balah and Nuseirat. But the scale of the task, without a ceasefire and with limited fuel supplies and equipment, is far beyond the capability of local authorities in Gaza.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/middleeast/gaza-health-crisis-mosquitoes-sewage-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Minutes after his bus was\u00a0stopped at a checkpoint in the coastal region of Urab\u00e1, he was dragged off, beaten to death in front of his fellow passengers, and dumped on the side of the road \u2013 where his killers covered his corpse with a\u00a0banana plant.\u00a0Cows would later feed on his body, according to court documents. The brutality did not end there. His\u00a0daughter and\u00a0sister-in-law\u00a0disappeared weeks later, never to be found again. Death threats were made to another member of the family. What was left of the family soon left Urab\u00e1 for good. He\u00a0was just one of thousands of people targeted by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, an infamous right-wing terrorist group that, at the height of Colombia\u2019s civil conflict around the turn of the century, was able to mobilize tens of thousands of fighters. More than a quarter century\u00a0later, a landmark civil case in a US federal court this week found banana company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing the\u00a0paramilitary\u00a0group, and ordered Chiquita\u00a0to pay $38.3 million in compensation to \u201cDavid\u2019s\u201d family and those of\u00a0seven other victims \u2013 whose real identities were concealed in court documents. The details of those deaths, which took place between 1997 and 2004, and accounts of\u00a0the impact they had on the families, were read to jurors before\u00a0they deliberated whether Chiquita \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest banana producers \u2013 had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson\u201d by paying the AUC what the company characterized as extortion payments. The families\u00a0argued\u00a0that\u00a0payments from Chiquita to the AUC had helped to prop up the paramilitary group\u2019s violence in Colombia and that the company should therefore be held liable for the group\u2019s murders. The verdict\u00a0has been celebrated as a legal breakthrough.\u00a0According to the lawyers who won the case in Florida, it marks \u201cthe first time an American jury has held a major US corporation accountable for complicity in serious human rights abuses in another country.\u201d \u201cI feel great joy, we waited for so long and suddenly, we won. I had almost lost hope, but God helped us,\u201d one of the plaintiffs told CNN after the ruling. The mother of four daughters\u00a0recalled telling\u00a0the court how her partner\u00a0was\u00a0killed by AUC paramilitaries on November 14, 2003, to pressure the family to sell a banana plantation at below market rate. \u201cI don\u2019t want the money myself, I\u2019ll be gone soon\u2026 but at least, for the girls: may they get some justice now!\u201d she said of the compensation. A bellwether case? The verdict follows a nearly two-decade judicial fight by the families, who sued Chiquita International after a separate court case in 2007.\u00a0In\u00a0that case,\u00a0the company admitted paying $1.7 million in \u201cprotection money\u201d to the AUC \u2013 at that time considered a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department \u2013 and agreed to pay the US government a $25 million fine. However, it\u2019s unlikely to be the last of the matter, and not only because Chiquita has already said it will appeal the verdict. Marco Simons, general counsel for Earth Rights International, a human rights NGO that provided legal assistance to the victims, described his legal strategy as a \u201cbellwether process,\u201d with his team selecting the nine strongest cases they had from over 4,500 complaints. He now hopes many more cases will follow. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to represent these victims for the past 17 years. It\u2019s not over yet, but this is a significant step forward, and we hope that this will pave the way for compensation for all the victims,\u201d Simons told a press conference in Washington on Tuesday. Because of Chiquita\u2019s appeal, Simons says it is unlikely any of the victims will receive compensation soon, however, he says the case has sent a strong message to corporations about the need to respect human rights. \u201cUltimately, this money is not going to replace what\u2019s been lost. We\u2019re still talking about horrific abuses that these families have suffered, but the money is important because, unfortunately, the language that corporations understand best is money. Sometimes it takes a significant monetary penalty to change corporate behavior,\u201d Simons said. \u2018Tragic for so many\u2019 Chiquita has maintained in its defense \u2013 both throughout the latest case and in previous litigation \u2013 that it was itself a victim, as it had been forced to pay the AUC protection money. While that argument was not enough to\u00a0convince\u00a0the jury that it had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson would have acted under the circumstances,\u201d the company told CNN following the latest verdict that it remained \u201cconfident that our legal position will ultimately prevail.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Colombia was tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families. However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\u201d the statement read. In its 2007 case against the US Justice Department, the company\u00a0admitted making more than \u201c100 payments to the AUC totaling over $1.7 million.\u201d\u00a0Chiquita recorded the AUC payments as \u201csecurity services,\u201d though the company never received any actual services from these payments,\u00a0according\u00a0to a US Justice Department press release from the time. Eric Holder, who represented Chiquita in the 2007 trial before serving as US Attorney General under President\u00a0Barack Obama, told the court then\u00a0that: \u201cThe company had to pay a variety of terrorist groups for over 15 years because those were the groups that controlled the areas in which the company operated. Not the Colombian government.\u201d However, in that trial, the company ended up admitting in a plea deal that it had willingly continued to pay the AUC even after the group was declared a terrorist organization by the US government in 2001, and even after a senior director lodged an objection to Chiquita\u2019s board reiterating \u201chis strong opinion to sell our operations in Colombia,\u201d due to the protection money issue. Federal attorneys found that Chiquita made $49.4 million in profit from their Colombian operations between 1997 and 2004. A time of \u2018real terror\u2019 The AUC was founded in 1997, during one of the most tragic phases of the Colombian civil conflict, which saw the government wrestle for control against left-wing guerrilla forces, right-wing paramilitaries, and criminal organizations. Around that time, left-wing guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) were moving against the state and terrorizing the civilian population.\u00a0Chiquita said in the 2007 case that it had paid ransoms to the FARC and ELN\u00a0before it turned to the AUC in 1997. Faced with the possibility of an armed communist revolution in the country, Colombian landowners and right-wing sympathizers created groups of\u00a0vigilantes\u00a0to respond to the guerrillas blow for blow. The AUC were once such a\u00a0group and spent the years before their final demobilization\u00a0in 2006 terrorizing the population of northern Colombia to stem the rebellion. At its zenith, the AUC could mobilize tens of thousands of fighters, and was heavily financed by drug trafficking: following demobilization, more than a dozen AUC leaders were extradited on drug charges to the US. \u201cI remember that period, it was real terror,\u201d one of the plaintiffs awarded compensation on Monday told CNN. \u201cMy husband was killed, but my daughter was also raped, you had victims all across town.\u201d In other testimony heard by the jurors in the most recent court case, a minor\u00a0girl\u00a0was forced to watch from a taxi as her mother and stepfather were executed on the side of the street, before being given the equivalent of less than a dollar to return home and survive as an orphan. Colombia today Colombia today is a vastly different country to the one in which the AUC was born. A few years after the demobilization of the AUC, a peace deal in 2016 also brought to an end the 52-year conflict between the government and the FARC, though some dissidents continue to fight. Both right wing paramilitaries and left-wing guerrillas have since been included in transitional justice processes aimed at bringing closure to some of the darkest pages of the conflict. Yet the fear in Urab\u00e1 remains. Some of the AUC\u2019s former members remain at large and have joined a new organized criminal group, the Gulf Clan, that challenges government control in northwestern Colombia. Rights groups say powerful corporate interests continue to collude with local politicians and criminal groups to repress activism, particularly in defense of the environment, which can be a dangerous business in South America. Even so, for at least some of the many victims of the AUC, this week\u2019s court verdict is a reason for optimism.\u00a0One of the plaintiffs who spoke with CNN asked to share her message as an act of defiance. \u201cMy daughter, my son, they\u2019re all \u2018Mom don\u2019t pick up the phone, mom don\u2019t talk.\u2019 But hey, fear can only last until someone decides to speak,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba", "text": "In twelve years of living in Cuba, I have waited in all kinds of lines. Lines to buy food, lines to pay bills, lines just because people were lining up for something maybe worth lining up for. But now I was in a line for something unexpected:\u00a0to\u00a0board\u00a0a Russian warship docked in Havana\u2019s harbor. When a Russian diplomat told me that starting on Thursday, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate would offer tours to the public for three days, I was somewhat skeptical. The Gorshkov is one of the most modern vessels in the Russian fleet, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. I had trouble imagining that\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin\u2019s prized\u00a0ship would be opened for anyone to see. When the Gorshkov arrived in Cuba\u00a0on Wednesday, it fired a deafening\u00a021-shot\u00a0salute.\u00a0The\u00a0Cubans answered with cannon fire from an 18th\u00a0century fortress overlooking the harbor that the Spanish had built to protect the city from pirates. With the frigate came a rescue tug, a fuel ship and the Kazan, an imposing nuclear-powered submarine. Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Defense said that none of the ships were carrying nuclear weapons and that they did not represent \u201ca threat to the region,\u201d clearly meaning the US, Cuba\u2019s neighbor 90 miles to the\u00a0north. But for many Cubans, the visit of the largest convoy of ships in years from their old Cold War ally seemed like a return to the past, particularly as Moscow and Washington increasingly spar over the war in Ukraine. \u201cI never thought I would see a Russian submarine so up close,\u201d said a Cuban man next to me as we waited in line in view of the four\u00a0vessels. We were standing outside the port terminal in Havana which,\u00a0just years earlier,\u00a0had been full\u00a0of\u00a0US cruise ships, until then-President Donald Trump banned their visits to the island\u00a0in 2019. Even though a line had formed, it was not clear if any of us waiting there were going to get aboard. An hour passed in the broiling Cuban sun. \u201cWe are roasting out here,\u201d a woman carrying a small baby next to me said. Cubans are champion line-waiters and I worried that I would have nothing to show for my interlude outside the port other than a worsening sunburn. Finally, a Cuban Navy official in a sparkling white uniform came out to speak to us, resting his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou can go aboard but need to leave any sharp objects like knives, scissors or hair clippers behind,\u201d he said. Two plainclothes\u00a0state\u00a0security officers began to run everyone\u2019s\u00a0identity card numbers through a database on their phones. I handed my\u00a0carn\u00e9,\u00a0or\u00a0ID card,\u00a0that lists my birthplace in the US to one of the officers who appeared too young to shave. He looked at my\u00a0carn\u00e9\u00a0and turned to his older colleague for advice. \u201cAre we letting foreign residents on board?\u201d\u00a0he asked. The older officer,\u00a0who was wearing a New York Yankee\u2019s baseball cap,\u00a0nodded and then ran my card information through the database. \u201cYou can go ahead,\u201d he said. Inside the port, past officials manning a metal detector, Russian sailors in dark blue unforms waited to take a group of about\u00a020\u00a0of us aboard the Gorshkov. In front of the ship, the sailors had posted a sign in English that declared the Gorshkov\u2019s \u201cmain purpose\u201d was \u201ccombat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines.\u201d The Russian sailors spoke more English than Spanish and I occasionally translated to help the other members of our group, who were\u00a0all\u00a0Cuban. We were told we could film and everyone immediately took out their smartphones to snap videos and selfies. We started out on the ship\u2019s massive helicopter pad and then walked through the ship to the bow. Every few feet a Russian sailor stood keeping watch. At the front of the ship, one of the sailors\u00a0showed me an anti-rocket system\u00a0to be used\u00a0in the unlikely event we came under attack. I asked about the massive cannon and the sailor replied that it could fire shells a distance of 23 kilometers,\u00a0or about 15 miles. A level up, where there appeared to be sensitive communications equipment, a Russian soldier in tactical gear with an assault rifle at his side looked down at us. Just off the bow we could see an unobstructed view of the Kazan, the 430-foot long submarine that stretched out into the harbor. I noticed one of the Russian sailors taking in the blue skies and calm waters around us. \u201cCuba good?\u201d I ask him. \u201cCuba good,\u201d he laughs in reply and gives me a thumbs up. The war in Ukraine has\u00a0severely\u00a0degraded the Russian fleet and once again pitted the US and Russia on opposite sides of a bloody conflict. For a Russian sailor, Cuba could be as good as it gets these days. I disembarked the Russian warship in Havana feeling that the Cold War did not seem like such a distant memory, when I saw an alert flash across my phone. It was an announcement that the Pentagon had just dispatched its own nuclear powered attack submarine\u00a0to the other side of the island:\u00a0the US Navy Base in Guantanamo\u00a0Bay,\u00a0Cuba, slightly more than 500 miles away from the where the Russian ships are docked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_style_martine-rose-brings-a-slice-of-london-to-milan-fashion-week", "text": "With flyers strewn across the floor, metal barriers covered in recycled plastic, and a sporadic assembly of plastic chairs arranged in dimly-lit arts space south of central Milan, British menswear designer Martine Rose eschewed the polish often associated with the Italian fashion capital, giving guests a taste of her native North London\u2019s gritty charm instead. \u201cI wanted it to be a bit of a mess,\u201d said Rose ahead of the show on Sunday that marked her debut on the Milan Fashion Week schedule after years presenting her label in London. \u201cI want people to go in into it and there be this beauty but not in a [instantly] recognizable [way].\u201d This subverted starting point is a longstanding signature of Rose\u2019s brand and one that has no doubt contributed to her being one of the most sought-after and influential designers of her generation. In addition to running her business \u2014 one that remained independent since its launch in 2007 until The Tomorrow Group invested in 2021 \u2014 she has consulted behind the scenes for prominent fashion houses including Balenciaga, been shortlisted for the prestigious LVMH Fashion Prize, among many others, and picked up the coveted Menswear Designer of The Year trophy at the 2023 Fashion Awards. For her Spring-Summer 2025 show, she continued to challenge traditional concepts of masculinity and classic codes of tailoring. Dedicated to \u201cexpressions of beauty spawned from the likes of disturbance, humour, and sex,\u201d according to show notes, the collection saw whipstitched T-shirts worn with tartan shorts and fishnet socks; a \u201cparty shirt\u201d featuring the headshots of Rose\u2019s studio team and their families; and tailoring taken out of proportion with nipped-in waists and broad-shouldered blazers worn with leather pants featuring front zips \u201cfor easy access.\u201d \u201cThere is a familiar subversion but I never intend for things to be shocking,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe things that I put on the on the catwalk I genuinely think are real proposals for men.\u201d Case in point, the sporty polo shirts and hot-pink cagoules that came perfectly tucked into pencil skirts. \u201cThere\u2019s something somehow more radical in a man wearing a pencil skirt and I\u2019m curious as to why, because there\u2019s nothing particularly radical about the sober length and we see Bermuda shorts and kilts of that length,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThese are the questions that I find really interesting, not about gender but about clothes. And the men look amazing in it.\u201d In a further twist, prosthetic noses were administered to every model, each of whom had been street cast in Milan. Rose does this for all her shows, reemphasising the importance of the \u201clocal hero,\u201d a phrase that appeared as logos on baseball caps and silk ties. Milan is something of a fitting host for Rose\u2019s brand with the two sharing a sense of intrigue on first impression. While Milan\u2019s austere architecture famously conceals its hidden gardens and a warm hospitality, the confronting setting and external attitude of Rose\u2019s catwalk shows are portals to a creative conversation that has community at its heart. As Rose notes of Milan, \u201cit reveals itself slowly\u201d. That Rose opted to show her collection in Milan this season (off the back of showing in Florence and Paris previously) as opposed to London, deals another blow to the British Fashion Council\u2019s (BFC) menswear schedule that was once a hotbed of emerging talent but has lost a number of key brands including JW Anderson, A-Cold-Wall and Wales Bonner, to other fashion weeks over the last six years. \u201cYou would think that I would come back and appreciate London more, but actually it makes me realise what London has lost and continues to lose,\u201d she said in reference to what she sees as a lack of investment in the industry. \u201cEvery other European city seems to take [creativity] seriously and that makes me sad. And then of course, layer on Brexit, and it\u2019s actually a disaster for all of the creative sector.\u201d Despite the direct value of the UK fashion industry to the UK economy standing at nearly \u00a321 billion (approximately $27 billion), according to the BFC, and fashion graduates taking top positions at international fashion houses for decades, Rose said, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly infuriating and depressing that it\u2019s not taken seriously. As soon as you get any particular type of sort of success and recognition, you have to move to Paris or Italy to get seen, the natural thing is to leave London and that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \u201cThere are [designers] doing really interesting stuff, it\u2019s just that they get no support from anywhere else to do it,\u201d she continued. \u201cRents are impossible, they get no subsidies\u2026it\u2019s off people\u2019s own bat, which is really hard to sustain.\u201d Following the rapturous reception at Sunday\u2019s show, it appears that London\u2019s loss is Milan\u2019s gain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/style/martine-rose-brings-a-slice-of-london-to-milan-fashion-week/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

With the scores level at 1-1 in the second half, the Real Madrid star picked the ball up from approximately 25 yards before curling a beautiful effort into the top corner of the net. The 65th-minute strike sparked frenzied scenes inside the Signal Iduna Park, with thousands of Turkey fans celebrating arguably the goal of the tournament so far. It was a devastating blow for Georgia, though, which is making its debut at a major soccer tournament. Despite being the lowest ranked team at Euro 2024, its players can count themselves unlucky having pushed Turkey all the way in its opening group stage match. A brilliant volley from Mert M\u00fcld\u00fcr had given Turkey a 25th-minute lead, but Georgia equalized soon after when Georges Mikautadze\u2019s shot squirmed into the net. Georgia came excruciatingly close to snatching a dramatic late equalizer, before Kerem Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu made it 3-1 in the final seconds, putting the ball into an empty net after Georgian goalkeeper Giorgi\u00a0Mamardashvili had gone forward for a corner.

{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_germany-first-veterans-day-intl", "text": "Germany is marking its first Veterans\u2019 Day since World War Two on Saturday,\u00a0a once unthinkable move that\u00a0sets\u00a0aside long-standing unease over the honoring of its soldiers. In a sign of the \u201cZeitenwende,\u201d or \u201cchanging of the times,\u201d that Germany is\u00a0undergoing in the wake of the Ukraine war, the country is actively seeking to increase the prestige of its military. Germany has for decades felt uncomfortable over such pageantry given the role of its soldiers in World War II and the Holocaust. But a\u00a0bill to introduce an annual national Veterans\u2019 Day was voted in on April 25 after being approved by nearly all parties in the German parliament. Only the far-left Die Linke party raised objections.\u00a0Party co-chairman Ates G\u00fcrpinar implied this was due to the party\u2019s pacifist stance. \u201cWe on the left reject this Veterans\u2019 Day,\u201d\u00a0he told CNN in a statement.\u00a0\u201cIt is based on cheap symbolic politics and at the same time ensures the minister of defense\u2019s promise of war-readiness.\u201d\u00a0 The new legislation states that the day should be celebrated \u201cpublicly and visibly\u201d every year on June 15.\u00a0It\u00a0also\u00a0mandates improvements to services providing mental and physical care for veterans, including rehabilitation and therapy. The commemorations, modeled on Armed Forces Day in the UK and Veterans Day in the US, will honor all Germans who have worn military uniform \u2013 not only those wounded or killed in combat.\u00a0Germany has around 10 million veterans, according to its ministry of defense.\u00a0 Defense Minister Boris Pistorius described the move as a \u201cstrong, important and, yes, an overdue signal of recognition and appreciation.\u201d During the Cold War, Soviet-occupied East Germany celebrated its National People\u2019s Army with military parades. An equivalent was never established in the West. Following the end of World War II,\u00a0the first combat mission in which\u00a0German soldiers took part was the Kosovo War in the late 1990s.\u00a0Since then\u00a0the most significant deployments of\u00a0the\u00a0German armed forces, or Bundeswehr,\u00a0have been in Afghanistan and Mali. But the biggest spur to creating a Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day has been Ukraine. Germany was initially reluctant to send heavy weaponry to Kyiv for fear of becoming directly involved in the war, but eventually bowed to international pressure. Now, Berlin is the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine. \u201cThe war against Ukraine has created the need for a significant build-up of the Bundeswehr (armed forces), increased spending and also recruitment,\u201d Johannes Kiess, a sociologist at the University of Leipzig, told CNN.\u00a0It was\u00a0an opportunity, he\u00a0added,\u00a0that made it appear appropriate to upgrade the military \u201csymbolically\u201d as well. A relationship of respect This Saturday, the day will be marked with an event in Berlin. From next year, commemorations will take place nationwide. Johannes Arlt, a former soldier who was deployed four times to Afghanistan and three times to Mali from 2014 to 2019, is now a lawmaker for the ruling center-left Social Democrats (SPD). He played a prominent role in forming the new Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day bill. Speaking to CNN, Arlt said he\u00a0experienced first-hand the lack of recognition of the Bundeswehr in German society, particularly for deployments abroad, but acknowledged that this appears to have changed in recent times. \u201cFor a long time, there appeared to be a sparse interest in people who served abroad, and there used to be little empathy, but we find that the population now has a great deal of respect for the Bundeswehr.\u201d Arlt explains he believes a Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day in Germany is important to \u201ccommemorate military service \u2013 in all its facets \u2013 and thank the men and women who are committed to security in our country.\u201d Arlt said he experienced horrors during his military service abroad that he would not wish anyone to witness. \u201cI had my worst experiences in Mali in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI flew a drone and saw all the things that others didn\u2019t see on the front line. I was also present at massacres and had to watch these things and couldn\u2019t do anything. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\u201d Mental health support leaves \u2018room for improvement\u2019 Part of the reason for the move is to improve the health services offered to soldiers returning from assignments overseas, as well as\u00a0to\u00a0raise awareness of what they have to endure. Army veteran Andreas Eggert served in the Bundeswehr from 1999-2013, first in Kosovo and then in Afghanistan. He was diagnosed with PTSD in 2013 and went into rehabilitation in 2014. He is welcoming the efforts to improve aftercare for soldiers, many of whom are left with physical or psychological damage. \u201cMental illness was still frowned upon in my time, especially if you were in a specialized assignment like I was, it was difficult to deal with it openly,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut I did it back then, in 2013, I spoke out it openly and was criticized a lot for it.\u201d Eggert says that he has seen the Bundeswehr\u2019s rehabilitation programs improve over the years, but there is still work to be done. \u201c[The programs] are not optimal, and the care is not optimal either. There are not enough therapists, especially not in the Bundeswehr. The Bundeswehr hospitals that do a good job are often overstretched\u2026 There is a lot of room for improvement.\u201d Regardless of the debate around marking Veterans\u2019 Day,\u00a0it is clear the country has had to adapt its anti-militaristic stance in recent years. Pistorius has previously warned that Germany needs to prepare for a worst-case scenario regarding the specter\u00a0of war in Europe. He has also not ruled out introducing some form of military conscription. For now, though, the soldiers CNN spoke to were simply grateful for the acknowledgment. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as a hero, quite the opposite, but what I have missed is a time or even a day when we can also remember those who have fallen during their assignments,\u201d\u00a0said 42-year-old Stefan Huss, an active soldier who twice served in Afghanistan.

Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\u00a0plundered the facility on Saturday stealing an ambulance among other supplies, the aid agency said. \u201cOn Saturday, MSF and the Ministry of Health suspended all activities in South Hospital, El Fasher, North Darfur, after RSF soldiers stormed the facility, opened fire, and looted it, including stealing an MSF ambulance,\u201d MSF Sudan said on social media Saturday. The hospital was the only one in the region \u201cequipped to deal with mass casualties\u201d and \u201cwas the main referral hospital for treating war-wounded.\u201d It was also one of the two hospitals in El Fasher with surgical capacity, according to MSF. As a result, patients are being moved to Paediatric and Saudi hospitals \u201cwhich were unprepared for such an influx,\u201d it added. Video posted on an apparent RSF \u201cX\u201d account shows armed men at the front gate of South Hospital. The footage was geolocated by CNN and shows at least one man firing an AK-style weapon on hospital grounds. According to MSF\u2019s statement posted on Twitter,\u00a0only ten patients and a small medical team were at the hospital\u00a0when it was attacked. Medical teams had already begun transferring patients and services to other facilities earlier in the week after intensified fighting in the region, the MSF said. Images posted to social media and verified by CNN show damaged medical equipment strewn in and around the facility. In one video, an armed man poses inside what appears to be an ambulance parked outside South Hospital. It is unclear whether the vehicle belonged to MSF. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment. MSF said most patients and the remaining medical team, which included all MSF staff, were able to flee the violence but they are unable to say for certain if there were any casualties due to the chaos that ensued. South Hospital is the latest medical facility to fall into warring factions\u2019 crosshairs in Darfur. The medical facility had already been hit by mortar shells and bullets multiple times in the preceding weeks between May 25th\u00a0and June 3rd\u00a0resulting in two deaths and 14 injuries among patients and caretakers, according to MSF. On May 11, nearby Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital was impacted by an SAF airstrike 50 meters from the facility, per an MSF press release. Two children and a care giver in the intensive care unit were killed in the strike after a roof collapsed. \u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\u201d said MSF\u2019s Head of Emergencies Michel Lacharite, as quoted by MSF Sudan on X Saturday. \u201cWarring parties must halt attacks on medical care. Hospitals are closing. Remaining facilities can\u2019t handle mass casualties. We are trying to find solutions. The responsibility is on warring parties to spare medical facilities,\u201d Lacharite added. Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy of the EU Nabila Massrali\u00a0said on X Sunday,\u00a0\u201cThe EU is appalled by RSF-Janjaweed assault of staff at the El Fasher South Hospital in Darfur also looting it, as it did with many other hospitals in Sudan.\u201d \u201cWe remind again the [RSF] to show restraint and respect International Humanitarian Law,\u201d she added. The United Nations (UN) has said\u00a0that El Fasher hosts around 1.8 million people who are at \u201cimminent risk of famine.\u201d The UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration (IOM)\u00a0said an escalation in fighting from April 1st\u00a0this year between the warring RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) was monitored across El Fasher, displacing almost 130,000 people in just April and May this year. Civil war in Sudan between the SAF and RSF broke out in April 2023. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since the war\u2019s outbreak more than 8.8 million people have fled their homes and 24.8 million people are in need of assistance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/africa/sudans-al-fashir-main-hospital-shut-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

It was a glimmer of familial normality in Gaza for a nine-year-old and her younger sibling that ended in tragedy. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear its whizzing or anything, I only saw a red light when the missile fell,\u201d Hanan recalls from her hospital bed in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza. Her voice is hoarse and cracked, following reconstructive surgery to her face. She has 20% burns to her face, hands, chest, and leg. Her sister, five-year-old Leene, who was walking ahead of her, escaped injury. \u201cThere was a man next to me dismembered and bleeding and a block of building cement fell on me,\u201d Hanan says. Hanan is one of thousands of critically ill patients waiting for medical evacuation from Gaza but unable to leave following the closure of the Rafah crossing to Egypt in early May. After the airstrike, her father rushed her to hospital, where she also had surgery to remove shrapnel from her face. Her doctor, Mahmoud Mahane, specializes in burns and eye injuries, but says there is nothing more they can do for her inside Gaza. \u201cMost children need medical transfers,\u201d he says, \u201cfor a more qualified treatment than here, as we don\u2019t have the treatment or tools and we don\u2019t have the supplies, we lack these supplies.\u201d Eight months of war have decimated the Gazan health system. Tens of thousands of injured Palestinians and a severe lack of medicine, doctors, and electricity, have proved a lethal combination. The only hope for many is to be evacuated through the Rafah crossing into Egypt and get treatment in neighboring countries. That lifeline has been cut off since May 7 when the Israeli military took\u00a0control of the crossing and closed it. Egypt says it will not open the crossing until the Israeli military withdraws. It cites security reasons \u2013 one Egyptian soldier was killed last month in fighting along the border. Israel says it will not hand over control of the crossing to Palestinian authorities, fearing Hamas would use the area to smuggle in weapons. 10,000 need evacuating Rik Peeperkorn is the World Health Organization\u2019s representative for the West Bank and Gaza. He says there are at least 10,000 urgent cases that need to be evacuated from Gaza for treatment, adding this is likely an under-estimate given the difficulty getting accurate data. \u201cThe biggest group is the war injuries and war-related \u2026 the severe trauma, spinal injury, etc. The other biggest group is, of course, chronic conditions \u2013 oncology, cardiovascular, respiratory as well.\u201d Before the war, Peeperkorn says between 50 and 100 patients would leave daily to be treated in Jerusalem and the West Bank.\u00a0Since May 7, not one single case has been able to leave through Rafah, creating a backlog of desperation and severe cases. \u201cThe Rafah crossing should be reopened as quickly as possible,\u201d Peeperkorn says, \u201cor there should be an alternative crossing or mechanism actually applied because we cannot leave these critical patients. We have no estimation at the moment how many of the patients which should have left actually have already passed away. Before the crossing was closed on May 7, various countries \u2013 including Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, the UAE, Turkey, and parts of the European Union \u2013 had taken in critically ill cases. Some patients also continued to be transferred for treatment in Israeli hospitals after the war began, according to COGAT, Israel\u2019s body overseeing the Palestinian Territories. Peeperkorn says many have said they are ready to welcome more. But with the crossing shut, and Israel and Egypt continuing to blame each other for its continued closure, time is running out for some. In the pediatric department of Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza, the sounds of the ICU are overwhelming; a constant cacophony of beeping machines keeping newborn patients alive.

Her doctor says Malak has a heart defect and needs a complex operation considered beyond the capabilities of his hospital with its lack of fuel for generators and medicine. \u201cThe doctors did what was necessary,\u201d al-Sharqi says, \u201cbut they said that she must be transferred (out of Gaza) quickly.\u201d With tears running down her face she adds, \u201cOne of the doctors told me not to have high hopes.

{"id": "2024_06_18_asia_us-condemns-china-scs-collision-philippines-intl-hnk", "text": "The United States on Monday condemned China over a collision with the Philippines in the disputed South China Sea, the latest in a series of increasingly fraught confrontations that have raised the potential of a flashpoint for global conflict in the vital waterway. A Chinese vessel and a Philippine supply ship collided near Second Thomas Shoal in the contested\u00a0Spratly Islands early Monday, according to statements from both nations, which blamed each other for the incident. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. In a post on X, Washington\u2019s ambassador to Manila MaryKay Carlson said the US condemned China\u2019s \u201caggressive, dangerous maneuvers,\u201d which \u201ccaused bodily injury\u201d and \u201cdamaged Philippine vessels.\u201d Neither the Philippines nor China reported injuries or damage from the collision, which comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which\u00a0has repeatedly stressed Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party. The incident Monday is the latest in a string of recent confrontations between Manila and Beijing that have raised concerns among Western observers of potentially developing into an international incident if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday the \u201cUnited States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions\u201d by China. Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on Monday discussed the collision with Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Maria Theresa Lazaro. China had \u201cobstructed the Philippines from executing a lawful maritime operation in the South China Sea, interfering with the Philippines\u2019 freedom of navigation,\u201d Campbell said, according to a State Department readout. The latest incident marks the first run-in between the two countries since a new law in China took effect Saturday to authorize its coast guard to seize foreign ships and detain crews suspected of trespassing for up to 60 days without trial. The Chinese coast guard on Monday said a Philippine supply ship \u201cignored China\u2019s repeated solemn warnings\u201d and \u201cdeliberately and dangerously\u201d approached a Chinese vessel in \u201can unprofessional manner,\u201d resulting in a collision. \u201cThe Philippines is entirely responsible for this,\u201d the coast guard said in a statement, a charge rejected by the Philippine military as \u201cdeceptive and misleading.\u201d Instead, Philippine authorities accused Chinese ships of \u201cdangerous maneuvers\u201d that included \u201cramming and towing\u201d of Philippines vessels. In a statement on X, Philippine army spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said the \u201cmain issue remains to be the illegal presence and actions of Chinese vessels within the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone, which infringes on our sovereignty and sovereign rights.\u201d \u2018Dangerous and reckless behavior\u2019 In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the strategically important and resource-rich waterway. Over the past year China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by maritime militia boats \u2013 have been involved in multiple clashes that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. Known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines and Ren\u2019ai Jiao in China, Second Thomas Shoal is a submerged teardrop-shaped reef\u00a0located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Philippine island of Palawan. It lies in the Spratly Islands, a mostly uninhabited archipelago where oil and gas reserves have been found, and which is claimed by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippine ship was on a mission Monday to supply its soldiers stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert the Philippines\u2019 territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal. China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu\u00a0on Monday accused the Philippines of \u201cillegally\u201d delivering supplies to the stranded warship. In a statement, Gan said the Chinese Coast Guard took measures including \u201cwarnings and interceptions, boarding inspections and forced evictions\u201d against the Philippine vessel, adding the Chinese side handled the incident in a \u201creasonable, legal and professional\u201d manner. \u201cWe once again warn the Philippines: Any form of infringement and provocation is futile. The Chinese Coast Guard is on full alert and ready to resolutely safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,\u201d Gan said. In a departure from past confrontations with China when his team were quick to issue statements and visuals, Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela provided no comment to CNN on the collision. The Armed Forces of the Philippines also declined to give details of the latest run-in. Instead, Philippine officials made broad statements denouncing China\u2019s actions. \u201cChina\u2019s dangerous and reckless behavior in the West Philippine Sea shall be resisted by the (Armed Forces of the Philippines.) Their behavior contravenes their statements of good faith and decency,\u201d said Philippine Defense Minister Gilberto C. Teodoro, Jr. \u201cWe will exert our utmost in order to fulfill our sworn mandate to protect our territorial integrity, sovereignty, and sovereign rights. It should now be clear to the international community that China\u2019s actions are the true obstacles to peace and stability in the South China Sea.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/asia/us-condemns-china-scs-collision-philippines-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gordon Black, has appeared in court in the Russian city of Vladivostok, as his trial got underway on Monday. Black did not admit to charges of threatening to kill a Russian woman, but partially admitted guilt to theft charges, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Black was arrested in May on charges of theft in Vladivostok, where he traveled to visit the woman, believed to be his girlfriend. He is accused of stealing 10,000 rubles (roughly $112) from her when he visited Russia in April after meeting her in Korea, state news agency TASS reported. The US soldier is additionally of assaulting her during a quarrel. He was not authorized by the US Defense Department to travel to Russia and did not request official clearance to do so when he left his unit in South Korea earlier this year, according to Army spokesperson Cynthia Smith. The trial comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow, as\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u00a0rages on. There are a number of Americans being held in Russia, including two who have been declared as wrongfully detained by the US State Department \u2013 Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and former Marine\u00a0Paul Whelan. Speaking to the Pervomaisky District Court on Monday, Black said he took the 10,000 rubles (roughly $112) from the woman\u2019s purse, but the next day transferred $125 to her. He said he spent the money on food and three nights in a hotel, according to RIA. He also said the woman was to collect a deposit of 10,000 rubles from the landlord after the end of the lease of the apartment for which he was paying, RIA said. The female victim also spoke in court on Monday, saying she was not yet ready to\u00a0reconcile with the suspect since the damage had not yet been compensated.

{"id": "2024_06_14_uk_king-charles-foundation-awards-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "King Charles III was in his element this week as he celebrated a very special moment for his foundation at St. James\u2019s Palace in London. On Tuesday, the 75-year-old monarch attended the inaugural awards of his King\u2019s Foundation, so we thought, why not take our Royal News readers along with us? Now, to rewind for just a moment \u2013 King Charles set up the charity back in 1990 when he was still the Prince of Wales. His vision was to help revitalize communities while creating a balance between people and the planet. More than 30 years on, the King\u2019s ethos continues to drive the organization\u2019s projects, whether it\u2019s through its education courses focusing on arts, architecture, traditional crafts or rural skills, its health and wellbeing programs, or its regeneration work. King\u2019s Foundation chief executive Kristina Murrin told CNN that the charity is underpinned by the monarch\u2019s philosophy of working in concert with nature to \u201cbuild sustainable thriving communities.\u201d \u201cThe way we do that is we take our inspiration from nature and from tradition to try and work out what are the best ways we can work with nature, not against her.\u201d Murrin said the foundation has six historic sites in the United Kingdom \u2013 including Dumfries House and Highgrove Gardens \u2013 which together attracted nearly 300,000 visitors in the past 12 months, as well as more than a dozen sites internationally. Meanwhile, its education, skills and training programs benefited more than 15,000 students last year. This week\u2019s glittering event \u2013 set to become an annual fixture in the charity\u2019s calendar \u2013 saw rock royalty Rod Stewart and his wife, Penny Lancaster, footballing legend David Beckham, actress Sienna Miller, fashion editor Edward Enninful, supermodel Naomi Campbell and chef Raymond Blanc hand out awards. Organizers are eager to offer a platform to recognize students, teachers, alumni and partners for their contributions to the organization\u2019s efforts across a range of sectors. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about the awards. The charity has been going (for) nearly 35 years and it just felt the right moment to finally celebrate the work we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Murrin said. \u201cWe have amazing students and teachers \u2013 many of whom have gone (on) to start incredible businesses \u2013 and so it just felt it was about time we got around to celebrating some of those people.\u201d Nine awards were given out, with Charles presenting the final accolade, the King Charles III Harmony Award, to South Korean diplomat and former secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon. In a short speech, the King said the award was \u201ccreated to recognize the individuals who champion the values which underpin the King\u2019s Foundation\u2019s mission, and my own hope, for a world in which we live in harmony with nature.\u201d He then paid tribute to the former UN chief for his \u201ctireless dedication to promoting these ideals on the global stage.\u201d Some 250 guests attended the event at St. James\u2019s Palace. Pipers from the National Piping Centre and the Rock Choir played as nominees and their families made their way up the Grand Staircase to the lavish State Apartment for the reception. The awards also featured live demonstrations of some of the foundation\u2019s educational programs, including furniture-making, woodworking and embroidery. Charles was beaming as he made his way around the reception, keen to hear about how students have been supported in learning and entrepreneurship across traditional arts, textiles, rural skills, and health and wellbeing. British gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh spoke of his joy at being involved in the foundation for several decades, saying \u201cthe fact that it works\u201d continues to draw him in. He said he wants to be involved in the King\u2019s Foundation because of \u201cthe fact that it encourages practical skills \u2013 crafts, arts \u2013 that it catches people that might otherwise fall through the net and that it really makes a difference.\u201d \u201cIt makes a difference to our landscape, to the crafts and skills that are available, making sure they don\u2019t disappear, but also to individuals. It turns people around, people who are not necessarily academic but people who have really valuable skills,\u201d he added. Among the winners was Isabelle Pennington-Edmead, 27, who received the Young Entrepreneur Award from actress Sienna Miller. After graduating from the King\u2019s Foundation\u2019s The Modern Artisan program, she has gone on to set up her own eponymous label centered on a sustainable and ethical approach. Her collection \u2013 which is inspired by her mixed Caribbean Kittitian and English heritage \u2013 is made to order, cutting out unwanted stock. She will be expanding onto an online retailer this summer while scaling up her business sustainably. She told CNN that setting up her business \u201cwas something I\u2019d always wanted to do and when I left the King\u2019s Foundation, I felt that I had the tools to be able to do it.\u201d In the Throne Room, Charles had the chance to catch up with Beckham, who was recently announced as a new ambassador for the foundation and who mentioned at the event that he had cuts on his hands from planting roses over the weekend. The pair appeared delighted to see each other again, discussing the England men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s prospects ahead of the Euro 2024 tournament, which kicks off today in Germany. Beckham assured the King \u201cwe\u2019ll be ready\u201d after a recent loss to Iceland in a friendly. Charles may have only recently returned to public duties and is continuing his cancer treatment, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s slowed down. Murrin told CNN that King\u2019s Foundation staff had wondered how much time Charles would have to devote himself to the charity after his accession to the throne \u201cbut he stays very involved, very committed.\u201d \u201cHis Majesty is very involved and we\u2019re incredibly lucky to have him as our Royal Founding President. He was bringing attention to some of these themes around the climate, the planet, and our sustainability decades ago. It\u2019s a real honor to do his work.\u201d She added: \u201cHe loves seeing the projects that we\u2019re making out in the world \u2013 both here and across the globe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/uk/king-charles-foundation-awards-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_europe_uk-mi5-spy-agency-chinese-alert-partygate-intl-latam", "text": "A former opposition lawmaker in Britain\u2019s House of Commons has alleged that the UK\u2019s domestic spy agency MI5 may have issued a rare alert notice in 2022 about an alleged Chinese agent as a distraction from the so-called Partygate scandal, according to testimony before a tribunal looking into the alert. In the alert issued back in January 2022, MI5\u00a0alleged\u00a0Christine Ching Kui Lee had \u201cacted covertly in coordination\u201d on behalf of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party and was \u201cjudged to be involved in political interference activities in the UK.\u201d The alert was issued a day after former Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologized to the House of Commons for the Partygate scandal. Johnson\u2019s premiership came crashing down in 2022 after it emerged that numerous social gatherings took place on his watch \u2013 some of which he personally attended \u2013 at a time when Britons were living under strict rules due to Covid-19. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal in London heard on Monday that Barry Gardiner, former lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party to whom Lee donated over \u00a3500,000 (more than $600,000) between 2014 and 2020, said in a text that he had heard that the MI5 alert had been issued to \u201cdetract attention\u201d from Johnson\u2019s Partygate scandal, PA news agency reported. In a text forwarded to Lee by a friend, Gardiner said that \u201cmany people\u201d had told him \u201cthey believe the reason for putting out the story when they did was to detract attention from Boris\u2019 Partygate apology,\u201d according to PA\u2019s report. Gardiner did not specify exactly who these people making the suggestion were. Nor was any evidence provided to the tribunal Monday to back the allegations. The hearing will continue on Tuesday. CNN reached out to Gardiner\u2019s office but did not receive an immediate response. \u201cI had never believed that the Security Services would be overtly party political in that way [\u2026] What has also been suggested to me is that the Security Services may have wished to \u2018pick a fight\u2019 or to \u2018detract attention\u2019 from something else and that we were simply collateral damage,\u201d read a portion of a text from Gardiner that Lee\u2019s lawyer read out to the hearing, according to PA. CNN has also reached out to the UK\u2019s Home Office and Boris Johnson\u2019s office for comment. The MI5 alert in question\u00a0also alleged that Lee had been facilitating \u201cfinancial donations to political parties, Parliamentarians, aspiring Parliamentarians and individuals seeking political office in the UK, including facilitating donations to political entities on behalf of foreign nationals.\u201d \u201cMs Lee denies the allegations and is taking legal action against the Security Service with her son, Daniel Wilkes, who lost his job with Mr Gardiner following the alert, arguing that issuing the alert was unlawful and interfered with their human rights,\u201d PA reported. Gardiner served as a Labour MP between 1997 and 2024. He was the chairman of the now-disbanded Chinese in Britain All-Party Parliamentary Group, on which Lee sat. It was not illegal for Lee to make the donations as the UK did not have a foreign agents registration act at the time, nor was it illegal for a British citizen or foreign national working in the UK to be affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Lee is listed as a British national in the UK\u2019s corporate registry. The UK has since introduced a foreign agents registration act, which is expected to come into force later this year. In a statement to CNN in 2022, Gardiner said he had not benefited personally from Lee\u2019s donations in any way, adding that the money had been properly reported and its source verified.

{"id": "2024_06_14_africa_sudan-darfur-genocide-fears-explainer-intl", "text": "Darfur, a region in western Sudan, has a tragic history marked by ethnic violence and humanitarian crises. In the early 2000s, the area experienced a brutal conflict that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Today, there are alarming signs that Darfur may be heading towards another genocide. For more than a year, swathes of Sudan have erupted in fierce clashes between the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that have left more 14,000 people dead and displaced more than 8 million others, according to the United Nations. But their battle for territorial control has now drifted toward El Fasher, the last major town in Darfur that\u2019s yet to be conquered by the RSF. Analysts say it\u2019s only a matter of days before El Fasher falls to the rebels. What\u2019s happening in Darfur? Ethnic-related killings have intensified in Darfur since fighting broke out in mid-April last year between the rival military factions. The RSF, which evolved from the Arab Janjaweed militia that spearheaded the genocide of the early 2000s, killing an estimated 300,000 people, has however, targeted the Masalit ethnic group and other non-Arab communities. Reports indicate widespread atrocities, including mass killings, sexual violence, and the systematic destruction of villages. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented these abuses, which have been likened to ethnic cleansing campaigns. The violence has forced tens of thousands of people to flee, many seeking refuge in neighboring Chad, the UN Refugee Agency said. At least 134 people were killed in El Fasher last month after gunfire rang out in the city and bombs fell on civilian homes as RSF fighters encircled the town. Last week, North Darfur\u2019s main hospital in El Fasher was also forced to close after the RSF raided the facility and looted vital supplies. The hospital had previously been hit by bullets and mortar shells. Indicators of genocide The RSF is headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, also known as Hemedti, a former leader of the Janjaweed militia. Analysts told CNN that the targeted nature of the violence in Darfur, the systematic approach of the RSF, and the historical context of ethnic conflicts in the region all suggest that the situation could evolve into another genocide. The intent to destroy the Masalit people and other non-Arab groups mirrors the patterns of violence that characterized the genocide of the early 2000s, said Sudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali. \u201cThe RSF uses systematic dehumanization method against non-Arabs in Darfur, saying,\u00a0\u2018these are dirt, dogs and monkeys\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s kill the babies and males because if they grow up, they will fight us back.\u2019 There is a systematic policy of dehumanization .. the same explicit incitement from since the early 2000s,\u201d said Ali, a legal adviser at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. In April, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, warned that \u201cprevailing signs of genocide\u201d and \u201cgrave human rights violations and abuses continue to be reported against innocent civilian populations\u201d in Sudan. \u201cMost of the atrocities that are committed today\u00a0are by the same actors in the early 2000s.\u00a0The RSF is rebranded Janjaweed militia: same commanders, same ethnic tribes, and the same victim groups (non-Arab communities) in Darfur\u00a0that are being systematically targeted by the RSF,\u201d Ali told CNN. He added: \u201cWe see that the perpetrators are documenting their abuses by themselves. Back in the day, there were no cell\u00a0phones,\u00a0and (abuses) were primarily documented by human rights organizations that were in Sudan.\u00a0But this time, they document killing people, burning villages, and their incitement.\u201d Weapons support from regional powers Ali says that technology and sophisticated weaponry are the only peculiarities that differentiate the RSF\u2019s current atrocities from the genocide committed by the Janjaweed more than two decades ago. Where previously, they used camels, horses, and basic weapons. The militia now has armored vehicles, drones, and advanced weaponry, along with significant support from regional powers and nations such as the United Arab Emirates, Ali said. A June 12 report by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab said that a cargo plane believed to be owned by the UAE was identified through satellite imagery flying within RSF-controlled areas in El-Fasher on June 11. \u201cThe same model of aircraft (IL-76) is reported to be used for lethal aid transfers by the UAE to the RSF for flights to locations in Chad,\u201d the report added. The UAE has denied providing military, financial, or logistical support to any armed group in Sudan. What happens if El Fasher falls? US Special Envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, said this week that El Fasher\u2019s fall to the RSF could be imminent. Home to nearly 2 million people, the city is predominantly occupied by non-Arab\u00a0ethnic groups, including the Masalit. El Fasher also shelters hundreds of thousands of displaced people who fled other parts of Darfur that were captured by the RSF, including El Geneina where hundreds of non-Arab people were massacred last year. Ali told CNN similar atrocities were likely to happen in El Fasher if the city came under RSF control. \u201cEl Fasher is going to be a lot more catastrophic because it is basically in the middle of a desert. Even if people decide to leave, probably they will die\u00a0in the desert. We will see another genocide on our watch.\u201d What has been the international response? The UN Security Council adopted a UK-led\u00a0resolution Thursday demanding that the RSF ends its \u201csiege\u201d of El Fasher. \u201cThe fighting must stop now,\u201d said UK Foreign Secretary\u00a0David Cameron in a post on X, adding that warring \u201cparties must let in urgent humanitarian aid to prevent a famine.\u201d Earlier this week, the International Criminal Court said it was investigating allegations of war crimes in El Fasher while making a public call for evidence. International response to the conflict has however been criticized as insufficient. Despite calls for action, including the deployment of protective missions and the imposition of sanctions by the United States on key RSF commanders, concrete measures have been limited. \u201cThe international response does not come close to meeting the scale of the world\u2019s largest man-made humanitarian disaster,\u201d said\u00a0international human rights lawyer, Yonah Diamond. \u201cThe major powers have largely invested in a sham peace process for 14 months that is going nowhere and serves as a cover for daily mass atrocities on the ground. Only concrete acts of protection and accountability will stem the violence,\u201d he told CNN. International efforts to broker ceasefires between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF have been unsuccessful. Diamond said there has also been insufficient coverage of the Sudan war when compared to other global conflicts. \u201cEvery major news outlet has dedicated an ongoing slot to Gaza and Ukraine, with ad hoc coverage for Sudan. There is no reason why a conflict impacting a greater number of civilians, threatening millions with death by starvation and an ongoing genocide do not receive the same attention,\u201d he said. He noted that this lack of attention hinders humanitarian efforts, pointing out that while Gaza and Ukraine have each received about 30% of their humanitarian response plans, Sudan, where 25 million people urgently need help, has received only about half of that amount. What will happen next? As Sudan steers dangerously towards another genocide, the world\u2019s response in the coming months will be crucial in determining the outcome. \u201cThe international community, led by the African Union, must deploy a civilian protection mechanism to protect the millions at risk in El Fasher and elsewhere in Sudan and explicitly threaten the UAE with consequences should it fail to restrain the RSF and continue to supply the militias with heavy weaponry,\u201d Diamond advised. \u201cThe US, the UK, and others have leverage to exert pressure on their ally, the UAE, to end the RSF\u2019s genocidal campaign today. President (Joe) Biden can simply call on the UAE to halt its support for the RSF, which would fall apart without it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/africa/sudan-darfur-genocide-fears-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_africa_south-africa-governing-alliance-emerges-intl", "text": "The African National Congress and its staunchest adversary, the White-led, Democratic Alliance, forged an unprecedented alliance Friday, agreeing to collaborate in South Africa\u2019s new government of national unity, a stunning turn of events that ends 30 years of ANC political dominance. \u201cAfter two weeks of thorough negotiations that only concluded after today\u2019s sitting of Parliament had already started, the DA has reached agreement on the statement of intent for the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU),\u201d the DA\u2019s leader John Steenhuisen said in a statement in Cape Town on Friday. The respective parties involved include the ANC, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the DA, Steenhuisen outlined in his statement. \u201cToday, the 14th of June 2024 will go down in the annals of history as the start of a new chapter for our beloved country,\u201d Steenhuisen said. The DA, a broadly centrist and pro-business party, is seen as the official opposition to the ANC, and has been heavily critical of the ANC for years. \u201cIt is difficult to overstate just how significant this moment is for the Democratic Alliance,\u201d Steenhuisen said, adding that the party will \u201cgovern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration.\u201d \u201cThanks to the 3.5 million people who voted for us, the DA will no longer only be an opposition party at a national level. Instead, the DA now becomes the second biggest party inside a multi-party national government,\u201d the DA leader added. No party managed to win an outright majority in South Africa\u2019s election last month. Support for the ANC dropped to 40.18%,\u00a0a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election in 2019. The DA party received 21.8% of the vote. Former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s newly-formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) had nearly 14.59% of the vote. Another ANC splinter party \u2013 the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 had nearly 10%, with results at 9.52% The ANC\u2019s Secretary General Fikile Mbalula said on Thursday the party had reached a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d with political parties in coalition negotiations during a press conference on Thursday in Cape Town. The announcement comes as the newly elected parliament was convening for the first time and lawmakers were in the process of being sworn in. \u201cToday marks the beginning of a new era where we put our differences aside and unite for the betterment of all South Africans,\u201d wrote Sihle Zikalala, of the ANC\u2019s governing body, in a post on X. Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC leader, will remain the country\u2019s president under the deal, according to a report on the TimesLive news website. South Africa\u2019s rand currency was trading up about 0.3% against the dollar, helped by reports by the SABC and other local media of a deal including the ANC and DA, which has been the preferred option in the eyes of markets and investors, according to Reuters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/africa/south-africa-governing-alliance-emerges-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

The award \u2013 created in 2018 by Forestry England, the UK\u2019s Royal Geographic Society and visual arts consultancy Parker Harris \u2013 aims to showcase the beauty of our planet, as well as the threats it is facing, from climate change to toxic pollution. More than 1,900 images and videos were submitted to this year\u2019s competition by photographers and filmmakers from all over the world. The winners were announced last night at a ceremony at London\u2019s Royal Geographical Society, ahead of an exhibition at the same location showcasing the evocative imagery. Photographers Jean-Marc Caimi and Valentina Piccinni took the top prize with their \u201cTropicalia\u201d series, which documents how Sicilian farmers are adapting in response to climate change. \u201cRising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, and an increased risk of extreme events have transformed what was once Europe\u2019s breadbasket into a testing ground for adaptation and survival,\u201d they said in a press release. Their images show how farmers are having to diversify: some are giving up their fields to solar energy systems, while others are pivoting to grow exotic fruits such as avocadoes and mangoes that thrive in the now tropical environment. \u201cEach inspiring image highlights the important stories of resistance, innovation and resilience at the frontline of climate change,\u201d Louise Fedotov-Clements, head of Earth Photo\u2019s jury and director of Photoworks UK, told CNN. \u201cThe series as a whole serves as an example of the future that awaits the whole continent.\u201d Other winning imagery depicts possible climate solutions, including Jennifer Adler\u2019s \u201cCorals of the Future\u201d series that focuses on ocean science and the efforts to restore marine ecosystems in the world\u2019s largest underwater coral nursery. A short film, \u201cSer Guardianes Madre Arbol\u201d (\u201cBecoming Guardians of Mother Tree\u201d), by Marc Lathuilli\u00e8re, celebrates an indigenous community in northern Colombia that is fighting for the protection of rainforest and their ancestral lands. The works highlight \u201cthe beauty, fragility, crisis and change happening in our natural environment,\u201d said Mike Seddon, chief executive of Forestry England, in a press release. \u201cBringing us closer to landscapes, wildlife and communities from across the planet in this way sparks new conversations and reflections. And it prompts us to focus on the creative solutions needed for these environments to flourish beyond our lifetimes.\u201d Fedotov-Clements added that photography and film \u201crepresent a formidable means for raising awareness that can encourage us to adapt, innovate and invent sustainable solutions.\u201d \u201cFrom the impact of climate change to the inspiring stories of resilience, this year\u2019s powerful edition is sure to inspire stimulating dialogues about our environment,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/earth-photo-2024-c2e-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
