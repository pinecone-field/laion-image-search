{"id": "travel_knoxville-tennessee-best-towns-america", "text": "Knoxville residents have a slogan for their city: Keep Knoxville scruffy. It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek response to a slight from a Wall Street Journal reporter writing about Knoxville\u2019s ultimately successful bid to host the 1982 World\u2019s Fair. When he referred to this locale as \u201ca scruffy little city,\u201d residents decided to wear the insult as a badge of honor \u2013 and still do. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be fancy and polished,\u201d goes the thinking. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our patina. It\u2019s so much more interesting.\u201d Not to mention friendly. \u201cI came here for college in 1987 and never left,\u201d says Tanya Kanczuzewski, a locally based marketing director. \u201cThis is a strong community town. Anywhere you go, people are happy to stop and have a conversation, point you in the right direction, or give you tidbits of advice. Other than the traffic on I-40, it doesn\u2019t feel overwhelming here like bigger cities.\u201d Knoxville\u2019s tallest building is 27 stories, yet it has a distinctive skyline thanks to the Sunsphere, a golden glass ball 75 feet in diameter sitting atop a 198-foot steel tower that was built for the aforementioned World\u2019s Fair. The glass contains 24-karat gold dust, making the sphere glow when the sun hits it. The observation deck inside provides a 365-degree view, including the Great Smoky Mountains to the south. A welcome center is currently under construction on the level below the observation deck. Another huge ball of note is the 30-foot tall, 10-ton basketball (the world\u2019s largest) outside the Women\u2019s Basketball Hall of Fame. This is the only facility of its kind devoted to all levels of women\u2019s basketball, and it\u2019s here for good reason. Knoxville is home to the wildly popular University of Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team and was also home to legendary coach Pat Summitt, whose 1,098 career wins were the most in Division I college basketball history \u2013 for men\u2019s or women\u2019s teams \u2013 at her retirement in 2012. The city also goes crazy for the university\u2019s football team, which plays in the perpetually sold-out 102,000-seat Neyland Stadium. On fall game days, everything is awash in orange and white, the university\u2019s colors. (Knoxville has no pro sports teams, but the AA baseball team \u2014 the Knoxville Smokies, a minor league affiliate of the Chicago Cubs \u2014 will get a boost when they open their 2025 season in a new, multipurpose stadium on the edge of downtown). The university is central to the city\u2019s history. James White, the founder of Knoxville, set up a fort and some cabins in 1786 in the Great Valley at the headwaters of the Tennessee River, on lands that were hunting grounds of the Cherokee Indians. The settlement was known as Knoxville by 1791, and by 1794, the town was home to Blount College. Today, it\u2019s known as the University of Tennessee. \u2018Best sound\u2019 around Market Square, Knoxville\u2019s most popular gathering place, is a pedestrian plaza in the heart of downtown that offers eclectic boutiques, restaurants and rooftop bars. There\u2019s a farmer\u2019s market here from late spring to early fall, free concerts (including jazz performed by the Knoxville Jazz Orchestra) in summer and an ice-skating rink in winter. The Gay Street historic district just a block away is also a hot spot. This 10-block stretch includes art galleries, shops, bars, hotels and restaurants housed in buildings that date as far back as the late 1800s. A popular First Friday art walk is held here monthly, with galleries and other businesses offering free drinks and snacks. \u201cFirst Friday is a blast,\u201d says Colby McLemore, a professional photographer who has a studio downtown. \u201cI love the diversity of the art and the relaxed and inviting vibe. It\u2019s one of my favorite things about Knoxville.\u201d Gay Street is also home to three historic theaters, all gems. You can\u2019t miss the Tennessee Theatre, with its six-story vertical sign that lights up at night. This grande dame was built in 1928 and underwent a $25 million renovation in 2005. Its original decor includes crystal chandeliers and Italian terrazzo flooring. While it\u2019s home to the city\u2019s symphony orchestra and opera company, you can also see other musical and theatrical performances and even vintage films here. The Bijou Theatre sits two blocks down Gay Street. Its opening show in 1909 starred George M. Cohan. Performances today include all manner of concerts in a fairly intimate 700-seat theater known for its stellar acoustics. \u201cIt has the best sound of any venue I\u2019ve ever been in, including those in Nashville and Atlanta,\u201d says Jody Collins, host of the podcast \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man,\u201d who often interviews entertainers, such as local and touring musicians who come through town. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a bad seat in the house.\u201d The Regal Riviera Theatre, a modern movie theater with an old-fashioned-looking facade, occupies the same site as\u00a0an Art Deco movie house\u00a0also called the Riviera Theater that was\u00a0built in 1920\u00a0but torn down in 1988. It\u2019s\u00a0one block in the opposite direction from the Tennessee Theatre. Tucked into the northeast corner of downtown is Old City, more or less the Greenwich Village of Knoxville. This offbeat urban neighborhood has the city\u2019s most concentrated collection of restored Victorian buildings and is filled with funky coffee shops, diverse dining spots, art galleries, beer joints and spiffy cocktail bars (including Brother Wolf, which enjoys a national reputation). \u2018Best soft-serve in the Southeast\u2019 You may not expect to find world-class dining in a small Southern city, but it\u2019s here. Joseph Lenn, owner of J.C. Holdway, was the first chef in the state to win a James Beard Award. He cooks his inventive fare in a wood-fire oven. \u201cI think some restaurants here hold up against a Pete Wells New York Times review,\u201d notes native New Yorker and longtime Knoxville resident Steven Friedlander, an editor and writer. He names Osteria Stella (Italian) and Kefi (Greek), both in Old City, and Vida (pan-Latin) on Gay Street as his favorite examples. \u201cThen skip dessert at the fancy restaurants and go to Cruze Farm on Gay Street for ice cream,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a local dairy that sells some of the best soft-serve in the Southeast.\u201d The craft beer craze is alive and well here. The Knoxville Area Brewers Association promotes an Ale Trail highlighting 27 breweries. Clusters of them exist in the Central Street/Broadway area north of downtown and on Sevier Avenue, just over the bridge from downtown in South Knoxville (christened SoKno by the neighborhood\u2019s young adult population). More are sprinkled about town and in the suburbs. \u201cX\u00fcl Beer Company in the Old City is my personal favorite,\u201d Kanczuzewski says, \u201cbut my secret pleasure is Abridged, a brewpub in a converted mechanic\u2019s garage in Bearden,\u201d a suburb close to downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s my go-to place for the best burger in town.\u201d Before they\u2019re famous It\u2019s already known as the \u201cCradle of Country Music\u201d thanks to its role in developing the careers of stars like Dolly Parton, Chet Atkins and Roy Acuff, but Knoxville is fast gaining a more modern reputation as a great place for live music. This is due in large part to the growing popularity of a music festival founded in 2009 known as Big Ears\u2014music industry slang for an especially acute and perceptive listener, according to festival founder Ashley Capps. Big Ears, named \u201cmusic festival of the year\u201d by Spin in 2023, is undeniably Knoxville\u2019s biggest music coup. People come from all over the United States and even overseas to attend. (Last year, 70% of the 30,500 attendees were out-of-towners.) The festival offers diverse genres in multiple downtown venues, from big theaters to hole-in-the-wall bars. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma has shown up, as has Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. This year, multiple-Grammy winner Andre 3000 (half of the hip hop duo Outkast) gave a flute concert at St. John\u2019s Cathedral. \u201cWe are not the next big thing, we are our own thing,\u201d explains Collins about Knoxville\u2019s music scene in general. In addition to attracting major acts, Collins notes, \u201cThis is also a great place to see underground bands before they break.\u201d He saw Green Day in 1992 (pre \u201cDookie\u201d) at a local pub, and he saw Lake Street Dive (before the band was big) with only seven other people in the audience. He also saw heavy metal band System of a Down before they racked up so many Grammys. \u201cMy dad and his uncles saw Alabama when they were a bar band on The Strip,\u201d he adds, using a locals\u2019 term for Cumberland Avenue, a street that runs from downtown through the adjacent campus of the University of Tennessee. Of the handful of bars he frequents for live music, the Pilot Light in Old City is his favorite. \u201cThe capacity is only 75,\u201d he says, \u201cso you can often experience something that may never be replicated.\u201d Another intimate music experience is the Blue Plate Special, a free live concert presented at noon at the visitor\u2019s center on Gay Street and broadcast on WDVX. (Concert-goers are even invited to bring their lunch.) All types of local and internationally famous artists appear here. \u201cAmy Ray of the Indigo Girls will be passing through town and play at the Blue Plate Special,\u201d Collins notes. 10 minutes from a trailhead While the city is about an hour from Great Smoky Mountains National Park (the most visited US national park and home to beautiful luminous evening displays by fireflies), you don\u2019t have to go that far to commune with nature. Knoxville\u2019s 1,500-acre Urban Wilderness includes five city parks, four Civil War sites, wildlife areas, a nature preserve, several waterways and more. Its 60-plus miles (100 kilometers) of hiking and mountain biking trails and greenways connect downtown with the surrounding area. \u201cIn 10 minutes from downtown, you can be at a trailhead,\u201d says Jeff Shmerler, a retired tech industry engineer who is active in the local mountain biking club. No need to bring your own equipment \u2013 some hotels rent or lend bikes to guests, and numerous rental shops can set you up with bikes and watercraft. \u201cYou can go canoeing, hiking and biking all in the same day,\u201d Shmerler notes. The nonprofit Ijams Nature Center is a core part of the Urban Wilderness, with more than 300 acres of forests, meadows, wetlands and creeks. It\u2019s also home to an independently operated adventure park with zip lines, swinging bridges, balance challenges and more. Shmerler sums it up well: \u201cThis is a cool place to be.\u201d Next town: Duluth, Minnesota is No. 10 How outdoor activities and a creative spirit make it cooler by the lake.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/knoxville-tennessee-best-towns-america/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_style_vivien-maier-street-photography-new-york", "text": "For much of her life, Vivian Maier was something of a mystery. Her photographic talent went largely unrecognized because she kept her work a secret from most of the people who knew her, including the New York and Chicago families she worked for as a live-in nanny and caregiver. Maier only printed a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of images of bustling city life she snapped with her Rolleiflex and Leica cameras over some five decades, and showed them to almost no one, instead amassing boxes and boxes of negatives and unprocessed film. Her fame came about posthumously, and only because the contents of her Chicago storge lockers were sold off at auction in 2007, after she had stopped paying the rent. \u201cVivian Maier the mystery, the discovery, and the work \u2014 those three parts together are difficult to separate,\u201d said Anne Morin, curator of the touring exhibition \u201cVivian Maier: Unseen Work,\u201d which opened 31 May at Fotografiska New York, the American outpost of the Swedish contemporary photography museum. The show, which runs through 29 September, does not attempt to unravel the puzzle of Maier\u2019s life, however, instead focusing on the work itself, with more than 200 photographs on display, including about 50 vintage prints made by Maier. Morin places her work on the same level as that of renowned street photographers like Robert Frank and Diane Arbus, and worthy of a place in the history of photography. \u201cNobody doubts that,\u201d Morin told CNN. \u201cThe work is strong and Maier had a marvelous eye. And in 10 years, we could do another completely different show \u2014 she has more than enough material to bring to the table.\u201d The exhibition is also a homecoming of sorts for Maier, who was born in New York to a family of French and German immigrants. She started capturing street scenes in the city as a young woman in the 1950s, first borrowing her mother\u2019s Kodak Brownie box camera and then buying her own professional-grade Rollieflex, which she taught herself to use. Her confidence and skill in finding the right moment to snap the shutter is evident even in these early works, in which Maier zeroed in on the unique characters and situations that make up city life: Men snoring open-mouthed on park benches; a balloon from the Central Park Zoo floating to hide a doting father\u2019s face as his baby reaches towards him. But while Maier was known to use commercial studios in New York to have her film processed, she never seems to have made a serious effort to exhibit or sell her work. Maier\u2019s return to New York as a popular icon is \u201ca big thing not only for women, but also for all the artists who are working and are never recognized and never have the opportunity to be seen, to be shared, to exist,\u201d Morin said. \u201cIt is never late to repair history.\u201d New York is \u201cin many ways, the heart of photography history in America,\u201d said Sophie Wright, the museum\u2019s director. \u201cSo it\u2019s amazing now to be in a position to be bringing Vivian back to that world. She\u2019s a rediscovered, important voice of 20th-century photography.\u201d Wright added that Maier\u2019s photographs were taken with \u201cso much thought and care and lack of self-consciousness \u2014 there\u2019s no audience in mind. In a way, it\u2019s pure, artistic expression for her.\u201d Maier\u2019s name and work first captured the public imagination in 2009, the same year she died in Chicago, after the collector and amateur historian John Maloof shared scans of her work on the photo-sharing website Flickr. He was seeking advice on what to do with the thousands of negatives, prints and undeveloped rolls of film he had acquired over the past two years, after stumbling across Maier\u2019s work at the auctions of her storage lockers. Photographers and critics immediately remarked on Maier\u2019s well balanced compositions, and her incisive and often humorous view of the people and places she came across, not just in New York, but also Chicago, where she moved in 1956 and spent most of her adult life, as well as the far flung locations she visited on vacations, from California to Europe and Asia. In 2011, Maloof published a book, \u201cVivian Maier: Street Photographer,\u201d and with the filmmaker Charlie Siskel co-directed the 2013 documentary \u201cFinding Vivian Maier,\u201d which was nominated for an Academy Award. A number of other gallery shows and biographies have also debuted in the years since\u2014 as well as a legal tussle over Maier\u2019s estate, which is now overseen by Chicago\u2019s Cook County Probate Court, and with which Maloof has signed an agreement to display and sell her work. (While Maier did not have any children of her own to inherit her estate, 10 potential heirs in Europe have been found among her extended family, and the court is looking into whether her brother Carl, who died in a psychiatric hospital in 1977, might have had any children.) The public\u2019s appetite for Maier hasn\u2019t diminished, however. When the current exhibition was on display at the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris in 2021, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 213,000 people attended over its four-month run. The opening preview in New York on 30 May had over 600 visitors. Despite her immense popularity, some museums have been slow to accept her work, even those that have major photography collections. Wright attributes this caution over Maier\u2019s work to the fact that she did not make many prints herself. \u201cThere\u2019s a reticence to be seen to be driving a narrative for the work that\u2019s not the artist\u2019s,\u201d\u00a0she explained, as well as a nervousness around the politics of her situation as a woman who was vulnerable in her later years. (At the end of her life, as her hoarding led to her losing caretaking jobs, Maier was believed to have been facing homelessness, until two of her former charges, Lane and Matthew Gensburg, paid for an apartment for her to live in, and later a nursing home.) Maloof and the photography dealer Howard Greenberg, who represents his extensive collection, acknowledge the concerns around posthumous printing of Maier\u2019s work, and during a talk at the exhibition opening, said that led to their decision to only create uncropped, direct reproductions from her negatives. In the show, there are many instances where these later prints are displayed next to the ones Maier made herself, showing how she chose to focus on certain elements in a scene. Maier\u2019s presence can also be felt in the exhibition through audio recordings she made\u00a0 interviewing the children she cared for to encourage their critical thinking, which were also found in her storage lockers. They are played throughout the galleries. But the most persistent reminders of the artist behind these works are the numerous self-portraits she took, often as reflections in mirrored and glass surfaces, or simply as her shadow cast on the ground or a wall. \u201cThe beating heart of the work is the self-representation,\u201d Morin said, and it is these works she sees resonating the most with today\u2019s audiences. \u201cEverybody says, \u2018Oh, my God, Vivian was the godmother of the selfie.\u2019 But it\u2019s different,\u201d the curator continued. Maier\u2019s self-portraits are a stubborn insistence in declaring her independence and identity, at a time when women, and especially domestic workers like her, were ignored and marginalized. \u201cShe wanted to record that,\u201d Morin said, imagining Maier as saying: \u201cI\u2019m here at this moment. No one will erase my face. I exist and I have the proof.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/style/vivien-maier-street-photography-new-york/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_china_china-rocket-debris-falls-over-village-intl-hnk", "text": "Suspected debris from a Chinese rocket was seen plummeting to the ground over a village in southwest China on Saturday, leaving a trail of bright yellow smoke and sending villagers running, according to videos on Chinese social media and sent to CNN by a local witness. The dramatic footage surfaced online shortly after a Long March 2C carrier rocket blasted off at 3p.m. local time Saturday (3 a.m. Eastern Time) from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the southwestern province of Sichuan. The rocket sent into orbit the Space Variable Objects Monitor, a powerful satellite developed by China and France to study the farthest explosion of stars known as gamma-ray bursts. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to establish the country as a dominant space power, ramping up missions to compete with other major world powers, including the United States. Saturday\u2019s launch was declared a \u201ccomplete success\u201d by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), a state-owned contractor that developed the Long March 2C rocket. CNN has reached out to the CASC and the State Council Information Office, which handles press inquiries for the Chinese government, including its space agency, for comment. A video posted on Kuaishou, a Chinese short-video site, appeared to show a long, cylindrical shaped piece of debris falling over a rural village and crashed next to a hill, with yellow smoke billowing from one end. CNN geolocated the video to be filmed from Xianqiao village in Guizhou province, neighboring the launch site province of Sichuan to the southeast.\u00a0The video was posted on Kuaishou from an IP address in Guizhou. Other videos circulating on Chinese social media platforms analyzed by CNN showed multiple angles of the falling debris. In one of them, villagers, including children, were seen running away while looking back at the orange trail in the sky, with some covering their ears for the crash. Some videos had been taken down by Monday afternoon. Witnesses on social media said they heard a loud explosion after the debris crashed into the ground. An\u00a0eyewitness told CNN they saw the rocket fall with their \u201cown eyes.\u201d \u201cThere was a pungent smell and the sound of an explosion,\u201d they added. In a now-deleted government notice reposted by a local villager shortly after the launch, authorities said that Xinba Town, near Xianqiao village,\u00a0was going to carry out a \u201crocket debris recovery mission\u201d from 2:45 p.m. to 3:15 p.m.\u00a0local time on Saturday. Residents were asked to leave their homes and other buildings an hour before the launch and scatter out in more open areas to observe the sky. They were warned to keep away from the debris to prevent harm from \u201ctoxic gas and explosion,\u201d according to the notice. Residents were also \u201cstrictly forbidden\u201d to take photos of the debris or \u201cspread relevant videos online,\u201d the notice said. There were no reports of immediate injuries from local authorities. \u2018Extremely toxic\u2019 Markus Schiller, a rocket expert and associate senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the debris appeared to be the first-stage booster of the Long March 2C rocket, which uses a liquid propellant consisting of nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). \u201cThis combination always creates these orange smoke trails. It\u2019s extremely toxic and carcinogenic,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cEvery living being that inhales that stuff will have a hard time in the near future,\u201d he added. Such incidents happen frequently in China due to the location of its launch site, he said. \u201cIf you want to launch something to low Earth orbit, you usually launch it in the easternly direction to get some extra boost from the rotation of the Earth. But if you launch to the east, there are definitely always some villages in the pathway of the boosters of the first stage.\u201d Most rockets in China are blasted from the country\u2019s three inland launch sites \u2013 Xichang in the southwest, Jiuquan in the Gobi Desert in the northwest, and Taiyuan in the north. Built during the Cold War, these bases were deliberately located far from the coast\u00a0out of security concerns. In 2016, a fourth launch site, Wenchang, opened in Hainan Island, the country\u2019s southernmost province. In comparison, NASA and the European Space Agency usually launch their rockets from coastal locations toward the ocean, said Schiller, who\u2019s also a director of ST Analytics in Munich, Germany. Western space agencies have also largely phased out the kind of highly toxic liquid propellants for their civilian space programs, which China \u2013 and Russia \u2013 still use, he added. Multi-staged rockets shed debris shortly after blast-off, along trajectories that can be predicted before the launch. Before each launch, China\u2019s civil aviation authority typically issues a notice to pilots, known as NOTAM, to warn them against the \u201ctemporary danger areas\u201d where rocket debris are likely to be falling. Debris from Chinese rockets have hit villages before. In December 2023, the debris of a rocket landed in southern Hunan Province, damaging two houses, state media reported.\u00a0In 2002, a boy in northern China was injured when fragments from a satellite launch fell on his village in Shaanxi province. \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see something like that for quite a while, for many years to come,\u201d Schiller said. China has previously faced criticism from the international space community for its handling of debris from its out-of-control rocket boosters when they reenter Earth. In 2021, NASA lambasted China for its failure to \u201cmeet responsible standards\u201d after debris from its out-of-control Long March 5B rocket plunged into the Indian Ocean just west of the Maldives after reentering the atmosphere.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/china/china-rocket-debris-falls-over-village-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_asia_bangladesh-flooding-sylhet-climate-intl-hnk", "text": "Extensive flooding has stranded about 1.8 million people in northeast Bangladesh, following weeks of heavy rains that have submerged homes and devastated farmland, according to state media and humanitarian agencies. Video shows large swathes of Sylhet city\u00a0and the nearby town of Sunamganj underwater in the second wave of flooding to hit the region in less than a month, state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) reported Saturday. The widespread flooding was triggered by prolonged\u00a0torrential rain and water runoff from the hilly regions upstream on the border with India, which caused four rivers to swell beyond their danger marks, the Water Development Board said last week, according to local media. Villagers in the hardest-hit low-lying areas of Sylhet could be seen wading through chest-deep water and heaping their belongings into piles to protect them from the muddy waters. There is concern for those trapped by floodwaters who now face food shortages and\u00a0a lack of clean water, according to local media. About 964,000 people in Sylhet and 792,000 in Sunamganj had been affected by the flooding and authorities said they had set up more than 6,000 shelters to help the displaced, BSS reported. Among them are 772,000 children who were in urgent need of assistance, the United Nations\u2019 Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said\u00a0Friday. More than 800 schools had been flooded with 500 more used as flood shelters, the agency said. \u201cAs waters rise, children are the most vulnerable, facing heightened risks of drowning, malnutrition, deadly waterborne diseases, the trauma of displacement, and potential abuse in overpopulated shelters,\u201d Sheldon Yett, UNICEF Representative to Bangladesh, said in a statement. International development organization BRAC said it was helping to deliver emergency food and health support to hundreds of families in Sylhet and Sunamganj. It said about 2.25 million people have been affected by the flash floods, which have left 12,000 people in the region without power. Khondoker Golam Tawhid, program head of BRAC\u2019s Disaster Risk Management Program said flooding in the country is \u201cbecoming more dangerous\u201d with \u201chuge losses to livelihoods, biodiversity and infrastructure \u2014 and interruption to schooling and health services.\u201d \u201cBangladesh is used to flooding, but climate change is making floods more intense and less predictable, making it impossible for families to stay safe, let alone plan ahead,\u201d Tawhid said. Meanwhile, fish farmers have faced significant losses as floodwaters wash away thousands of farms and ponds, with local media reporting an economic toll of over $11.4 million. Densely populated and low-lying Bangladesh is prone to seasonal rains, flooding and cyclones. But the South Asian country is one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable to the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis,\u00a0studies show. As extreme weather events become more frequent and severe as a result of the climate crisis, the humanitarian and economic impacts to Bangladesh will continue to deteriorate. By 2050, 13 million people in Bangladesh could become climate migrants and severe flooding could cause GDP to fall by as much as 9%, according to the World Bank. The latest bout of heavy rains and floods came as the region had barely recovered from widespread flooding in late May following Tropical Cyclone Remal, which lashed Bangladesh and southern India and impacted about 5 million people. \u201cFor many, this will change the course of their lives, leaving them without homes and schools and forcing them to move to temporary shelters for who knows how long,\u201d said Sultana Begum, Save the Children\u2019s regional humanitarian advocacy and policy manager for Asia, in a statement. \u201cEverything we are hearing points towards these kinds of extreme weather events getting worse and worse. And we have certainly not seen two bouts of severe flooding happen in such quick succession before. Make no mistake, the climate emergency is already making its mark on India and Bangladesh, and it is robbing children of their homes, families, food, water, and access to education and healthcare.\u201d Rohingya vulnerable Monsoon rains and landslides have also affected southern Bangladesh, where about a million people from the Rohingya Muslim community are living in the world\u2019s biggest refugee camps, having fled persecution and violence in neighboring Myanmar. At least 10 people, including three children, died from mudslides and heavy rainfall in the refugee camps near Cox\u2019s Bazar on Wednesday, according to Bangladesh\u2019s Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. \u201cPeople have been evacuated from the low-lying areas and at least 500 people have been shifted to other relief centers,\u201d Hasan Sarwar, head of the refugee cell for the ministry told CNN last week. Many Rohingya refugees live in bamboo and tarpaulin shelters perched on hilly slopes that are vulnerable to strong winds, rain, and landslides. Save the Children said about 8,000 people in 33 camps have been impacted by the torrential downpours, which have destroyed or damaged more than 1,000 shelters. The humanitarian group noted that the monsoon season in Bangladesh has only just started and will last for the next two months, with the potential to bring more heavy rains, landslides and flooding. Landslides, heavy rains and flooding have also hit the neighboring Indian state of Assam, affecting more than 4 million people, according to Save the Children. At least 31 people have died in the floods and landslides since May 29 in the state, according to local police and disaster management authorities. Some immediate relief for northeast Bangladesh is in sight, however, as the rains\u00a0began to ease and there are signs that floodwaters were starting to recede, local media reported. The Bangladesh Water Development Board said Saturday that water levels of the major rivers in the northeast were falling and the trend could continue over the coming days if further rains hold off. \u201cOverall improvement of the flood situation in various low-lying areas under districts of the northeastern part of the country may continue in next 72 hours,\u201d it said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/asia/bangladesh-flooding-sylhet-climate-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_asia_philippines-footage-south-china-sea-clash-china-intl-hnk", "text": "The Philippines has accused China\u2019s Coast Guard of launching a \u201cbrutal assault\u201d with bladed weapons during a South China Sea clash earlier this week, a major escalation in a festering dispute that threatens to drag the United States into another global conflict. Footage released by the Philippine military on Thursday showed Chinese coast guard officers brandishing an axe and other bladed or pointed tools at the Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boat, in what Manila called \u201ca brazen act of aggression.\u201d The Philippines and China have blamed each other for the confrontation near the Second Thomas Shoal in the contested\u00a0Spratly Islands on Monday, which took place during a Philippine mission to resupply its soldiers stationed on a beached World War II-era warship that asserts Manila\u2019s territorial claims over the atoll. The incident is the latest in a series of increasingly fraught confrontations\u00a0in the resource-rich and strategically important waterway. But the scenes captured in the latest footage mark an inflection point in the long-simmering tensions, with China adopting new, far more openly aggressive tactics that, analysts say, appear calculated to test how the Philippines and its key defense ally \u2013 the United States \u2013 will respond. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore,\u00a0said it was unprecedented for China\u2019s maritime law enforcement to board a Philippine naval vessel. \u201cThey can be rubber boats, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are Philippine Navy vessels, and according to international law, they enjoy what we term as sovereign immunity,\u201d Koh said. \u201cThat is very dangerous, because, if anything, that could even be construed as an act of war.\u201d Boats \u2018looted\u2019 At a news conference on Wednesday, senior Philippine military officials said China\u2019s Coast Guard officers \u201cillegally boarded\u201d the Philippine rubber boats, \u201clooted\u201d seven disassembled rifles stored in gun cases, \u201cdestroyed\u201d outboard motor, communication and navigation equipment and took the personal cellphones of Filipino personnel. \u201cThey deliberately punctured our rubber boats using knives and other pointed tools,\u201d said Alfonso Torres Jr., commander of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Western Command. A Philippine Navy serviceman on the rubber boat lost his right thumb when the Chinese Coast Guard rammed it, Torres said. China\u2019s Coast Guard also deployed tear gas, \u201cblinding\u201d strobe lights and continuously blared sirens, the AFP said. \u201cOnly pirates do this. Only pirates board, steal, and destroy ships, equipment, and belongings,\u201d Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said in a statement. \u201cThe Chinese Coast Guard personnel had bladed weapons and our personnel fought with bare hands. That is what\u2019s important. We were outnumbered and their weapons were unexpected but our personnel fought with everything that they had,\u201d Brawner added. At a regular briefing with reporters on Thursday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry was asked to comment on the allegations from the Philippines that their vessels were damaged by Chinese coast guard personnel wielding blades and firing tear gas. Spokesman Lin Jian did not address those allegations, and instead reasserted Beijing\u2019s claims over the Second Thomas Shoal, known as Ren\u2019ai Jiao in China. \u201cThe Philippine operation was not for humanitarian supplies at all. The Philippine vessels carried not only construction materials but also smuggled weapons. They also intentionally rammed into Chinese vessels and splashed water and threw things on Chinese law-enforcement personnel,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThese actions have obviously aggravated tensions at sea and seriously threatened the safety of Chinese personnel and ships.\u201d Mutual defense treaty What happens in the South China Sea has profound implications for the US, which has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines that dates back decades. The latest clash marks the first run-in between the two countries since a new law in China took effect Saturday to authorize its coast guard to seize foreign ships and detain crews suspected of trespassing for up to 60 days without trial. It also comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr.\u00a0warned\u00a0that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the waterway would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which\u00a0has repeatedly stressed Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller\u00a0said\u00a0Monday the \u201cUnited States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions\u201d by China. In a phone call with his Philippine counterpart Enrique A. Manalo on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China\u2019s actions, \u201cundermine regional peace and stability and underscored the United States\u2019 ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.\u201d Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, a US-based think tank, said the footage released by the Philippines \u201cclearly shows a Chinese attack on Philippine military assets,\u201d which according to Washington and Manila\u2019s defense pact\u00a0would trigger mutual defense commitments. \u201cHowever, in practical terms, the Philippines itself would have to initiate a move to activate (it) before the US would intervene militarily,\u201d he said. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines\u2019 claims in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to assert historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen\u00a0Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. Philippine \u2018restraint\u2019 The decision by China\u2019s Coast Guard to use bladed weapons in the latest South China Sea clash has drawn comparisons with clashes between China and India on their disputed Himalayan border, where soldiers on both sides have fought fiercely with sticks, rocks and their hands. The Philippine personnel on the rubber boats are elite forces hailing from the Navy Special Operations Group, Koh said. \u201cThey are trained in combat. They did not retaliate against the Chinese because they\u2019re just simply exercising restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cThey probably have received instructions right from the top that under whatever circumstance they are not supposed to fight back against the Chinese and escalate the situation.\u201d The footage released by the Philippine military also showed another striking development \u2013 that the clash took place right next to the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert Manila\u2019s territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal. This is the closest China\u2019s Coast Guard has come to the BRP Sierra Madre, Koh noted. \u201cUnder normal rules of engagement, the garrison would have fired warning shots,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that this incident didn\u2019t escalate further is because the Philippines exercised utmost restraint. That\u2019s a simple fact.\u201d China, Koh said, was trying to test both Manila and Washington \u201cto find out exactly where the red line is.\u201d \u201cThey wanted to see how far the US is willing to pledge its security commitment to the Filipinos. And of course, I don\u2019t think Beijing is dumb enough not to have considered the possibility of having all these actions escalate the situation, but I believe that was a risk that they, in the end, decided to take.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/asia/philippines-footage-south-china-sea-clash-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_sport_lakers-coach-jj-redick-first-news-conference", "text": "Former longtime NBA shooting guard JJ Redick, who has no prior coaching experience in the league, was introduced Monday as the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 next coach. Redick, who celebrated his 40th birthday Monday, replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired in May after two seasons with the Lakers. \u201cI have zero coaching experience in the NBA, but I would argue that I\u2019m very experienced and it started 22 years ago when I went to Duke and I got to play for Coach K (Mike Krzyzewski) for four years, spent 15 years as a (NBA) player,\u201d he said. Redick said the past three years \u2013 in which he\u2019s worked as a podcaster and ESPN analyst \u2013 have been invaluable in his preparation. \u201cBeing able to connect with the players, talking to them on the podcast, being in coaching interviews with ESPN calling games, analyzing the game in three different formats. All of that has helped prepare me to be an NBA head coach,\u201d he said Redick played 15 seasons in the league for six teams before becoming an NBA analyst for ESPN in 2021. Asked by a reporter whether he had heard any misconceptions or concerns about himself in recent weeks during the hiring process that he felt the need to dispel, Redick was blunt. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid question, and I\u2019ve certainly heard everything. \u2026 However, I don\u2019t really have a great answer for your question because I really don\u2019t give a f**k. Like honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to coach the Lakers. I want to coach the team. I don\u2019t want to dispel anything\u2026 I want to become a great coach in the NBA.\u201d The man who hired Redick said he was always on their A-list. \u201cIt was very evident that he had a unique perspective and philosophy on basketball and how it\u2019s to be taught,\u201d Lakers Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Rob Pelinka said at the news conference. Pelinka said he and Redick share \u201ca basketball philosophy that was very similar and it was based on high level strategy, it was based on a certain way of communicating with players and teaching them,\u201d as well as \u201cprioritizing player development.\u201d Redick indicated he\u2019d like to see Lakers star forward and the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer LeBron James take more threes after shooting better than 40% this season, but he still needs to have a conversation with James. \u201cYou have to certainly get buy-in and talk to him about how he wants to play,\u201d Redick said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just figuring out in the half court, putting him in different spots both as a scorer and a facillitator.\u201d Redick co-hosts a basketball podcast with James. But it\u2019s unclear whether he will get to coach James, who in five days has the choice of exercising a contract option or moving on\u00a0next season. James\u00a0has not directly addressed his future with the team nor whether he would return for his 22nd NBA season. On April 30,\u00a0James\u00a0posted on X, \u201cI\u2019ve seen, heard a lot of reports about my future. I said it last night and I\u2019ll say it again. I do not know yet as I\u2019m only thinking about spending time with my family & friends! \u201cWhen I know after speaking with the fam, my counsel as well as my representation about it then you guys will know.\u201d Redick said he sees nine-time all-star center Anthony Davis as a \u201chub\u201d of the team next season so the Lakers can maximize his abilities. He said he spoke to Davis about a week ago about ideas he has for Davis\u2019 roles on offense and defense. \u201cI think both of us felt really comfortable going forward with that sort of as the base starting point of how he\u2019s gonna play on this team,\u201d Redick said. This isn\u2019t the first time the Lakers have hired someone with no coaching experience to guide the team: With the team struggling in 1994, owner Jerry Buss put Magic Johnson is charge for the final 16 games, and he posted a 5-11 record before resigning and becoming a part-owner. Earlier this month, University of Connecticut men\u2019s basketball head coach Dan Hurley spurned the Lakers for their then-vacant head coaching job to stay and chase a third-straight national title with the Huskies. The Lakers had offered the coach of the defending back-to-back NCAA champion Huskies a six-year, $70 million contract, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. Redick said he had no issues with the Lakers\u2019 pursuit of Hurley. \u201cAt no point was my ego or feelings hurt or bruised in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cDan Hurley is a two-time national champion at UConn. I am a two-time 55 Swiss league champion in the 3rd and 4th grade division \u2013 like, I understood.\u201d Last season, Los Angeles was eliminated from the playoffs in five games, losing to the then-reigning champion Denver Nuggets for the second straight postseason. The Lakers currently hold the 17th selection in Thursday\u2019s 2024 NBA Draft.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/sport/lakers-coach-jj-redick-first-news-conference/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_style_las-vegas-mystery-monolith-removed-intl-hnk", "text": "A strange monolith\u00a0found jutting out of the rocks\u00a0in a remote mountain range near Las Vegas has been taken down by authorities. How it got there is still unsolved. \u201cIt remains unknown how the item got to its location or who might be responsible,\u201d Las Vegas police said Friday in a series of posts on X announcing the removal of the glimmering, 6-foot-4 prism. Its discovery over the previous weekend, and quick removal because of public safety and environmental concerns, revived a pandemic-era mystery that captured the public\u2019s imagination when shiny monoliths evoking the object that appears in the Stanley Kubrick movie \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d began to appear around the globe. Members of the Las Vegas police search and rescue team found the object near Gass Peak, part of the vast Desert National Wildlife Refuge where bighorn sheep and desert tortoises can be found roaming. It was the latest discovery in a\u00a0series of mysterious columns that have popped up since at least 2020. In November of that year, a similar metal monolith was found deep in the Mars-like landscape of Utah\u2019s red-rock desert. Then came sightings in Romania, central California, New Mexico and on the famed Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. All of them\u00a0disappeared as quickly\u00a0as they popped up, adding to the lore. \u201cThis thing is not from another world,\u201d Lt. Nick Street of Utah\u2019s Department of Public Safety said at the time. The Utah monolith, believed to be the first in the series, had been embedded in the rock in an area so remote that officials didn\u2019t immediately reveal its location for fear of people getting lost or stranded while trying to find it. But internet sleuths quickly found the coordinates, and hordes of curious tourists eager to see and touch the otherworldly object arrived, flattening plants with their cars and leaving behind human waste in the bathroom-free backcountry. Authorities said the same concerns led them to tear down the latest monolith on Thursday. It was illegally installed on federal land established to protect bighorn sheep and is home to rare plants and desert tortoises. The Desert National Wildlife Refuge, which is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is the largest wildlife refuge outside of Alaska and can cover the state of Rhode Island twice. Christa Weise, acting manager of the wildlife refuge, confirmed Friday that the monolith had been removed but said she couldn\u2019t comment on whether federal authorities have opened a criminal investigation. The police department said the object was being kept at a secret location while authorities try to figure out the best way to dispose or store the massive structure made out of a reflective sheet of metal that was molded into a prism and secured with rebar and concrete. Photos accompanying the department\u2019s social media posts showed the object on its side after its removal, which left a large indent in the ground because the rebar had been buried deep into the dirt and rocks. The department said it \u201cdiscourages anyone from venturing off marked trails or leaving objects and items behind.\u201d \u201cThis poses a danger to you and the environment,\u201d Las Vegas police said. In Utah, the removal of the monolith there also left behind a hole in the red rock. The Bureau of Land Management said Friday that it was still actively investigating the Utah case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/style/las-vegas-mystery-monolith-removed-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

In footage released by North Korean state media agency KCNA on Thursday, the two autocrats appear to enjoy each other\u2019s company as they take a jaunt in the Aurus luxury car. The carefully-choreographed moment shows Putin taking a turn in the driving seat first while Kim sits in the passenger seat, before the two swap places. The images are designed to highlight the close bond between the leaders, who say they have ramped up ties to a \u201cnew level\u201d during the Russian president\u2019s rare visit to the reclusive state this week. North Korea and Russia inked a new defense pact during the visit, pledging to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked. The pact, which comes against the backdrop of Putin\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine, is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. It also consolidates the Kim regime\u2019s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council. On Wednesday, Putin presented Kim with an Aurus car as the pair exchanged gifts, according to Russian state media \u2013 the second time the Kremlin leader has given his counterpart this car model. According to Putin\u2019s aide Yuri Ushakov, the Russian leader also presented Kim with a tea set. Footage from KCNA showed Putin in return receiving a pair of native Pungsan hunting dogs \u2013 the same breed Kim gifted to former South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018 during a breakthrough in the two countries\u2019 relations. Putin\u2019s trip has been a very public display of the strong relations between Russia and North Korea, whose alignment has deepened in the face of shared animosity toward the West. The Russian leader landed in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday morning local time, exactly 24 years to the day that he was last in Pyongyang, amid international concerns over the two countries\u2019 military cooperation. During the visit, the two leaders announced a new strategic partnership driven by Moscow\u2019s need for weapons in its war in Ukraine. In remarks ahead of talks between the two, Kim voiced his \u201cfull support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people,\u201d pointing specifically to Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine \u201cto protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.\u201d Putin, for his part, hailed the countries\u2019 ties as based on \u201cequality and mutual respect.\u201d The burgeoning relationship has sparked concern in both Seoul and Washington, not only over North Korea\u2019s arms transfers to Russia, but also the prospect of Moscow transferring its superior military technology to aid Pyongyang\u2019s heavily sanctioned weapons program. After his visit to North Korea, Putin landed in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi as he continues his attempts to boost economic ties with friendly countries amid Western isolation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/europe/putin-kim-north-korea-limousine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_sport_barnabas-varga-injury-szoboszlai-hungary-scotland-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai has called for a change to medical protocols after the team\u2019s striker, Barnab\u00e1s Varga, sustained a serious injury during its match against Scotland on Sunday at Euro 2024. Varga fell to the ground after appearing to collide with Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn in the Scotland box midway through the second half. The 29-year-old\u2019s teammates could be seen signaling for medical attention to be brought onto the pitch to help Varga. When it arrived, sheets were raised around him while he received treatment. Subsequently, 10 minutes of stoppage time was added to the end of the Group A match at the Stuttgart Arena. Cameras showed Szoboszlai seemingly in tears after the incident and appeared to be concerned at the speed at which the stretcher was being carried onto the pitch to help Varga. The Hungary captain then helped run with the stretcher in an effort to speed up the process. Varga was eventually taken off the field to applause from both sets of fans. Shortly after the game \u2013 in which Hungary\u2019s Kevin Csoboth scored a 100th-minute winner to give them a chance of qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition \u2013 the Hungarian FA confirmed that Varga was in a \u201cstable\u201d condition in a nearby hospital and that he had concussion and a broken cheekbone which required surgery. \u201cIt looked bad, it was bad, he felt bad,\u201d Szoboszlai told reporters as he reflected on Varga\u2019s injury. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what the [medical] protocol [is], I don\u2019t know how it works but if our doctors say we need someone immediately to help, then I don\u2019t think they should walk. \u201cIt\u2019s not my decision but I think we need to change something. Even if somebody is on the ground, and you see that it was a big crash then just go [onto the pitch]. Even if the referee is saying don\u2019t go on, just go on. And if you see it\u2019s nothing serious, then you can just go down and its finished. But seconds can help a lot.\u201d When contacted by CNN about whether it was reviewing its medical procedures, UEFA \u2013 European soccer\u2019s governing body \u2013 said in a statement: \u201cWith regards to the medical intervention following the head injury suffered by Barnab\u00e1s Varga of Hungary, we would like to clarify that the intervention of the team doctor happened within 15 seconds of the incident, followed immediately by the second stadium doctor, to conduct a first assessment of the injury and provide appropriate treatment, as per customary medical procedures. \u201cThe qualified pitchside emergency team were waiting pitchside, according to their protocol, and arrived with the stretcher as soon as their intervention was requested by the medics to evacuate the player for his immediate transfer to hospital. \u201cThe coordination between all the medical staff on site was professional and everything was done in accordance with the applicable medical procedures. There was no delay in the treatment of and assistance to the player.\u201d Csoboth celebrated his late winner with a shirt with Varga\u2019s name on the back and the whole team posed with a similar shirt after the victory in support for the striker. \u201cIt was a confusing situation,\u201d Hungary coach Marco Rossi told reporters after the match. \u201cWhat I heard from the players is that Barny at that moment looked like he was not conscious so everyone was really worried about his condition and also worried about the fact that the doctors arrived a bit late, we can say. \u201cBut of course, they probably didn\u2019t realize it was a dangerous situation. Now fortunately, we can say that Barny is not under any kind of risk. \u201cProbably he will be operated in the coming hours because he suffered a fracture here [pointing to his cheek/eye socket]. But he\u2019s healthy, that\u2019s the most important thing.

{"id": "2024_06_23_middleeast_egypt-hajj-tourism-companies-revoke-licenses-intl", "text": "Saudi Arabia said Sunday that more than 1,300 people died on this year\u2019s Hajj pilgrimage \u2013 with \u201cnumerous cases\u201d due to heat stress and \u201cunauthorized\u201d trips accounting for more than four out of five of the fatalities. \u201cThe health system addressed numerous cases of heat stress this year, with some individuals still under care. Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301,\u201d the Saudi government said in a statement as it released its first official figures. The statement said 83% of those who died were \u201cunauthorized to perform Hajj\u201d and \u201cwalked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort.\u201d There were \u201cseveral elderly and chronically ill individuals\u201d among the deceased, it said, adding that the families of all the dead had now been identified. Extreme heat has been named as a main factor behind the hundreds of deaths and injuries reported this year during the Hajj. Mecca, the holy city that is central for Hajj pilgrims, saw temperatures soar to a record-setting 125 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday. Various authorities have also said the problems have been compounded by the number of unofficial pilgrimages. Saudi Arabia requires each pilgrim to acquire one of the 1.8 million available licenses to legally access Mecca. These licenses can cost several thousand US dollars. Unlicensed pilgrims typically don\u2019t travel in organized tour buses with air conditioning or easy access to water and food supplies. The Saudi government also appeared to suggest the unauthorized nature of many of the trips had been a factor in how long it had taken to issue an official death toll as this had complicated the identification process. \u201cIdentification completed, despite the initial lack of personal information or identification documents. Proper processes were followed for identification, burial, and honoring the deceased, with death certificates provided,\u201d the statement said. Some pilgrims have lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of this year\u2019s Hajj. Even pilgrims on official tours spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in the scorching heat. Some witnesses have told CNN of how they saw worshipers losing consciousness and walked past bodies covered in white cloth. Egypt to clamp down on illegal pilgrimages The announcement from Saudi Arabia comes as the Egyptian government vowed to revoke the licenses of 16 Hajj tourism companies involved in making illegal pilgrimages to Mecca and refer the company\u2019s managers to the public prosecutor amid fears hundreds of Egyptians are among the dead. Egypt\u2019s decision was made in a cabinet meeting on Saturday after a report highlighted the dubious nature of how some tourism companies operate. The official toll among Egyptians stands at 31, but it is being reported by Reuters news agency and other outlets that as many as 500 to 600 Egyptians died during the pilgrimage. The report, which was reviewed by cabinet, said some operators had not issued correct visas, so holders could not enter the holy city of Mecca and were instead forced to enter \u201cthrough desert paths on foot.\u201d It also accused some companies of failing to provide proper accommodation, leaving tourists exposed to the heat. In the meeting, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly offered his \u201csincere condolences and sympathy\u201d to the families of the deceased pilgrims committing to providing them with the necessary support. Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and Saudi Arabia requires each pilgrim to acquire one of the 1.8 million available licenses to legally access Mecca. But as the cost of one of these licences costs several thousand US dollars, many pilgrims try to access the site illegally and typically don\u2019t travel in organized tour buses with air conditioning or easy access to water and food supplies. The timing of the Hajj is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar which this year has fallen during scorching temperatures in Saudi Arabia. Pilgrims made this year\u2019s journey in extreme temperatures of up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). Ahmed, a 44-year-old from Indonesia, told CNN he saw many people falling ill and even dying from the heat. \u201cAlong the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom [white fabric] cloth.\u201d \u201cEvery time there is a distribution of water from local residents or certain groups, it is immediately overrun by the pilgrims,\u201d he added, saying that he didn\u2019t see health workers or a single ambulance along the road. As part of the pilgrimage, the faithful perform a series of rituals in and around the holy city of Mecca, often involving many hours of walking in the scorching heat every day. The exact death toll for the total number of deaths in this year\u2019s Hajj may still rise, as governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and travelled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/middleeast/egypt-hajj-tourism-companies-revoke-licenses-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_22_middleeast_rapper-toomaj-death-sentence-iran-overturn-intl-latam", "text": "Iranian dissident rapper Toomaj Salehi had his death sentence overturned by the Iranian Supreme Court this week in what his lawyers have deemed a victory for human rights in Iran. Salehi had become a key voice of anti-government dissent in Iran, strongly criticizing the repressive nature of the Iranian regime through his musical output and social media posts. In October 2022, as fervent demonstrations gripped Iran following the death of a young girl, Mahsa Amini in morality police custody, Salehi threw his support behind the protest movement. Salehi has claimed he was tortured and placed in solitary detention after being initially arrested in October 2022 for his involvement in the protest movement. After being briefly released from prison in 2023, Salehi was re-arrested for \u201cmaking false claims and spreading lies,\u201d according to Iranian judiciary news agency Mizan. He was then sentenced to death in May this year. A lower court in the central city of Isfahan found him guilty of the crime of \u201ccorruption on earth,\u201d issuing the maximum punishment of death. On Saturday, his lawyer Amir Raesian broke the news of the reversal\u00a0in a post on X, saying that the Iranian Supreme Court had \u201cavoided irreparable judicial error\u201d and overturned Salehi\u2019s death sentence this week. In its judgment, Iran\u2019s highest court found previous prison sentences handed down to Salehi to be \u201cin excess of legal punishment.\u201d The news was welcomed by the campaign group Index on Censorship which has lobbied strongly for the rapper\u2019s release and worked closely with a team of international human rights lawyers based in London\u2019s Doughty Street Chambers to reverse his death sentence. \u201cIt [the judgment] is a clear demonstration of the injustice of the lower court decision, and we are delighted that Salehi no longer faces the threat of execution. The Supreme Court found that the death sentence delivered to Salehi was excessive and failed to comply with Iranian law,\u201d the group said in a statement Saturday. Salehi\u2019s case will now referred back to the lower court in Isfahan for re-sentencing, Index On Censorship said, decrying the prospect of any further jail time for the rapper. \u201cEven a shorter period of imprisonment would be an injustice: Salehi has done nothing other than to call for his, and other Iranians\u2019, fundamental rights to be respected,\u201d the group added. London-based human rights lawyer Caoilfhionn Gallagher who is the international counsel for the Salehi family said it was \u201cnot enough\u201d that his life had been \u201cspared\u201d by the Iranian authorities. Gallagher who alongside a team of colleagues filed an urgent appeal to the UN regarding Salehi\u2019s case back in May, called once again for his \u201cunconditional\u201d release. \u201cWe urge the international community to keep the pressure up at this critical time, to secure Salehi\u2019s freedom and hold Iran to account for its egregious violations of international human rights law,\u201d Gallagher said in the Index On Censorship statement. The campaign to secure Salehi\u2019s release has won support from high-profile voices across the globe. The Recording Academy which organises the Grammy Awards, put out a statement in April saying it was \u201cdeeply troubled by the recent news regarding Toomaj Salehi.\u201d \u201cNo artist anywhere should have to fear for their life or livelihood when expressing themselves through their art,\u201d the statement added.

Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022\u00a0More than 11 million people are under a tornado watch: A tornado watch was issued Sunday for much of New England, including the entire states of Vermont and New Hampshire and parts of New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The threat continues until 8 p.m. ET for cities including Burlington, Vermont; Albany, New York; Hartford, Connecticut; Providence, Rhode Island; and Portland, Maine, plus the suburbs of Boston. A line of strong thunderstorms could bring tornadoes, damaging winds up to 70 mph and hail the size of ping pong balls, according to the Storm Prediction Center.  \u2022\u00a0Heat wave shifts to mid-Atlantic: As heat alerts persist for over 100 million people over the weekend, the\u00a0extreme heat risk\u00a0will spread from the Ohio Valley on Saturday to the mid-Atlantic on Sunday. Highs across the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic have been 10 to 15 degrees above average. \u201cAn intense heat wave will continue across the Mid-Atlantic, where record high temperatures are likely. In the West, triple-digit high temperatures are possible in central and southern California, Arizona, and Utah,\u201d the National Weather Service said Sunday on its website. \u2022\u00a0Temperatures break records: Triple-digit heat broiled Baltimore and Washington, DC, on Saturday. The nation\u2019s capital hit the 100-degree mark Saturday \u2014 the first time that\u2019s happened since 2016. It\u2019s also the first time DC has recorded a temperature that high this early in the summer since 2012. Baltimore also hit 101 degrees, breaking the daily record of 100 degrees set back in 1988. The combination of this heat coming early in the summer season and persisting over several days \u201cincreases the level of heat stress for those without reliable air conditioning,\u201d the weather service said. \u2022 Iowa flooding prompts evacuations and disaster proclamation: In Rock Valley, Iowa, all homes north of Highway 18 were evacuated amid high floodwaters Saturday. \u201cI cannot even believe what I\u2019m seeing right now,\u201d said Daniel Heitritter, who evacuated his neighborhood in Spencer on Saturday. As water in his home reached shin-deep, he flagged down a boat to come pick him, his wife and cat up, he said. On Saturday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties in northwest Iowa and directed all available state resources to assist Rock Valley and other communities in response to \u201ccatastrophic flooding.\u201d On Sunday, Reynolds said she submitted a request for an expedited presidential major disaster declaration. She is asking for additional federal assistance for nine counties and public assistance for 22 counties. \u2022\u00a0People rescued from rising water in South Dakota: In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people were rescued from rising water due to heavy rain, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith. Emergency personnel responded to five stranded drivers, 30 vehicles stalled in water, 10 calls regarding water problems and 75 traffic accidents, according to Smith. City of Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken on Saturday signed an emergency declaration in response to the flooding. The cumulative rainfall amounts for the Sioux Falls region range from 6.5 to 8 inches over the last 72 hours, TenHaken said. \u2022 Emergency flood operations readied in Minnesota: Parts of Minnesota were under flood warnings Saturday night, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to declare an emergency authorizing the Minnesota National Guard \u201cto be available to provide support for emergency flood operations as areas across the state experience extreme flood conditions,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. Water in lakes Tetonka and Sakatah has reached \u201cuncontrollable\u201d levels. \u201cResidents have been evacuated and the flood has already caused significant damage,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cIntense rain has had catastrophic effects. Flooding has left entire communities under feet of water, causing severe damage to property and numerous road closures,\u201d Walz said in a statement. The warnings were still in effect on Sunday for southern parts of the state, as well as northwest Iowa and southeast South Dakota.  \u2022 New Mexico residents to return home after wildfire: The Salt and South Fork blazes in New Mexico have together burned over 25,300 acres. The South Fork Fire was 31% contained and the Salt Fire was 7% contained as of Sunday morning. Residents of the village of Ruidoso will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and officials advised them to bring at least a week\u2019s worth of food and drinking water as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Although rain in the area could help with fire suppression, it can also cause flooding as well as mud and debris flows\u00a0in the burn scars. Meanwhile, the FBI is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading them to the cause of the wildfires. \u2022 Storms move into Northeast: Severe thunderstorms were pouring down on areas of New England on Sunday, and a severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for parts of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia until 10 p.m. ET. There is also an excessive risk of rainfall in the Upper Midwest on Monday and Tuesday. New England is facing the potential for damaging winds, a few tornadoes and isolated hail, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Elsewhere, monsoon-like conditions may also produce isolated flash flooding in the Four Corners region, the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/weather/flooding-upper-midwest-heat-wave-mid-atlantic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Opposition figure Leila De Lima, who was released on bail last November after\u00a0she was acquitted of two counts, was cleared of a third and final charge on Monday, her lawyer told state broadcaster PTV. The charges stemmed from allegations by Duterte that De Lima had received payoffs from convicted drug gangs to fund her 2016 senatorial bid. More than 6,000 people were killed in\u00a0anti-drug operations\u00a0during Duterte\u2019s tenure as president from 2016 to 2022, according to police data. Many of the extrajudicial killings of suspected drug offenders took place in the poorest areas of the country \u2013 and independent monitors believe the number of those killed could be much higher. Human rights activists had long criticized De Lima\u2019s prosecution and lengthy detention, pointing out that she was held in a police cell despite not having been convicted of any charges. They say her treatment is emblematic of a deteriorating rights situation in a country where political activists and the media often face threats, harassment and even death for attempting to keep those in power in check. On Monday, supporters who gathered outside the courthouse in Muntinlupa city shouted, \u201cLeila is free,\u201d according to a livestreamed video posted on her official Facebook page. Speaking to reporters outside the court, De Lima said\u00a0Duterte would be held responsible for \u201csins committed\u201d against Filipinos. \u201cI\u2019m only one of the victims. Thousands of Filipinos were murdered during the bloody and fake \u2018drug war.\u2019 Many families lost loved ones,\u201d she said. \u201cFor those who weren\u2019t killed, they were left languishing in jail because of the incorrect and twisted enforcement of the law. I\u2019m one of those who have experienced unjust imprisonment.\u201d During his tenure as president, Duterte\u00a0repeatedly said the\u00a0killings\u00a0of\u00a0drug\u00a0suspects are lawful if police are acting in self defense. He had previously admitted to killing drug suspects\u00a0during his time as mayor of Davao City. In July last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC)\u00a0rejected an appeal by the Philippine government to block an investigation by prosecutors into Duterte\u2019s drug war. An ICC judge said the dismissal by the Hague-based court meant the Philippines has exhausted its options to appeal. Duterte\u2019s administration and its successor under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have pushed back against the ICC\u2019s probe, denouncing the investigations as unjust. The Philippines was formerly a signatory to the ICC but Duterte canceled the country\u2019s membership after the court began probing his drug war. But under the ICC\u2019s withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state \u2013 in this case, between 2016 and 2019, when the Philippines\u2019 pullout became official.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/philippines-leila-de-lima-acquitted-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

The strike hit the tents of displaced people in the Palestinian town of Mawasi, parts of which have been identified by the Israeli military as a humanitarian zone. Israel has been intensifying its operation in nearby Rafah, where it launched an offensive last month as part of its campaign to dismantle Hamas in Gaza. Following the strike, a nearby Red Cross field hospital received 22 bodies and 45 injured, the ICRC said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) blamed Israel for the strike, saying it was dealing with extensive casualties. The Gaza Ministry of Health said that 25 people were killed and 50 wounded in the attack. CNN is unable to confirm the casualty figures. The IDF said Saturday\u00a0that it was examining the incident. \u201cFollowing an initial inquiry, there was no direct attack carried out by the IDF against a Red Cross facility. The incident will be quickly examined and its findings will be presented to our international partners.\u201d The Ministry of Health in Gaza has meanwhile reported its highest death toll in the Gaza Strip over a 24 hour period since June 9. The ministry said that 101 people had been killed in the last day, and a further 169 injured. According to the ICRC, one of its facilities was damaged in Friday\u2019s strike. In a post on X, the\u00a0ICRC\u00a0did not attribute responsibility for the strike but said that \u201cThe\u00a0ICRC\u00a0office \u2013 which is surrounded by hundreds of displaced civilians living in tents \u2013 was damaged by nearby shelling in Gaza. Firing so dangerously close to humanitarian structures puts the lives of civilians and humanitarians at risk.\u201d It said \u201cheavy-caliber projectiles\u201d had landed within meters of the facility. The\u00a0ICRC\u00a0said that the incident was one of several in recent days after stray bullets had hit\u00a0ICRC\u00a0structures. It said parties to the conflict had an obligation to take \u201call feasible precautions to avoid harm to civilians.\u201d The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, posted on X Saturday that the EU \u201ccondemns the shelling which damaged the ICRC office in Gaza and led to dozens of casualties.\u201d \u201cAn independent investigation is needed and those responsible must be held accountable,\u201d Borrell said. Expansion into Rafah Tens of thousands of people have fled to Mawasi in recent weeks as Israeli operations have expanded in Rafah, just to the south. In recent days, Israeli military operations have pushed towards the west and north of Rafah, according to accounts from inside Gaza, and the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) says it has encountered considerable resistance from Hamas fighters. PRCS spokesman Raed al-Nims told CNN Saturday that the Israeli army \u201cis intensively targeting what it said were safe areas in Mawasi, Khan Younis and Rafah.\u201d The PRCS said that \u201cin Rafah, the situation is very difficult. There are numbers of martyrs on the roads and in the camps that no-one can reach.\u201d Mohammed Al-Mughair, a Civil Defense official in Rafah, told CNN that parts of central and western Rafah had come under fire since Friday and the Israeli army was now about one kilometer from the coast. For its part, the Israeli military said Saturday troops are continuing \u201cintelligence-based, targeted operations in the Rafah area.\u201d Meanwhile, the closure of the Rafah crossing from Egypt, and insecurity close to the Kerem Shalom crossing into southern Gaza, has led to severe shortages of humanitarian aid, according to several agencies. The total number of deaths in the Gaza Strip since October 7 now stands at 37,551, with 85,911 injuries, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned that the situation in Gaza has become one of \u201ctotal lawlessness.,\u201d hampering efforts to deliver aid. Guterres said: \u201cMost of the trucks with humanitarian aid inside Gaza are now looted, because this is a war that is different from any other one.\u201d \u201cUsually, in a war there is one force that attacks, they occupy part of the territory of the force, then they guarantee security and management of the areas that they occupy.

{"id": "2024_06_24_sport_euro-2024-italy-croatia-spain-albania-spt-intl", "text": "Mattia Zaccagni\u2019s last-minute stunner earned Italy a 1-1 draw and sent the defending champion through to the last-16 of Euro 2024, breaking Croatia\u2019s hearts in the process. Luka Modri\u0107\u2019s goal 10 minutes into the second half after he had just missed a penalty looked like it would be enough to earn the\u00a0Vatreni\u00a0a place in the knockout stages. But Zaccagni had other ideas, latching onto Riccardo Calafiori\u2019s pass in the 98th minute and bending his shot past the outstretched hand of Dominik Livakovi\u0107 and into the top corner. It proved to be the penultimate kick of the match as the referee blew for full-time immediately after the restart, the distraught Croatia players, only seconds earlier on the brink of glory, sinking to the turf. Modri\u0107 cut a forlorn figure on the bench and buried his face in his hands. Spain, meanwhile, beat Albania 1-0 off a tidy first-half Ferr\u00e1n Torres goal from Dani Olmo\u2019s through ball to finish top of Group B with nine points from nine. Late drama Croatia has proven to be a real bogey team for Italy over the years. The\u00a0Azzurri\u00a0hadn\u2019t tasted victory over Monday\u2019s opponent in their previous eight meetings, a run stretching back to November 1994. Italy\u2019s only previous win in this fixture came when the two sides first met back in 1942. A chastening 3-0 defeat to Spain in Croatia\u2019s opening game of Euro 2024 threw up questions about whether this was a tournament too far for an aging team, questions that certainly were not answered in a 2-2 draw with Albania. But Italy has been similarly underwhelming so far in Germany, scraping a 2-1 win over Albania before being utterly outplayed by\u00a0La Roja\u00a0in a game the Italians were likely delighted to see end only 1-0. It was a relatively subdued opening 25 minutes; perhaps nerves and the precariousness of the situation were so far getting the better of the two teams. Luka Su\u010di\u0107 saw an early long-range strike tipped over the bar by Gianluigi Donnarumma \u2013 one of the players of the tournament \u2013 before Italy defender Mateo Retegui had a header blocked behind for a corner kick. But Italy should have been ahead just minutes later when Nicol\u00f2 Barella\u2019s delightful cross found Alessandro Bastoni completely unmarked at the far post, only for a stunning save from Livakovi\u0107 to deny what looked a certain goal. The\u00a0Azzurri\u00a0had shown by far the most intent of the two sides and, though Croatia grew into the half as it wore on, Italy continued to look dangerous as Lorenzo Pellegrini brought another smart save out of Livakovi\u0107 with a low strike from the edge of the area. It was a strangely subdued first half from a Croatia side that will have known that only a point would very likely not be enough to see the team through to the knockout stages. But the half-time substitution of Ante Budimir for Mario Pa\u0161ali\u0107 instantly transformed the team. Croatia dominated the early exchanges and had a glorious opportunity to take the lead from the penalty spot when a VAR review concluded Davide Frattesi handled the ball inside the area. Modric saw his weak penalty kick saved by Donnarumma, only for the ball to fall back to the Croatia captain\u2019s feet less than a minute later. This time, he made no mistake, firing the ball into the roof of the net after the Italian keeper had denied Budimir from close range. Italy had the chance to respond almost immediately when Bastoni was left unmarked at a corner kick, but the defender spurned another glorious opportunity, this time placing his header over the crossbar. If the scored stayed the same, Bastoni more than most would have been in for a few sleepless nights while Italy waited to find out whether it would reach the last 16 as one of the four best third-placed teams. Fortunately for Bastoni, however, that nervous wait was avoided when Zaccagni made himself the unlikely hero with his first international goal, curling a sublime first-time effort into the top corner with unerring accuracy. No matter how unconvincing Italy look, underestimate the\u00a0Azzurri\u00a0at your peril. Few teams in world football know how to eke out a result when it matters the most and there will not be a country that relishes the prospect of facing this resilient Italy team.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/sport/euro-2024-italy-croatia-spain-albania-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_24_asia_us-aircraft-carrier-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "A United States Navy aircraft carrier has arrived in South Korea for a show of force as Washington, Seoul and Tokyo released a joint statement on Monday condemning deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia. The nuclear-powered USS Theodore Roosevelt docked in the port of Busan on Saturday ahead of trilateral exercises with South Korea and Japan in the waters near the peninsula. The Freedom Edge exercises resulted from an agreement made by the defense chiefs of the US, South Korea and Japan before Russian leader Vladimir Putin made his high-profile  trip to Pyongyang last week. But the strongly worded joint statement the three partners released Monday shows the gravity with which they view a new \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d between North Korea and Russia made during Putin\u2019s trip. Besides signing the defense deal with Kim Jong Un, Putin also linked security on the Korean Peninsula to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, threatening to arm North Korea should South Korea provide military aid to Kyiv. The US, South Korea and Japan \u201ccondemn in the strongest possible terms deepening military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia,\u201d the joint statement said, using the acronym for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, North Korea\u2019s official name. Deepened ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, and the mutual defense pact \u201cshould be of grave concern to anyone with an interest in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, upholding the global non-proliferation regime, and supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia\u2019s brutal aggression,\u201d it said. The joint statement comes after all three partners separately expressed deep concerns over the treaty, including South Korea condemning it and summoning Russia\u2019s ambassador on Friday, a rare diplomatic step that illustrates the soured tensions between Seoul and Moscow. The aircraft carrier\u2019s presence in Busan is just the latest in a series of US military moves to show Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to its own treaty ally in South Korea. Earlier this month, US Air Force B-1B bombers participated in a live-fire exercise on the peninsula, the first time in seven years those long-range strike aircraft have dropped live munitions in South Korea. And last week, a US Air Force AC-130 gunship also performed live-fire strikes on the same range where the B-1s dropped their bombs. Joint drills with the US have long been a source of frustration and ire for North Korea which has pressed ahead with its illegal nuclear weapons program and missile testing under Kim, who has found a common cause with Putin. Russia, which once supported sanctions on North Korea, used its veto power in the United Nations earlier this year to shield Pyongyang from further scrutiny and Putin has backed often backed Kim\u2019s narrative. \u201cThis confrontational policy on the part of the US to expand its military infrastructure in the subregion was accompanied by significant increases in the intensity and scale of military drills involving South Korea and Japan that are hostile towards North Korea,\u201d Putin said in Pyongyang on Wednesday. The visit of the USS Theodore Roosevelt to Busan marks the second time a Nimitz-class carrier has visited South Korea in seven months. The USS Carl Vinson called in Busan last November. The Roosevelt, with some 5,000 personnel aboard, carries an air wing of more than 60 aircraft, including F/A-18 Super Hornet fighters. The presence of the Roosevelt and its carrier strike group of supporting warships \u201cdemonstrates the solid combined defense posture and resolute will of the South Korea-US alliance to respond to the sophisticating threat from North Korea,\u201d a statement from the South Korean military said. Neither the US nor South Korea would give details or exact dates of the upcoming Freedom Edge exercise. But the three have been working more closely together, including recent exercises involving forces from all three countries. The Pentagon on Sunday gave a clue as to the timing of the Freedom Edge exercise, releasing a statement saying the Roosevelt would be departing the Indo-Pacific theater next week and heading to the Middle East to replace the carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Eisenhower left the region on Saturday after more than seven months of operations that included attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen to protect commercial shipping in the region from the Iran-backed group\u2019s missiles and drones. The movement of the Roosevelt from the western Pacific leaves temporarily only one US carrier in the region, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is homeported in Yokosuka, Japan.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/us-aircraft-carrier-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Putin\u2019s remarks, at the end of a state visit to Vietnam, capped off a week in which Moscow sought to rattle the West and project strength from a part of the world in which his influence still carries weight. \u201cThose who supply these weapons believe that they are not at war with us. I said, including in Pyongyang, that we then reserve the right to supply weapons to other regions of the world,\u201d Putin told reporters Thursday at the end of his trip to Hanoi, in response to a question on whether the supply of Western long-range weapons could be considered an act of aggression. \u201cWhere they will go next?\u201d he said, suggesting those countries could then sell the weapons to Western adversaries. The US called Putin\u2019s remarks \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d in a briefing on Friday. \u201cIt would destabilize the Korean Peninsula,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters, and \u201cdepending on the type of weapons they provide, might violate UN Security Council resolutions that Russia itself has supported.\u201d Russia and North Korea\u2019s signing of a mutual defense pact this week sent ripples out across the region, with South Korea summoning Moscow\u2019s envoy on Friday, and Japan and the United States voicing serious concern. The defense pact, which comes against the backdrop of Putin\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine, is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. The deal was inked on Wednesday during Putin\u2019s trip to Pyongyang, where he received a lavish welcome from fellow autocrat Kim Jong Un, North Korea\u2019s leader. It consolidates the Kim regime\u2019s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council and means Russia now has a defense pact with South Korea\u2019s biggest enemy. South Korea, a US ally, condemned the treaty and summoned Russia\u2019s ambassador on Friday, a rare diplomatic step that illustrates the soured tensions between Seoul and Moscow. First Vice Minister Kim Hong-kyun relayed the South Korean government\u2019s \u201cstern position\u201d on Kim and Putin\u2019s defense pact, urging Moscow to \u201cimmediately halt military cooperation\u201d with Pyongyang and abide by UN Security Council resolutions, the Foreign Ministry said. Kim told the Russian ambassador that \u201cany cooperation that could directly or indirectly help reinforce the North Korean military power is a violation of the UN Security Council resolution,\u201d adding that Russia, a permanent member of the UNSC, should \u201cact responsibly,\u201d according to the ministry. An official of the US military, which maintains almost 30,000 troops in South Korea, told CNN the closer Russia-North Korea ties were troubling. \u201cThese developments should concern any country that cares about maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,\u00a0abiding by UN Security Council resolutions, and\u00a0supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia\u2019s brutal invasion,\u201d the military official said. New threats Putin flew to Vietnam on Thursday where he renewed threats towards both Western powers and their partners in Asia. Speaking to Russian journalists at the end of the visit he\u00a0accused\u00a0NATO\u00a0of \u201ccreating a threat\u201d for Russia in Asia. \u201cAnd we see what\u2019s happening in Asia, right? The bloc system is being cobbled together in Asia.\u00a0NATO\u00a0is already moving there as a permanent place of residence. This, of course, creates a threat for all countries in the region, including the Russian Federation. We are obliged to respond to this and will do so,\u201d\u00a0Putin\u00a0said. Putin warned South\u00a0Korea\u00a0on Thursday it would be making \u201ca very big mistake\u201d if it decided to supply arms to Ukraine, claiming Seoul has \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d concerning the new strategic partnership signed by Russia and North\u00a0Korea. \u201cAs far as I know, the Republic of Korea does not plan aggression against the DPRK, which means there is no need to be afraid of our cooperation in this area,\u201d he said. But at the same time, senior Russian government officials were warning that Moscow planned to send weapons to North Korea. \u201cI wonder what the people of this country (South Korea) will say when they see the latest Russian weapons from their closest neighbors \u2013 our partners from the DPRK?\u201d senior Russian official\u00a0Dmitry Medvedev said in a post on Telegram. US and South Korean forces hold regular exercises and training in and around the Korean Peninsula, and the two allies have been working more closely with Japan, including recent exercises involving forces from all three countries. National Security Director Chang Ho-jin said South Korea would review the issue of arms provision to Ukraine, but he also noted that Seoul was willing to wait for the Russian government\u2019s explanation of the results of the meeting between Putin and Kim Jong Un. Currently, South Korea\u2019s policy is not to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine. When later asked about those comments, Putin said: \u201cAs for the supply of lethal weapons to the combat zone in Ukraine, this would be a very big mistake. I hope that this will not happen. If this happens, then we will also make appropriate decisions, which are unlikely to please the current leadership of South Korea.\u201d Reports from earlier in the war say South Korea may have provided 155mm artillery shells to the United States to replace 155mm rounds sent to Ukraine. A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said South Korea\u2019s stockpile of 105mm howitzer rounds could give Ukraine an important battlefield boost if it were released to Kyiv. \u201cPublic reports\u00a0suggest\u00a0South Korea has around 3.4 million 105mm artillery shells,\u201d the CSIS report said. Ukraine has about 100 105mm artillery pieces, the report said. \u201cDuring the Vietnam War, these lighter howitzers proved indispensable in firebases, given their high mobility by road and air. Their light weight and mobility would allow Ukrainian artillery units to relocate quickly after firing, a crucial tactic for survivability on the modern battlefield. These howitzers would also allow Ukrainian battlefield commanders to conduct attacks on rough terrain against high-value targets,\u201d the CSIS report said Earlier on Thursday, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi also expressed strong concern about the agreement signed by\u00a0Russia and North Korea. The fact that Putin \u201cdid not rule out military-technical cooperation with North Korea, which could be a direct violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, is a point of serious concern from the perspective of its possible impact on the security environment surrounding our country,\u201d Hayashi\u00a0said in a press conference.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/asia/putin-ukraine-north-korea-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

After winning the semifinal earlier in the day, Lyles tied his personal best of 9.83 seconds to cross the line first in the final and punch his ticket to France. He was followed by Kenny Bednarek in second with a time 9.87 seconds (a personal best), while Fred Kerley was third with a season\u2019s best 9.88. Both sprinters \u2013 who won a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in the 100m and 200m respectively \u2013 also qualified for Paris. Lyles \u2013 the reigning 100m, 200m and 4 x 100m relay world champion \u2013 missed out on the 100m in Tokyo after finishing seventh at the trials. He made it into the 200m event however, winning a bronze medal. \u201cThree years ago I got second to last. This year I came and won it,\u201d he told reporters after the race. \u201cPart of the plan. Nothing changed. Might be a shock to everybody else, but when you know the goal, you know the goal. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t get that third place in Tokyo, I wouldn\u2019t have had that desire. I wouldn\u2019t have had that fire burning. I wouldn\u2019t have accomplished what I have accomplished in the past.\u201d \u201cNow we constantly look to the future with open eyes because anything can happen,\u201d he added. Lyles appeared confident from the get-go, bouncing out ahead of his competitors and hyping up the crowd when he was introduced as the last entrant in the final. His confidence carried through to the finish line, raising his finger to the sky in celebration before the race had concluded. Lyles was made to work for his victory, though \u2013 2019 world champion Christian Coleman exploded out of the blocks to take an early lead, but began to fade around the halfway point and eventually finished in fourth place, 0.05 seconds behind Kerley. With American representation in the 100m set, Lyles will be aiming to do the double later this week by winning the 200m, which would give him the opportunity to improve upon the bronze he claimed in Tokyo three years ago. \u201cI\u2019m ready. That American record is looking vulnerable,\u201d he told the media.

{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor", "text": "Victor Miller, 42, recently filed paperwork to run for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, but it wasn\u2019t exactly for him: He listed the name of a customized AI chatbot to appear on the ballot. He argued that the chatbot, named VIC \u2013 for \u201cvirtual integrated citizen\u201d \u2013 would use technology from artificial intelligence company OpenAI to make all political decisions and help govern the city. (VIC is not affiliated with a political party.) AI has \u201chelped me in my life personally \u2026 such as helping me with my resume,\u201d Miller told CNN. \u201cI think it could add a layer to help a town. I really want to see that happen.\u201d On Tuesday, however, OpenAI told CNN it shut down Miller\u2019s access to the tool that was being used to interact with and persuade voters. Using ChatGPT in this way, according to the company, is against its policies. AI is making politics even more complicated as government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use AI tools responsibly, and the tech is advancing faster than social, legal and regulatory guardrails. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action against these uses of our technology for violating our policies against political campaigning,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told CNN. On its website, OpenAI states it prohibits \u201cengaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics.\u201d Miller said he was motivated to create VIC after he was denied access to city records about policies and procedures because he made his request anonymously. \u201cIf I was able to ask AI and interact with this new intelligence, it would have known the law and I would have gotten the records,\u201d he said. The city did not respond to request for comment on the denial of records, but Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray told CNN in a statement that he is \u201cclosely\u201d monitoring Miller\u2019s bid for mayor. \u201cWyoming law is clear that, to run for office, one must be a \u2018qualified elector,\u2019 which necessitates being a real person,\u201d Gray said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, an AI bot is not a qualified elector.\u201d He also suggested the chatbot is essentially a fig leaf for a Miller candidacy. Gray said he wrote a letter to the Cheyenne municipal clerk raising his concerns about the bid. Although the public-facing version of VIC has been removed by OpenAI, Miller said it still works on his own ChatGPT account. He plans to bring it, along with a microphone, to a local Cheyenne library and give voters the opportunity to directly ask it questions via its voice-to-text feature. OpenAI told CNN it also took action against another candidate in the UK who was using its AI models to help campaign for Parliament. Steve Endacott, chairman of an AI company called Neural Voice, answers questions from voters via AI Steve, a chatbot, on his site. He is running as an independent. Endacott did not respond to a request for comment. His website offered a ChatGPT chatbot where voters were able to leave opinions and help create policies. If a voter asked the tool a question about AI Steve\u2019s policies and it didn\u2019t have an answer, it would conduct a search and create a policy suggestion. (While his website continues to operate, the tool is no longer powered by ChatGPT.) \u2018Gimmick is the right word\u2019 Although AI chatbots are getting smarter, some experts told CNN the technology should never substitute for human judgment in running any part of government. \u201cWhen it comes to AI now and what it will be like in the future, it should never be used to make automated decisions,\u201d said Jen Golbeck, a professor at the College of Information Sciences at the University of Maryland. \u201cAI has always been designed for decision support \u2013 it gives some data to help a human make decisions but is not set up to make decisions by itself.\u201d The emergence of AI political candidates also comes amid growing concerns about how the spread of misinformation could impact elections. Earlier this year, for example, a fake recording of a candidate in Slovakia saying he rigged the election went viral. Golbeck said, however, that there may be a place for AI in politics when it comes to helping with various tasks, such as answering forms from constituents or directing how to get problems solved. \u201cYou may be able to train a chatbot with all of the knowledge found in an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the decision making should always be left to humans.\u201d David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, agreed, noting the people behind an AI candidacy are leaning into \u201ca cultural moment\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. \u201cGimmick is the right word for it,\u201d Karpf told CNN. \u201cChatGPT is not qualified to run your government.\u201d Karpf said he doesn\u2019t believe lawmakers need to make formal legislation around AI chatbots running for office because \u201cno one is going to vote for an AI chatbot to run a city.\u201d Karpf believes that the timing of these cases is noteworthy, too. \u201cWe have a very serious election coming up, and I don\u2019t mind levity in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is: We should laugh for a minute and get back to work.\u201d But Miller said he hopes the attention around his efforts inspires more AI candidates in the months ahead. \u201cI think this can expand beyond the mayor and Parliament, and [reach the whole] world,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_americas_migration-us-mexico-border-tohono-oodham-intl-latam", "text": "The thermometer hit 111 Fahrenheit\u00a0as we rolled up to a battered tent deep in the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation reservation in Arizona.\u00a0Under its shade lay around a dozen dazed looking families, many with small children.\u00a0A stressed-looking mother of two paced back and forth. They had walked for five hours to get here, and had been waiting all day. But they looked at us \u2013 and the\u00a0tribal dignitaries\u00a0on whose land they were trespassing \u2013 with only mild curiosity.\u00a0They were asylum seekers, looking for the green uniforms of US Border Patrol so that they could turn themselves in. Chairman Verlon Jose, leader of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, considered addressing them, and then turned away. \u201cThis is nothing that the nation can solve,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever I say to them is not even going to be relevant, other than our prayers for their journey.\u201d The Tohono O\u2019odham, or \u201cpeople of the desert,\u201d have lived in the Sonoran desert for thousands of years, their\u00a0ancestral\u00a0homelands stretching from what is now Pima County, Arizona, all the way to Mexico\u2019s Sea of Cortez. The\u00a0US-Mexico border now slices across those lands, a 62-mile line of low metal fencing weaves between ancient saguaro cacti and\u00a0that\u00a0marks the southern limit of the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0federal Indian reservation\u00a0\u2013 and the edge of the United States. The Tohono O\u2019odham do not recognize this border; enrolled members speak their own language, live on both sides and travel back and forth. But it has become impossible to ignore amid\u00a0record numbers of migrants crossing into the US from Mexico\u00a0and a bitter political storm over what to do with them. You could drive for miles on the sprawling Tohono O\u2019odham reservation without encountering anyone beside the free-ranging cattle. But for decades, migrants and asylum seekers, northbound drug smugglers and southbound arms traffickers, and US Border Patrol agents have roamed here in endless pursuit across the rocky terrain. The toll of all this traffic on the environment is obvious; discarded clothes, trash, diapers and even ID cards line the border. In December, during the peak of recent border crossings, thousands of asylum seekers camped out on\u00a0the Nation\u2019s territory, burning the reservation\u2019s wild mesquite trees for warmth as they waited to be apprehended. The sight of the broken branches, piles of abandoned plastic bottles and human waste left in the migrants\u2019 wake was heartbreaking to the tribe, Jose told CNN. \u201cYour heart feels for the migrants and so forth like that\u2026 but then other part says look at the destruction that they\u2019re causing us\u2026 look at the trash that they\u2019re leaving,\u201d Jose told CNN. The chairman and Arizona governor Katie Hobbs\u00a0wrote in a joint letter to the federal government last year requesting ramped up staffing and resources from the US Customs and Border\u00a0Protection (CBP)\u00a0to deal with the surge. But the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0longstanding reliance on the federal government to enforce the border means an uneasy trade of tribal sovereignty for security. Border\u00a0police have had violent run-ins with members, and the thought of a potential border wall is seen as a travesty here \u2013 a mutilation of the land itself. \u201cAll we want is safe passage to our traditional homes, to our sacred areas. The drug activity, the migrant activity is going to go on and go on. And we\u2019re caught in the middle of this,\u201d Jose said. Strangers in the desert The Tohono O\u2019odham reservation\u00a0is part of Arizona\u2019s Tucson sector and\u00a0one of the busiest immigration sectors in the country in both apprehensions of border crossers and marijuana seizures, according to the Customs and Border\u00a0Protection\u00a0website. Across the sprawling reservation, the tribe works closely with CBP, providing land for checkpoints, forward operating bases, surveillance infrastructure, and putting forward indigenous-led special units that investigate and track drug smuggling. The\u00a0Nation says that it spends an average of $3 million annually to assist with border security. Still, strangers walk onto the reservation all the time. In the small southern community of\u00a0Menagers\u00a0Dam, just a 15 minute walk from the border, people turn up asking for water or a phone, others march straight into homes to raid their kitchens, said Annette Mattia, 61, who lives in the village. Some\u00a0Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0members put out water or food for the migrants, others are afraid to. Some members have been involved in smuggling themselves, she says. \u201cWe\u2019re always calling (Border Patrol) because where we live is a bushy area with the trees still there and everything. And that was like the gateway for smugglers. You can just go walk in our yard and in the little trees, and you\u2019ll find the slipper shoes the smugglers use, or their camouflage clothes,\u201d she says. Still, seeing Border Patrol\u2019s trucks and helicopters on the reservation and frequent questioning by agents also makes many\u00a0of the Nation\u2019s residents\u00a0bristle. \u201cIf you decide to go out into the mountains for the day, if you want to pick the cactus fruit or get materials from the desert, Border Patrol will be out there, and they will be on you: \u2018What are you doing here, why are you out here?\u2019,\u201d Annette Mattia told CNN. \u201cYou know, this is our reservation. It\u2019s our nation. We can go hunting if we want to go hunting, we can gather if we want to gather,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re here because the border\u2019s here.\u201d A deadly landscape Sprawling across 2.8\u00a0million acres, it\u2019s easy to imagine getting lost in this desert reservation. Massive rock formations are the only landmarks, rising between low plains dotted with dry shrubs and cactus forests. Many migrants who cross here never make it out alive; the remains of at least 1,650 people have been found across the Tohono O\u2019odham reservation since 2000, according to local organization Humane Borders, which\u00a0works with the Pima County Medical Examiner\u2019s office to track deaths. Last year, the bodies of 81 people were found on the reservation, according to Humane Borders. So far in 2024, 10 bodies have been found here, according to the Humane Borders map, all discovered on the San Miguel corridor \u2013 the same route where we met dozens of people waiting with children as young as toddlers. Most, but not all, are reduced to skeletons in the arid desert. In May, one unidentified man found close to the border was found \u201cfully fleshed\u201d \u2013 he had\u00a0died from heat exposure within a day of being found, according to the county medical examiner\u2019s report. In February, the body of a 22-year-old woman was found on the Baboquivari Peak\u00a0mountain range; she was the victim of blunt force injuries, the medical examiner assessed. Summer is the deadliest time for border crossings. But while migration through the Sonoran Desert has historically slowed during these searing months, that\u2019s no longer the case today, a CBP spokesperson told CNN; human traffickers who\u2019ve made a business of promising asylum in America now push migrants through the border year-round in order to maximize profits. Demand for traffickers is high, despite the risks \u2013 which migrants may not always understand. Since the pandemic, people fleeing stuttering economies, climate change, crime and authoritarian governments have flocked to the US southern border, a CBP spokesperson told CNN \u2013 nearly all those journeys were facilitated by criminal groups. \u201cNo one crosses on their own anymore,\u201d the spokesperson told CNN. Cartels\u2019 grip on the border area is near-complete, he confirmed; attempting to cross the Mexican side of the desert into the US without paying is another way to end up dead. Migrants sent one way, drugs another Today, faced with vast numbers of asylum seekers in a blistering landscape, the day-to-day work of Border Patrol often ends up being humanitarian. In the Tucson Sector, Border Patrol agents perform dozens of rescues each week, according to statistics posted online by the agency, and frequently end up treating dehydrated or injured migrants in the desert. Even more often, agents simply ferry families from the desolate border where asylum seekers politely wait to be apprehended, to detention centers further inland \u2013 a task that one agent likened with annoyance to babysitting or Uber driving. Some describe with nostalgia a Wild West version of their jobs from decades past, chasing drug runners across a dramatic landscape. \u201cBack in the day when it was just single males with a lot of narcotics, it was dangerous but kind of exciting,\u201d said the agent, who requested anonymity because he did not have permission to speak publicly. \u201cSecure the border. We didn\u2019t have to babysit. We were up in the mountains getting narcotics and stuff, chasing gun traffickers, drugs. But now it\u2019s moms and infants. It sucks. Nobody wants to deal with a mama and baby.\u201d Border Patrol agents and Nation\u00a0members say migrants, on whom so much national attention is focused, are often used as a distraction for law enforcement on the reservation. Cartels funnel large groups toward remote areas that are difficult and time-consuming to reach, in addition to being more dangerous for the travelers, while smugglers trek with drug-loaded backpacks\u00a0up another route. \u201cThe cartels want migrants to cross in rural areas to pull us away, so drugs and stuff can make it through while we\u2019re busy\u2026 You\u2019ve got to drive the freaking 30 or 40 minutes out there, pick them up, drive 30 or 40 minutes back. You ain\u2019t got time to go chase three or four people with backpacks walking through the desert,\u201d the agent told CNN. Urban crossing areas are also often more closely patrolled than the desert wilds and are more likely to be blocked by a towering steel barrier, unlike these lands. Mike Wilson, a Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0member who has gained celebrity in human rights circles for years spent putting out water for migrants on the reservation, says many of the deaths on the reservation were predictable. In a recently published memoir, \u201cWhat Side Are You On?\u201d Wilson blames a US border policy of deterrence \u2013 blocking irregular migration at urban crossing points \u2013 for driving asylum seekers into Tohono O\u2019odham lands and the most perilous parts of the desert. The strategy, which originated in the 1990s, included a calculation that deaths resulting from the dangerous trek would deter future migrants. The number of illegal border crossings has risen since then. Security vs. sovereignty Frustrations over the border here came to a head last year, when Annette\u2019s brother Raymond Mattia was shot and killed by a group of Border Patrol agents at his home. Nothing to do with immigration \u2013 they\u00a0were supposed to be backing up a local Tohono O\u2019odham police unit\u00a0that was looking into a 911 call reporting two gunshots had been heard. Footage from\u00a0the agents\u2019 body cameras\u00a0showed their flashlights casting through the dark of the Arizona desert, choppily illuminating saguaro cacti and low shrubs in the neighborhood in search of movement in the area, before noticing the unarmed 58-year-old \u00a0standing in his front yard. Obeying agents\u2019 orders, he removed his hand from his pocket, withdrawing a cell phone. They began firing immediately. \u201cI thought they were yelling and shouting at illegals,\u201d she recalled, describing their attitude as a \u201chyped up and ready to hunt.\u201d \u201cThey had flashlights going like crazy, shouting, yelling at each other, and I was like, \u2018What the heck is going on?\u2019 Then I realized they were going to Ray\u2019s house.\u201d It is unclear if Raymond Mattia was the person they were looking for; authorities made no allegations following the incident. The US Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona has chosen not to press charges over the killing, prompting the Mattia family to launch a wrongful death lawsuit. But holding border agents to account has been\u00a0increasingly hard to do following\u00a0a 2022 Supreme Court ruling\u00a0that gave federal agents broad legal protection against claims of excessive force. \u201cI know they\u2019re here to protect the border: for the terrorists, the immigrants, the smugglers. But when they\u2019re coming to the reservation to shoot a Native American person who is at home, they should be accountable for that kind of action,\u201d Annette Mattia said. In a statement last year criticizing the US Attorney\u2019s decision not to prosecute, Jose linked Mattia\u2019s death to a larger failing of border management. \u201cThe US government\u2019s refusal to enact sensible border solutions has brought undue hardship to O\u2019odham and other border communities,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile politicians waste time debating walls and other ineffective and divisive ideas, our people are persecuted\u00a0and in this case, killed by federal agents.\u201d The chairman sees the federal approach toward the border as all too focused on maintaining an imaginary line and scoring political points, and expressed frustration\u00a0with the failure of Congress to find a bigger-picture, bipartisan solution\u00a0\u2013 something that in recent weeks has led the Biden administration to rely on executive orders instead. \u201cWhy would we want to protect a border? We want to protect the environment. We want to protect the people. We want to protect the communities around here,\u201d\u00a0Jose said. That\u2019s his mandate from Nation\u00a0elders, he said. What the US should do, he said, is focus on \u201ckicking its drug habit\u201d to shrink demand for smuggled narcotics, and widen sustainable immigration pathways for economic migrants that allow them to come, work and eventually leave. Still, as long as migrants keep coming here, so will Border Patrol \u2013 and the tribal government has been clear that it wants the federal agency to handle the immediate crisis. New buildings designed to serve as sleeping and living quarters for Border Patrol agents are currently being built on the reservation. Standing on the border halfway up a mountain, where the low posts that mark the border stop, and the rocks and dry shrubs flow seamlessly between the US and Mexico, Jose was clear on his own red line: While much is out of the Nation\u2019s\u00a0hands, he will resist any kind of border wall \u2013 a prospect that has haunted the nation since the Trump administration, and which looms again with the former President\u2019s reelection bid. From his view, the very first migrant surge started at Plymouth Rock. \u201cIf ever there was a time to build a wall,\u201d he said, \u201cit would have been 500 years ago.\u201d Edited by CNN\u2019s Rachel Clarke in Atlanta.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/americas/migration-us-mexico-border-tohono-oodham-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_europe_keir-starmer-labour-profile-uk-election-intl-cmd", "text": "As Britain edges closer\u00a0toward\u00a0its general election on July 4, the polls tell the same story they have for\u00a0most\u00a0of the past three years:\u00a0This is a country screaming out for change. The situation has been dire for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak since he took office\u00a0in late\u00a02022.\u00a0His governing Conservative Party \u2013 whose 14 years in power have been defined by the political gambles of austerity, Brexit and radical economics \u2013\u00a0fell behind the opposition Labour Party in the polls around November 2021, and the gap has only widened since. Barring a major shock, Labour leader Keir Starmer will be the person walking through the famous black door of 10 Downing Street\u00a0in less than three weeks\u2019 time. Starmer has promised to be the agent of change that Britain needs. He has pledged to grow the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0economy by reforming planning laws and investing in a new industrial strategy. He\u00a0has said he\u00a0will set up a national wealth fund with \u00a37.3 billion\u00a0($9.3bn)\u00a0of public money that will help pay for the transition to net zero\u00a0emissions. An\u00a0\u00a38.3bn publicly-owned energy company, Great British Energy, will see the\u00a0United Kingdom\u2019s energy grid\u00a0decarbonized\u00a0by 2030. Starmer says all this can be achieved without raising income taxes, though there are no commitments\u00a0on other levies, such as capital gains tax, which is paid on money made from selling assets, including property and shares. The rest of the\u00a0Labour\u00a0manifesto combines a mix of modest centrism mixed with soft socialism.\u00a0It includes imposing\u00a0taxes on private schools to\u00a0help\u00a0pay for state education and windfall\u00a0levies\u00a0on energy companies to fund the transition to clean energy. There are\u00a0also\u00a0commitments on workers\u2019 rights, cutting waiting lists for health care\u00a0and\u00a0also controlling immigration. Critics on the right say that Starmer will need to raise taxes to fund his plans, while\u00a0skeptics\u00a0on the left say his manifesto is not bold or ambitious enough to change Britain for the better. This is a Britain, of course, that has had\u00a0record-high\u00a0inflation over the past two years, watched interest rates\u00a0skyrocket, seen the pound sink to a record low\u00a0against the dollar,\u00a0is still in a\u00a0cost-of-living\u00a0crisis, has had the longest waiting times for\u00a0medical\u00a0operations in recent history and has spent the past eight years in political turmoil following the\u00a02016\u00a0vote to leave the European Union. In short,\u00a0this is\u00a0a long list of things to sort out in a five-year term when public finances are in disarray. The question for Starmer, should he win, is whether the mess is too big for him to fix and whether he has the political skill to bring about the change he has promised. Who is Keir Starmer? On paper,\u00a0the 61-year-old\u00a0Starmer looks like a classic establishment figure. Once a leading human rights lawyer, he became Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 2008, running the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales \u2013\u00a0a high-profile job for which he was knighted, making him the first ever Labour leader to enter the job with the prefix Sir to their name. Starmer, however, is - by the standards of modern political leaders - from relatively humble beginnings. Born in 1962, Starmer grew up in a small town to the south of London. His father was a toolmaker who worked in a factory, his mother was a nurse who suffered with severe physical disabilities, which ultimately led to one of her legs being amputated. While Starmer has never claimed to have suffered poverty, he has talked of financial struggles that affected his family, as well as the learning difficulties that held back his younger brother. Clearly, these early experiences shaped Starmer\u2019s politics. He has talked about noticing people looking down on his father for working in a factory or bullying his brother. His parents were political, naming their\u00a0eldest after the first Labour leader in parliament, Keir Hardie. \u201cHe\u2019s the first Labour leader in a generation to talk about class and snobbery,\u201d\u00a0Tom Baldwin, author of \u201cKeir Starmer: The Biography,\u201d\u00a0told CNN.\u00a0\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make him a class warrior but someone who understands the different layers of pride, aspiration and guilt\u2026 He feels the sting of the disrespect his dad experienced\u2026 He talks a lot about his sister who has led a precarious life as a carer, having not gone to university,\u201d Baldwin added. Starmer chose to study law at the University of Leeds, before completing a postgraduate\u00a0degree\u00a0at the University of Oxford. He initially thought he would have a legal career working for trade unions, but as his politics evolved in line with his studies, he became increasingly interested in human rights. What does he believe? Starmer has been on something of a journey since entering politics. He was elected to Parliament in 2015 at the age of 52 and\u00a0entered\u00a0the shadow cabinet\u00a0a\u00a0little over a year later. Jeremy Corbyn,\u00a0then the Labour leader, made Starmer his Brexit chief following the 2016 referendum. Corbyn is a controversial figure in British politics and serving in his top team is still something that haunts Starmer. Corbyn had historically been\u00a0on\u00a0the far left of the Labour Party. Prior to becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn had at various points in his long career supported nuclear disarmament,\u00a0and\u00a0withdrawal from NATO, and said it was a \u201ctragedy\u201d that Osama bin Laden was killed rather than put on trial. Starmer was in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet\u00a0for\u00a0the 2017 and 2019 general elections \u2013 something the Conservatives bring up regularly as evidence that he is a threat to national security, having tried twice to make Corbyn prime minister. However, Starmer has since kicked Corbyn out of\u00a0the\u00a0Labour Party following an investigation into\u00a0antisemitism\u00a0during Corbyn\u2019s time as leader. Starmer\u00a0has also said\u00a0that he supported Corbyn knowing he would lose. Pressed on that point in a BBC \u201cQuestion Time\u201d program, he said Corbyn \u201cwould be a better prime minister\u201d than \u201cwhat we got\u201d in Boris Johnson. Starmer also argues\u00a0that he\u00a0has brought Labour back to a position of electability. The polls suggest that is true, but critics of Starmer on the left say that he used Corbyn and\u00a0his wing\u00a0of the Labour Party to win the party leadership in 2020 \u2013 committing to\u00a0several\u00a0left-wing positions\u00a0such as\u00a0nationalizing public services, scrapping university tuition fees and reversing\u00a0Conservative welfare reforms \u2013 only to abandon those pledges\u00a0once he got closer to\u00a0power. James Schneider, Corbyn\u2019s former communications chief, told CNN: \u201cStarmer is not a principled man. His campaign to become Labour leader was systemically dishonest. His cynicism and lack of policies to improve people\u2019s lives will lead to a deep disillusionment that could either feed the hard right or a future people\u2019s movement for change.\u201d Starmer has at various times responded to accusations that he has drifted politically by saying that he puts his country before his political party, and that it\u2019s only possible to change things if you are in power. Can Starmer change Britain? Whether you think Starmer\u2019s\u00a0current\u00a0plan is unambitious, dishonest, or exactly what Britain needs, it\u2019s impossible to push through policy without political and personal capital. Dominic Grieve, a Conservative politician who served as\u00a0attorney\u00a0general while Starmer was DPP, speaks glowingly of this period. \u201cHe ran his department very efficiently and effectively at a really difficult time because his budget had been cut. It was genuinely very impressive,\u201d\u00a0Grieve told CNN. Grieve\u00a0added\u00a0that Starmer was able to be an effective manager because \u201che is not bogged down with years of political ideology or baggage. He can see what is wrong and can address it.\u201d Much as Starmer\u2019s allies might see this as a strength, his opponents, from both sides of politics,\u00a0see it as a weakness. To those on the right, Starmer is a man who will say anything to get in power. He is someone who\u00a0in their eyes\u00a0will support\u00a0Corbyn,\u00a0who is anti-NATO and has repeatedly been accused of being a terrorist\u00a0sympathizer,\u00a0to get what he wants and is a danger to Britain. To the left, he is someone who doesn\u2019t have the conviction\u00a0to make radical changes\u00a0and, once in office,\u00a0will not be materially that different to a Conservative leader. If current polling is accurate, Starmer will\u00a0win\u00a0a historic and enormous majority in the\u00a0House of Commons. But\u00a0the future may not be so simple.\u00a0Given\u00a0the current state of Britain\u2019s finances, the circumstances of\u00a0Labour\u2019s probable\u00a0victory and, even Starmer\u2019s own personality traits, it\u00a0might mean he doesn\u2019t have quite the blank check\u00a0that a leader with virtually no opposition\u00a0in parliament\u00a0would typically enjoy. An\u00a0inability to turn that parliamentary power into tangible results\u00a0at a time when voters are crying out for something different\u00a0could mean that five years from now, his moderate, safety-first center-left program may ultimately be\u00a0seen as\u00a0just as big a political gamble as any of those the Conservatives took in the\u00a0past 14 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/europe/keir-starmer-labour-profile-uk-election-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_europe_analysis-putin-north-korea-visit-intl", "text": "Vladmir Putin\u2019s first visit to North Korea in nearly a quarter of a century\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0intensely scrutinized around the world. Russia\u00a0knew\u00a0the West\u00a0was\u00a0watching and the optics were not subtle. Putin has been left out of many global gatherings of late, and risks arrest in much of the world thanks to a\u00a0warrant from the International Criminal Court over his invasion of Ukraine. But on Wednesday, the increasingly isolated Russian president was met with a rapturous welcome in Pyongyang. Children waved Russian flags as Putin\u2019s giant picture adorned one side of Kim Il Sung square, while footage broadcast on Russian state media showed posters of the Kremlin leader lining the streets. All of it was a signal to the world that not only is Putin is not isolated, his patronage is still prized in some parts of the globe. And here, unlike in China, no one could accuse him of being the junior partner. Neither the rhetoric of the two leaders, nor the so-called \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership pact\u201d\u00a0they signed,\u00a0left any doubt that the overarching goal was to band together against what Putin described as \u201cthe imperialist policy of the United States and its satellites.\u201d The pact contains a clause similar to NATO\u2019s\u00a0Article V, providing, according to Putin, \u201cfor the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this agreement.\u201d According to the text of the pact, which was published on Thursday by North Korean state media, Article 4 states that should either country \u201cget into a state of war due to an armed aggression\u201d the other \u201cshall immediately provide military and other assistance with all the means at its disposal.\u201d Putin went on to accuse the West of violating its \u201cinternational responsibilities\u201d by delivering F-16s and other weapons to Ukraine, adding Russia therefore \u201cdoes not rule out the development of military-technical co-operation with the DPRK in accordance with the document signed today.\u201d In other words, the two are promising to militarily help each other at a time of escalating face-offs with their neighbors and the West.\u00a0And\u00a0this raises major questions. If this is a collective defense pact, does Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent now extend to North Korea\u2019s and vice versa?\u00a0Will that \u201cmilitary-technical cooperation\u201d include holding joint military drills and establishing joint forces to protect their borders?\u00a0Who else could join this pact in the future? \u201cIn a sense this is laying out what they have been already building up in the recent months and years,\u201d said Jo Bee-yun, Associate Research Fellow at Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. \u201cBut definitely I would say this clause is very alarming.\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019s at the initial stage, depending on how things roll out, they would, if I were them, they would interpret the clause according to their needs.\u201d And there\u2019s the more immediate concern that the \u201cmilitary-technical cooperation\u201d could mean more shells and missiles making their way from North Korean factories to the front lines in Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied this is happening, and yet Russia, having once backed UN sanctions that explicitly prevent North Korea from exporting weapons, used this opportunity to again denounce \u201cpolitically motivated sanction.\u201d Back in March, Russia had already used its position on the UN security council to end the mandate of a panel monitoring North Korean sanctions violations. Russian state media did not miss the opportunity to needle the West.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe West admits terrible concern around Putin\u2019s visit to North Korea\u201d\u00a0read\u00a0the headline in Moskovsky Komsomolets, a\u00a0national\u00a0daily newspaper Tuesday.\u00a0 \u201cWhat difference does it make to the Americans if we talk to our neighbor\u00a0[North Korea], why are you getting so worked up?\u201d taunted top Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov on his Tuesday night talk show, before adding, less reassuringly, \u201cwe are already living in a\u00a0Third World War\u201d. That comment perhaps speaks to another part of Moscow\u2019s strategy:\u00a0Russia may now have calculated that its own nuclear saber-rattling is no\u00a0longer\u00a0enough to prevent the West from stepping up aid to Ukraine. The meeting with Kim Jong UN, and this \u201cbreakthrough\u201d pact, come at the same time as long-awaited US weapons are starting to flow to Ukraine, and some restrictions are being lifted on using them to hit Russia. Russia also needs weapons to keep up its strategy of exhausting and destroying Ukraine into surrender. So while it still may not be in Russia\u2019s strategic interest to provide explicit funding or technology to expand the nuclear arsenal of its unpredictable neighbor \u2013 and risk upsetting China \u2013 it may at least want the West to believe it\u2019s willing to do it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/europe/analysis-putin-north-korea-visit-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

The officer was arrested on Monday \u201con suspicion of misconduct in public office,\u201d a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said Wednesday. \u201cWe can confirm that on Friday, June 14, the Met were contacted by the Gambling Commission who informed us that they were investigating alleged bets made by a police constable from the Met\u2019s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, which were related to the timing of the General Election,\u201d the spokesperson added. The constable\u00a0was removed from his operational duties and the matter was immediately referred to the Met\u2019s Directorate of Professional Standards, which opened an investigation, the spokesperson said. The arrest comes days after the Guardian newspaper reported that a close aide of Sunak made a \u00a3100 ($127) bet\u00a0on a July election date before the prime minister had publicly announced the date.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday afternoon shortly before the police released their statement,\u00a0Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party posted a\u00a0campaign ad on social media\u00a0that said, \u201cIf you bet on Labour, you can never win,\u201d alongside a video of a roulette wheel.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said.

{"id": "2024_06_21_weather_heat-wave-new-york-i-95-corridor-new-mexico-wildfires", "text": "Extreme summer weather continues to impact much of the US on Friday and into the weekend with a dangerous heat wave ratcheting up in New York and the I-95 corridor, deadly and destructive wildfires still burning in New Mexico and potential tropical threats. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022 Heat escalates this weekend: More than 100 million Americans, including those in the  highly populated I-95 corridor, are under heat alerts through the weekend. A heat emergency was in effect for Washington, DC, where upper 90s and even triple-digit temperatures for the first time since 2016 will be possible. \u2022 Search for \u201cmore loss of life\u201d in New Mexico fires:\u00a0In New Mexico, authorities reported\u00a0that at least two people\u00a0died, 1,400 structures were destroyed and and more than 8,000 residents were evacuated as a result of\u00a0wildfires. The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso, New Mexico, said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for \u201cmore loss of life.\u201d The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. \u2022 Flood threat in fire zone: A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning. More rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods. \u2022 Tropical threats brewing: The National Hurricane Center\u00a0is monitoring two areas with a medium chance of tropical development in the next 48 hours. One could become a tropical depression off the North Florida and Georgia coasts Friday. The other could take a nearly identical track to Tropical Storm Alberto. \u2022 FBI investigating origins of New Mexico fires: FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires in New Mexico, the agency said Thursday. \u201cI can confirm that the FBI is assisting our local, state, federal and tribal partners in the ongoing investigation of the fires in Ruidoso NM,\u201d said a spokesperson with the bureau\u2019s Albuquerque field office. President Joe Biden is \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d wildfires in New Mexico, the White House said Thursday. The administration has also approved an expedited major disaster declaration from New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, \u201cunlocking further federal support and FEMA assistance to the impacted communities.\u201d \u2022 California firefighters brace for 100-degree heat: California is heating up Friday, with triple-digit temperatures expected in some areas. Heat alerts span parts of southern and central California, including in Colusa County, where firefighters are working to rein in the Sites Fire spanning over 19,100 acres. High temperatures between 100 and 106 are expected and could hinder firefighting efforts. California is seeing an active early fire year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Since the start of the year, 89,784 acres have burned, compared to 5,747 acres during the same period last year. Early-season heat wave intensifies this weekend More record daily high temperatures are possible through the weekend as heat expands into new areas and intensifies in others. A stagnant heat dome over the eastern US is fueling some of the most unusually intense heat over portions of the Ohio Valley and the mid-Atlantic. Heat will build in Washington, DC, Friday and threaten triple-digits Saturday and Sunday. The extreme heat and humidity will combine to push the heat index \u2013 or how hot it feels \u2013 to 100 to 105 degrees over a widespread area, with 110 degrees possible in the southern mid-Atlantic. Record overnight low temperatures will increase health risks by reducing the ability for people to cool down at night. The heat wave\u2019s prolonged nature is another serious concern. New York City could experience 90-degree temperatures or higher for seven days straight into week. The  stretch would be the longest ever in June in the city. Heat is also returning in full force in the West following a brief break. Heat alerts are already in place for portions of California, Arizona and Utah. Temperatures are expected to jump back up to 10 to 15 degrees above normal for Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Bakersfield, California, through the weekend. Hurricane season heating up, too Two tropical systems could develop quick on the heels of Alberto. The first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season made landfall as sprawling tropical storm in Mexico, but brought heavy rain and storm surge to much of the western Gulf of Mexico. A system with a medium chance of tropical development could mimic Alberto\u2019s track through the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and into northeastern Mexico this weekend. A broad area of low pressure near the Yucatan Peninsula is forecast to strengthen as it moves into the southwest Gulf of Mexico this weekend. This system has a medium chance of developing into a tropical system. in the next several days and will also bring more rain chances to South Texas. While this system is not expected to be as large as Alberto, it would bring more rain chances to South Texas and trigger new flooding concerns there and along the Gulf Coast. Texas isn\u2019t the only area watching for a potential tropical system. Those in Florida and Georgia should also watch closely as a tropical depression could develop Friday with little time before it makes landfall Friday night. The National Hurricane Center on Friday morning increased the odds of the storm system developing after finding signs it was organizing. It has a medium chance of a last-gasp development, according to the NHC. The designation would largely be ceremonial as some heavy rain, high surf and gusty winds are expected regardless of the system\u2019s final form.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/weather/heat-wave-new-york-i-95-corridor-new-mexico-wildfires/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_22_middleeast_israel-gaza-central-strikes-dozens-killed-intl", "text": "Fifty-two people have been killed or left missing in Israeli strikes near Gaza city on Saturday, according to the Hamas-controlled Government Media Office (GMO). The GMO said that 38 bodies had arrived at Al Ahli Baptist Hospital and 14 people are still missing under the rubble of homes and buildings. Video from two of the areas targeted shows extensive destruction and multiple casualties after large explosions. The Civil Defense Directorate said that a number of people remained under the rubble after Israeli aircraft targeted a house near the Batsh cemetery in the Al Tuffah neighborhood, which is east of Gaza City. Another strike was reported against a residential block in Al Shati, another neighborhood near Gaza City. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), in a brief statement Saturday, said that IDF fighter jets had struck \u201cHamas military infrastructure\u201d sites in the area of Gaza City. The IDF did not specify where the strikes had taken place. CNN is seeking more details. A medical rescue worker in the area told CNN that the\u00a0airstrike at Al Shati camp felt like an \u201cearthquake.\u201d \u201cThere has been a targeting of Al Shati camp near Al Sousi Mosque, which was like an earthquake hitting a whole residential block. \u201cThere are entire families under the destroyed houses.\u201d Local resident Abu Mahmoud Al-Karir said: \u201cJust a while ago, people were acting normally, some were buying goods, others were at home. \u201cThen the occupation\u2019s planes came and bombed this residential block. As you can see, an entire block has been obliterated. Tall buildings were leveled to the ground, now buried under the earth.\u201d It comes after the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said at least 22 people were killed in a strike that hit civilians sheltering in\u00a0southern Gaza\u00a0on Friday. The strike hit the tents of displaced people in the Palestinian town of Mawasi, parts of which have been identified by the Israeli military as a humanitarian zone. The ICRC said Friday that its office adjacent to the humanitarian area in Mawasi\u00a0was damaged by nearby shelling. It did not attribute blame for the shelling, but said that \u201cfiring so dangerously close to humanitarian structures puts the lives of civilians and humanitarians at risk.\u201d It said \u201cheavy-caliber projectiles\u201d had landed within meters of the facility and the nearby Red Cross field hospital had received 22 bodies and 45 injured. The IDF said Saturday\u00a0that it was examining the incident. \u201cFollowing an initial inquiry, there was no direct attack carried out by the IDF against a Red Cross facility. The incident will be quickly examined and its findings will be presented to our international partners.\u201d Israel has been intensifying its operation in nearby Rafah, where it launched an offensive last month as part of its campaign to dismantle Hamas in Gaza. A Gazan official said Israel\u2019s military was pushing deeper into Rafah and was nearing the coast. The total number of deaths in the Gaza Strip since October 7 now stands at 37,551, with 85,911 injuries, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, which killed around 1,200 people. Israel drops hostage flyers Also on Saturday, the Israeli military dropped at least two different leaflets with the names and photos of hostages over various locations in the Gaza Strip. Leaflets were dropped in the Al-Zeitoun and Al-Sabra neighborhoods of Gaza City as well as in the city of Khan Younis in the south of the Strip, according to Palestinians in Gaza who spoke about the flyers on social media. The Israeli military said flyers had been dropped \u201cthroughout the Gaza Strip.\u201d \u201cLook around you carefully\u2026 the hostages may be next to you,\u201d the flyers read in Arabic. \u201cIf you want to preserve your families, do not hesitate to provide us with any information regarding the hostages or their kidnappers,\u201d they add. The flyers dropped in Gaza City were different from those dropped in Khan Younis, displaying different hostages. In total, 62 hostages were shown on the flyers. CNN identified the photographs of six hostages who had previously been declared dead by Israel on the flyers. Four were kidnapped in Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. CNN identified the other two hostages as Israeli soldiers who were kidnapped prior to the October 7 attack. They are believed to be deceased. It\u2019s unclear why photos of hostages who are believed to be dead are included among the images on the leaflets. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The IDF said Saturday it had dropped flyers \u201cthroughout the Gaza Strip as part of the ongoing intelligence efforts to return the hostages.\u201d An Israeli security official told CNN that the families of the hostages listed on the flyers had been notified in advance of Saturday\u2019s drop. The official said the \u201cselection of the photos stems from various considerations that cannot be detailed.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.

{"id": "2024_06_22_middleeast_medics-pilgrimage-hajj-eyewitnesses-intl", "text": "There were not enough medics or basic facilities to protect Hajj pilgrims from the effects of the sweltering heat in Saudi Arabia last week, two pilgrims recently returned from Hajj told CNN, as the official death toll from this year\u2019s Hajj pilgrimage soared to almost 500. Witnesses said worshipers losing consciousness and walking past bodies covered in white cloth became a norm during the mass religious event. This years\u2019 Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca has been held amid extreme weather conditions which saw temperatures consistently soar above average figures. The exact death toll remains unclear and is expected to rise much further, as each country has been independently announcing the deaths of their nationals. Additionally, the governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota \u2013 more deaths are feared among unregistered pilgrims. Zirrar Ali, 40, who returned to London on Friday from his pilgrimage with his 70-year-old father, told CNN that authorities did not provide enough water, shade or medical support to Hajj pilgrims during the week he was there. \u201cTo me, it felt like there are too many people, there are not enough medics, so they are just waiting for the worst of the worst to happen and then they will step in,\u201d Ali said, adding that people passing out came to be a regularity. \u201cI couldn\u2019t focus on my Hajj when I saw these people suffering,\u201d he added. Ali\u2019s comments were echoed by another witness, 44-year-old Ahmad from Indonesia, who told CNN he saw many people falling ill and even dying from the heat. \u201cAlong the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom [white fabric] cloth,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time there is a distribution of water from local residents or certain groups, it is immediately overrun by the pilgrims,\u201d he added, saying that he didn\u2019t see health workers or a single ambulance along the road. Both pilgrims lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of this year\u2019s pilgrimage, especially for those who travelled independently, outside of licensed tour groups. Saudi Arabia requires each pilgrim to acquire one of the 1.8 million available licenses to legally access Mecca. These licenses can cost several thousand US dollars. Unlicensed pilgrims typically don\u2019t travel in organized tour buses with air conditioning or easy access to water and food supplies. Despite the luxuries on offer to some, all pilgrims spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in the scorching heat. According to Ali, five hours walking every day is the minimum, but many pilgrims spent 12 hours outside per day. For him, although the long walk is a fundamental part of the Hajj experience, he believes the Saudi government should have provided more assistance. \u201cTaking eight hours to get from A to B, that\u2019s part of being patient and that\u2019s considered hardship\u2026but at no point were we told \u2018if you don\u2019t have water for ten hours, that\u2019s considered part of Hajj\u2019 it\u2019s not considered to be part of Hajj, we should be giving comfort and taking care of ourselves,\u201d he said. The\u00a0daughter of an elderly\u00a0Indonesian man who died during Hajj told CNN her family was \u201chappy\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0was\u00a0buried\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Islamic holy city of\u00a0Mecca\u00a0after\u00a0he\u00a0had waited for\u00a0years to go on the\u00a0pilgrimage. Speaking to CNN on Sunday,\u00a0Heru Jumartiyah said\u00a0her 86-year-old father Ngatijo Wongso Sentono registered for Hajj pilgrimage\u00a0in\u00a02018 and travelled to\u00a0Mecca\u00a0with his 83-year-old wife and neighbors from the\u00a0Indonesian city of Yogyakarta. \u201cMy father was very enthusiastic about going on the\u00a0Hajj.\u00a0He\u00a0wanted to leave immediately,\u201d she\u00a0told CNN. According to Islamic belief, to die and be\u00a0buried\u00a0in\u00a0Mecca\u00a0is considered to be a blessing, with many Muslims travelling\u00a0in\u00a0their old age after having saved for the\u00a0pilgrimage. CNN has reached out to Saudi authorities regarding the reportedly inadequate response to this year\u2019s heat and has yet to hear back. More than\u00a01.8 million people\u00a0took part in this year\u2019s Hajj, one of the world\u2019s largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year\u2019s gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom. It occurs two months and 10 days after Ramadan ends, during the Islamic month of Dhul-Hijjah. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and shorter than the Gregorian calendar, the timing of Hajj on the Gregorian calendar shifts slightly each year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/middleeast/medics-pilgrimage-hajj-eyewitnesses-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_vietnam-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi on Wednesday, fresh from a rare meeting in North Korea\u00a0with counterpart Kim Jong Un in which the two leaders agreed a new strategic partnership driven by Moscow\u2019s need for weapons for its war in Ukraine. Considered a pariah by the West, Putin is looking to boost economic ties with friendly countries and show that Western isolation is not having an impact. Communist-run Vietnam appears to be a natural choice with its foreign policy of non-alignment and close historical ties to Moscow, and few countries can successfully host the leaders of the United States, China and Russia with such fanfare as Vietnam. Putin\u2019s two-day visit to Vietnam has rankled the United States, with a State Department spokesperson saying, \u201cno country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression and otherwise allow him to normalize his atrocities.\u201d \u201cIf he is able to travel freely, it could normalize Russia\u2019s blatant violations of international law and inadvertently send the message that atrocities can be committed in Ukraine and elsewhere with impunity,\u201d the spokesperson added. The Russian leader met with Vietnamese leadership including Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and new President To Lam, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS, citing the Kremlin. Putin told Lam on Thursday that \u201cstrengthening a comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam is always one of our priorities,\u201d TASS reported. At the start of his talks with Lam, Putin invited him to Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next year. \u201cWe will be glad to welcome you to the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War in Moscow,\u201d TASS quoted Putin as saying. Much like his visit to Pyongyang, Putin\u2019s trip to Hanoi could signal deepening relations between the two nations as the Russian leader looks to garner concrete support amid international sanctions over his grinding war in Ukraine. Ahead of the visit, Putin\u00a0thanked Vietnam for its \u201cbalanced position\u201d on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in an article for the Vietnamese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, according to the Kremlin. \u201cWe are grateful to our Vietnamese friends for their balanced position on the Ukraine crisis and their desire to facilitate the search for practical ways to settle it peacefully. All of this is fully in line with the spirit and nature of our relations,\u201d\u00a0Putin\u00a0said. Vietnam\u2019s Ambassador to Russia Dang Minh Koi told the Vietnam News Agency that the state visit will strengthen Hanoi-Moscow ties, and be \u201can opportunity for the leaders of the two countries to discuss and propose concrete measures to boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation,\u201d TASS reported. A joint statement is expected to be adopted and numerous agreements announced on cooperation in sectors including \u201ctrade and economic, scientific, technological and humanitarian areas,\u201d according to Russian presidential foreign policy aide Yury\u00a0Ushakov, TASS reported. Vietnam\u2019s balancing act Moscow has been a major supplier of weapons to Vietnam since the Soviet era and analysts say arms and energy talks could feature on the agenda. The visit also showcases Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy balancing act, which like India, enables the\u00a0country to be on friendly terms with rival major powers including Russia, the United States and China \u2013 all vital trading partners. Last year, Vietnam hosted both Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden. That trip resulted in the US and Vietnam upgrading diplomatic ties to a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership,\u201d in a historic sign of improving relations between the former foes. The two nations have accelerated trade in recent years and the US is currently reviewing an upgrade to Vietnam\u2019s market economy status that would allow Hanoi to benefit from lower tariffs on goods imported into the US. Vietnam is center to US efforts to counter rising Chinese influence in the region and a key part of Washington\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy. Vietnam in turn is keen to benefit from American efforts to diversify supply chains outside of China as well as US concern over China\u2019s military build-up in the South China Sea. The two countries have built up their partnership just decades after fighting a devastating\u00a0war that decimated the country. \u201cFrom the Vietnamese perspective, Russia is still seen as an important partner with deep historical ties and important roles to play in Vietnam\u2019s defense and security policy,\u201d said Le Hong Hiep, senior fellow of the Vietnam Studies Program at\u00a0Singapore\u2019s ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute. But he said, \u201cVietnam is also careful not to be seen as being too close to Russia\u2026 The US and its allies play a much more significant role in Vietnam\u2019s security and economic development.\u201d While Vietnam may risk disappointing the US and its allies by hosting Putin, \u201cthe country is showing its partners that Vietnam will not sacrifice its ties with one power just to meet the expectations of others,\u201d said Le.\u00a0\u201cIt is not about taking sides. It\u2019s about maintaining its foreign policy of diversification and pursuing a strategy of autonomy.\u201d Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Vietnam and Russia are not members of the ICC. Putin\u2019s push for a new world order Vietnam was among several Southeast Asian countries that abstained from joining a global summit on Ukraine in Switzerland last week. But Western hopes of an isolated Russia appear to not be bearing out as Putin ramps up his outreach to friendly countries and efforts to establish a new global order in opposition to the West. In May, Putin met Xi in Beijing \u2013 his symbolic first overseas trip since starting a\u00a0new term as Russia\u2019s president \u2013 where the two leaders vowed to deepen their strategic partnership in opposition to the US. Now, Putin is visiting two of China\u2019s neighbors in what US national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday called a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d following the leader\u2019s re-election. Crucially, Moscow assumed the rotating presidency of the China and Russia-backed\u00a0BRICS economic group this year and will welcome member and observer nations to its southwestern city of Kazan in October. More than three dozen countries are seeking entry into the bloc and Russia will be the first member to oversee the body since it significantly\u00a0expanded its global footprint\u00a0at the start of the year, when Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Egypt formally joined. For Moscow and Beijing, the expansion is widely viewed as a drive to forge a new world order by turning the loose economic grouping into a geopolitical counterweight to the West \u2013 and Western institutions dominated by the US, such as the G7. Malaysia is the latest country preparing to join the group, according to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, as reported in Chinese media on Tuesday. Vietnam\u00a0has expressed interest in BRICS, with a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman saying in May \u201cwe pay attention to the process of the BRICS membership expansion,\u201d according to Vietnamese state media. Last week, Vietnam sent a delegation led by its Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs to attend the BRICS Foreign Ministers\u2019 Summit in Russia. Analysts say Russia is likely to get more out of the visit than Vietnam, and Hanoi may even suffer reputational damage by hosting Putin following his trip to North Korea. \u201cIf no substantive deals are made, the visit will mainly be symbolic and a means for Putin and Russia to show the world that Western sanctions against Russia are not working,\u201d said Le. \u201cThat symbolism is very important to Putin.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/asia/vietnam-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_china_china-taiwan-quarantine-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China\u2019s military could isolate Taiwan, cripple its economy, and make the democratic island succumb to the will of Beijing\u2019s ruling Communist Party without ever firing a shot, a prominent think tank warns. Fears the Communist Party might make good on its promise to one day take control of Taiwan, by force if necessary, have been heightened in recent years by Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s increasingly bellicose actions towards the self-ruled island. China\u2019s refusal\u00a0to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has only added to those fears. In such a scenario, analysts and military strategists have long focused on two key options available to China \u2013 a full-scale invasion or a military blockade. But a Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), warns there is a third way, one that will make it far harder for the United States and other like-minded democracies to counter: Quarantine. Using \u201cgray zone\u201d tactics \u2013 actions just below what might be considered acts of war \u2013 the China Coast Guard, its so-called maritime militia and various police and maritime safety agencies could initiate a full or partial quarantine of Taiwan, possibly cutting off access to its ports and stopping vital supplies like energy from reaching the island\u2019s 23 million people, a newly released report from CSIS says. The naval, air and ground components of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the world\u2019s largest military force, might play only auxiliary and support roles, authors Bonny Lin, Brian Hart, Matthew Funaiole, Samantha Lu and Truly Tinsley write. \u201cChina has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan in recent years, stoking fears that tensions could erupt into outright conflict. Much attention has been paid to the threat of an invasion, but Beijing has options besides invading to coerce, punish, or annex Taiwan,\u201d the report says. At the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore earlier this month, Chinese Defense Minister Adm. Dong Jun warned those who support any moves for Taiwan independence will \u201cend up in self-destruction.\u201d \u201cWe will take resolute actions to curb Taiwan independence and make sure such a plot never succeeds,\u201d said Dong, speaking through a translator, while slamming \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan. China\u2019s escalating gray zone tactics were on stark display this week as China Coast Guard vessels clashed with Philippine Navy boats in the South China Sea. Videos showed Beijing\u2019s troops threatening Filipinos with an axe and other bladed weapons, and Manila said one of its soldiers lost a thumb in a Chinese-instigated collision. The level of violence was a major step up from previous clashes near Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippines maintains an outpost on a beached warship in waters claimed by both Beijing and Manila. Similarly, Beijing\u2019s military and economic intimidation of Taiwan, a highly developed free-market economy, has grown much more pronounced under Xi. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims the island as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to \u201creunify\u201d with it, by force if necessary. But the CSIS report says Beijing has strong options that could not only keep the PLA out of the fight but could actually put the island democracy or its supporters like the United States in the role of initiators of military conflict to preserve Taiwan\u2019s autonomy. The report notes that the China Coast Guard \u2013 like most coast guards around the world \u2013 is considered a law-enforcement agency. This means it can stop and regulate shipping around the island in what is termed a quarantine, which differs from a blockade. \u201cA quarantine (is) a law enforcement\u2013led operation to control maritime or air traffic within a specific area while a blockade is foremost military in nature,\u201d the report says. International law considers a blockade an act of war, experts say. \u201cA quarantine led by China\u2019s coast guard is not a declaration of war against Taiwan,\u201d the report says, and would put the US in a difficult position, its authors warn. Washington is legally required \u2013 under the Taiwan Relations Act \u2013 to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and it supplies it with defensive weaponry. US President Joe Biden has gone further than the legal requirement, saying repeatedly he would use American troops to protect Taiwan, a warning that appeared to deviate from Washington\u2019s previous stance of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d and one that the White House officials have walked back. But if US military ships or aircraft intervened in what China says is a law enforcement operation, the US could be seen as initiating military hostilities. The report puts the China Coast Guard numbers at 150 ocean-going vessels and 400 smaller ones, like the PLA Navy, the world\u2019s largest force in terms of fleet size. Beijing has hundreds of more vessels in its Maritime Safety Agency and maritime militia, fishing boats integrated into China\u2019s military and law enforcement services. Taiwan\u2019s coast guard, with only 10 ocean-going ships and about 160 smaller ones, lacks the numbers to push back a quarantine effort, the report says. The CSIS authors note that quarantine actions taken by Beijing could be extremely limited and still have the effect of strangling Taiwan economically. Few operators would want to face the possibility of having their assets seized by Chinese authorities and might voluntarily stop servicing the island. \u201cDemonstrated Chinese willingness to search and seize only a handful of commercial ships could have an outsized deterrent impact and discourage similar transgressions,\u201d the report states. Limited search and/or seizure actions have an effect on flights to Taiwan as a quarantine can easily be extended to the air, the report states. Only a handful of flights would need to be warned off by Chinese aircraft to have a stifling effect on all traffic, according to the report. China regularly flies military aircraft around the island, sometimes dozens in a day. In the 24  hours ending at 6 a.m. Friday, 36 Chinese military aircraft crossed into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone, Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry says. Meanwhile, a quarantine, rather than a blockade, would not require China to close or restrict access to the Taiwan Strait, the CSIS report notes. That means Washington and its allies could lose one of their biggest claims to intervene under international law, preserving freedom of navigation in an international waterway. \u201cIf the quarantine is cast as a law enforcement operation, China can easily announce the end of the operation and claim its objectives were met,\u201d the report says. To keep things even more low-key, China might not even need to use the word \u201cquarantine\u201d to begin an operation to isolate Taiwan, the authors say. Under its claims that Taiwan is Chinese territory, Beijing could require customs declarations to be filed before vessels can call in Taiwan. For those that fail to comply, enforcement mechanisms could have a chilling effect on all shipping. \u201cChinese law enforcement vessels will be authorized to board vessels, conduct on-site inspections, question personnel, and undertake other measures against noncompliant ships,\u201d the report said. This idea allows a limited scope of operations for China. For instance, it could just target the island\u2019s busiest port, Kaohsiung, responsible for 57% of Taiwan\u2019s maritime imports and most of its energy imports, according to the study. Plausible, but still fraught with risk for China Outside analysts who reviewed the CSIS report and spoke to CNN found it plausible. But they also harbored important doubts about how things might play out. Some mentioned how the economics don\u2019t necessarily play in Beijing\u2019s favor. \u201cMaintaining the quarantine will be expensive and time consuming,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. \u201cTaipei won\u2019t give up in under 60 days,\u201d Schuster contends. \u201cCan Beijing sustain the effort and possible international reaction for that long?\u201d Efforts to upset the status quo across the Taiwan Strait could further erode Beijing\u2019s foreign trade, the experts warn. Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King\u2019s College in London, notes the challenges the Chinese Communist Party is already facing with an economy still struggling to recover from Covid-19 isolation that has seen growth rates plummet and new trade restrictions, like tariffs on its electric vehicle exports. Taiwan is a prominent industrialized economy, a crucial node in global supply chains\u00a0and a manufacturer of the vast majority of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors. A quarantine on the island would have economic repercussions not just domestically, but globally. While most nations diplomatically recognize Beijing over Taiwan, the island has forged increasingly strong unofficial relations with major western democracies, deepening those ties in recent years as Beijing\u2019s threats have hardened. Taiwan and China are also deeply economically intertwined. Last year, 35% of the island\u2019s exports went to the Chinese mainland, most of which were integrated circuits, solar cells and electronic components, according to Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Economic Affairs. Imports from the mainland accounted for 20% of the island\u2019s total imports in the same year. Between 1991 and 2022, Taiwanese companies invested a total of $203 billion in the mainland, according to Taiwan government statistics, creating millions of jobs in China. Additionally, quarantines can push populations to rally with the government, rather than rise up against it, says Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cHistorical evidence shows that even severe blockades have limited coercive value, and a limited quarantine might result in a rally around the flag effect,\u201d he says. A quarantine could also push Taiwan\u2019s government to declare independence, something Beijing has repeatedly said would likely bring armed conflict, Kaushal warns. \u201cThis would then leave the (Communist Party) with the options of either escalation or a major setback,\u201d he says. Patalano says for China, patience is the key to realizing its goal of \u201creunification.\u201d Escalation, and certainly invasion, is not \u201ccost-efficient,\u201d he says. War costs not only lives but national wealth.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/china/china-taiwan-quarantine-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_europe_russia-dagestan-attacks-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Russia is reeling from another major terror attack, with at least 19 people killed and 25 injured in what appeared to be coordinated shootings at various places of worship in Russia\u2019s southernmost Dagestan republic. The attack is the second in the last three months after more than 130 people were killed at a concert hall near Moscow in a terrorist attack claimed by ISIS-K in March, and challenges President Vladimir Putin\u2019s self-declared reputation as a leader able to guarantee order across the vast, turbulent country. The uptick in violence comes as long-simmering ethnic tensions resurface, compounded both by drives to fill Russia\u2019s military ranks as Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine grinds on \u2013 and by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What happened in Dagestan? Gunmen opened fire at multiple places of worship and a police traffic stop in two cities in Muslim majority Dagestan, killing at least 15 police officers and four civilians including a priest on Sunday. Two synagogues\u00a0\u2013 one in the city of Derbent and one in the city of Makhachkala \u2013 were attacked, according to a statement from the Russian Jewish Congress (RJC). Attackers \u201cset the building on fire using Molotov cocktails\u201d at the synagogue in Derbent while police and security guards were killed outside during the attack, the RJC. In the provincial capital Makhachkala, Russian state-news agency TASS reported that a church security guard was killed in a shootout at Svyato-Uspenskiy Sobor, and 19 people had locked themselves inside the premises amid an attack.\u00a0 An attack was also reported at a police traffic post in Makhachkala. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but law enforcement agencies told TASS that the attackers were \u201cadherents of an international terrorist organization.\u201d The Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the Republic of Dagestan said it had launched a terror investigation into the attacks under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. TASS reported Monday that five of the gunmen had been identified and that some of them were related to the leader of the Sergokalinsky district, which lies between Derbent and Makhachkala. It identified one of the men as former mixed martial arts fighter Gadzhimurad Kagirov. Kagirov had taken part in the attack on Derbent and was also a cousin of the head of the Sergokalinsky district, Magomed Omarov, it claimed. Omarov\u2019s son and nephew were also among the attackers, authorities alleged. Where is Dagestan? Dagestan lies in Russia\u2019s Caucasus region on the western shores of the Caspian Sea. The republic is in many ways a microcosm of Russia\u2019s diversity. The mountainous region is home to over 30 ethnic groups with distinct languages and it is a\u00a0majority Muslim\u00a0republic\u00a0that has historically been home to a variety of Islamic religious practices. It has a miniscule Jewish population \u2013 Judaism is one of Dagestan\u2019s long-established religions, practiced by\u00a0communities of the Mountain Jews, who speak a form of Persian \u2013 but after centuries of coexistence with Muslim neighbors, that population has\u00a0dwindled through emigration. The Caucasus were mostly subsumed into the Russian empire in the nineteenth century had a long history of resentment towards rule by Moscow, during Tsarist, Soviet and post-Soviet times. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, insurgents in neighboring Chechnya fought two separatist wars for independence \u2013 which Russia labeled terrorism and responded with tactics that left much of the capital Grozny in ruins. Putin then installed feared warlord Ramzan Kadyrov in Chechnya who has since ruled with an iron fist. In Dagestan, Russian security forces fought an\u00a0Islamist insurgency\u00a0in the mountainous region in the 2000s that spilled over from neighboring Chechnya, though attacks have become rarer in recent years. But contemporary events have put the historically restless region once more on edge. Religious and ethnic tensions in Russia Over 200 ethnic minority communities live in Russia, which spans eleven time zones and is home to some 144 million people. Some of these communities have been hit especially hard by Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine with ethnic minorities disproportionately mobilized to face the horror of Moscow\u2019s human wave tactics. Protests broke out in multiple ethnic minority regions in 2022 against Putin\u2019s mobilization orders, including in Dagestan. In one video CNN geolocated from the time, women in the capital Makhachkala could be seen pleading with police outside a theater. \u201cWhy are you taking our children? Who attacked who? It\u2019s Russia that attacked Ukraine,\u201d they could be heard saying in the video. Israel\u2019s war against Hamas following the brutal October 7 attacks has also sent tensions soaring across the world, fueled by daily images of the destruction in Gaza, including in the Caucasus. Putin has played a delicate international balancing act, putting himself forward as a potential mediator and calling for restraint on both sides \u2013 a position that has\u00a0won praise from Hamas. But that confidence was shaken later that month when antisemitic rioters stormed Dagestan\u2019s Makhachkala Uytash Airport where a flight from Israel arrived. At\u00a0least 20 people were injured and 60 people were detained in the chaotic clashes, according to local authorities.  Multiple videos on social media showed a crowd of people inside the airport and on the runway, some waving the Palestinian flag, others forcing their way through closed doors in the international terminal. Interreligious violence is something that Russian leader Putin is \u201cvery, very worried\u201d about, said former CNN Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty in response to Sunday\u2019s attacks in Dagestan. Russia has a complex web of relationships in the Middle East: Putin backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (an enemy of Israel);\u00a0he relies on Iran\u00a0(another enemy of Israel) for a stockpile of drones to attack Ukraine; and he\u2019s a\u00a0high-fiving friend\u00a0of\u00a0Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, another power player in the region. He has also maintained cordial working relationships with Israeli counterparts, although\u00a0his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cooled. ISIS-K attack on music venue The coordinated attacks in Dagestan come just weeks after Russia suffered its worst terror attack in decades. In March, over 130 people were killed after assailants stormed a popular concert venue complex on the outskirts of Moscow. ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the massacre and four gunmen from the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan were charged with terrorism. The shocking terror attack came just a week after Putin won a stage-managed election which tightened his grip on the country he has ruled since the turn of the century. For a leader who has long promised security and stability to Russians, the major attack on Russian soil was another powerful blow. The emotion unleashed by the rampage \u2013 combined with the disturbing videos \u2013 unleashed a wave of xenophobia from some towards Central Asian migrant workers in general. Migrants from the former Soviet Union\u2019s Central Asian states \u2014 Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan \u2014 have traditionally been a valuable source of cheap labor in Russia. In the aftermath of the March attack, Putin called for Russia to remain united. \u201cWe must never forget that we are a multinational, multi-religious country. We must always treat our brothers, representatives of other faiths with respect, as we always do \u2014 Muslims, Jews, everyone,\u201d he said. But Sunday\u2019s attack in Dagestan shows deep fissures continue to pockmark Russia\u2019s border regions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/europe/russia-dagestan-attacks-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said a suspected balloon\u00a0was seen flying in northern Gyeonggi Province, which borders Seoul, around 9 p.m. local time (8 p.m. ET). Seoul\u2019s Metropolitan government later sent out a push notification alerting the city that a North Korean balloon had entered the sky over Seoul, adding that citizens should refrain from touching downed balloons and report any sightings to authorities. North Korea has sent over 1,000 balloons toward the South since May, which\u00a0it calls\u00a0reprisals for South Korean activists flying leaflets that contain materials critical of the regime of its leader Kim Jong\u00a0Un. On Thursday, a South Korean advocacy group flew 20 large balloons carrying thousands of anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets and USB sticks with South Korean entertainment toward North Korea. A day later, on Friday, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea\u2019s leader, warned of \u201ctrouble\u201d ahead. \u201cWhen you do something you were clearly warned not to do, it\u2019s only natural that you will find yourself dealing with something you didn\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. A South Korean\u00a0analysis of North Korean balloons sent between late May and early June detected\u00a0parasites in the balloons\u2019 soil, which \u201cmay have originated from human feces,\u201d the ministry said, pointing to \u201chuman genes\u201d found in the soil. The analysis found roundworms, whipworms and larva currens along with other waste, such as cloth and wastepaper, the ministry said, adding there was no risk of contamination or infectious disease from the analyzed soil. The balloons also carried damaged clothes from a South Korean brand, signaling \u201chostility towards South Korean goods,\u201d as well as clothes with imitations of Disney characters, according to the ministry. The latest balloon salvo comes as tensions on the Korean Peninsula heighten, and inter-Korean diplomacy remains at an impasse.\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a defense agreement with North Korea last week as talks on its denuclearization efforts have stalled, and Kim has\u00a0vowed to expand his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal\u00a0and threatened to use it against the South. In the meantime, a US Navy aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea over the weekend ahead of trilateral exercises with South Korea and Japan in the waters near the peninsula. It is the latest in a series of US military moves aiming to affirm Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to its treaty ally in South Korea. US and South Korean officials signed a\u00a0new memorandum of understanding\u00a0on diplomatic intelligence sharing and analysis on Monday, according to South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry. Japanese, South Korean and U.S. officials also held a trilateral call where they issued a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0that called the deepening security cooperation between Russia and North Korea a matter of \u201cgrave concern\u201d to those seeking to maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula. \u201cThe United States, ROK, and Japan condemn in the strongest possible terms deepening military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia, including continued arms transfers from the DPRK to Russia that prolong the suffering of the Ukrainian people, violate multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and threaten stability in both Northeast Asia and Europe,\u201d the statement said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/north-korean-balloons-south-korea-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

The tourist received a Whatsapp message from an employee at the popular destination\u2019s Hotel Material telling him the booking scheduled for June had been canceled in response to the conflict in Gaza, according to the Israeli Embassy in Tokyo. One message, confirmed to CNN, is said to have read: \u201cWe are sorry to inform you that, due to war crimes being committed by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) members in the conflict taking place in Gaza between Israel and Palestine, we are not able to accept reservations from persons we believe might have ties to the Israeli army.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why the hotel employee believed the person had ties to the Israeli army. The traveler who received the Whatsapp messages made an initial complaint to the Israeli embassy in Tokyo. The person was able to make a new reservation at a different hotel in Kyoto and continued his trip as planned. The Embassy accused the hotel of \u201ca clear case of discrimination\u201d when the news of the alleged incident went viral last week. The hotel, which has not responded to multiple requests from CNN for comment, was also strongly reprimanded by Kyoto\u2019s city government, which accused it of breaching Japan\u2019s Hotel Business Act, which regulates the hospitality industry. \u201cOur position is to provide safe, secure, and high-quality accommodation for citizens and travelers, and we will respond strictly to situations that do not conform to this, such as this one,\u201d a representative for the Kyoto city government told CNN, adding that a city representative visited the hotel in person to inform them of the legal violation. \u2018Singular incident\u2019 Ido Bromberg, a political counselor at the Israeli Embassy, told CNN that the person who allegedly sent the Whatsapp messages was a low-level employee at the Hotel Material, not its general manager, owner or director. The Embassy has sent a formal complaint letter to the Japanese government, but Bromberg emphasized that there is no animosity between the two countries. \u201cWe know that this is not a characteristic of Japan in general or the hotel industry in Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that the hospitality of Japanese hotels is excellent and extremely nice, so we hope that the hotel will take necessary measures to make sure this will not happen again, and with the specific employee.\u201d \u201cWe see this as a very singular incident, and we hope it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Bromberg noted that there is a direct flight between Tokyo and Tel Aviv operated by Israel\u2019s national carrier El Al and says that Japan is a \u201cfavorable\u201d destination for Israeli tourists. The Israeli embassy says it would appreciate an apology from the hotel but will not pursue any legal action over the allegation. On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants entered Israel via Gaza, taking about 250 people hostage in a violent terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel was \u201cat war\u201d shortly afterward. Since then, more than 37,000 people have been killed in Gaza by Israeli military offensives, according to Gaza health authorities. A United Nations inquiry this month found that both Israel and Hamas have committed war crimes amid the war in Gaza.

{"id": "2024_06_23_middleeast_netanyahu-israel-us-weapons-spat-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended his decision to go public about delays in the supply of weapons from the United States, saying months of private discussions did not yield any results. At the beginning of a cabinet meeting Sunday, Netanyahu said that \u201cafter months of no change in this situation, I decided to give it a public expression. I did this based on years of experience, and knowing that this step is essential to extracting the cork.\u201d Netanyahu claimed on Tuesday that the Biden administration was \u201cwithholding weapons\u201d in a video posted to X, claiming that Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u201cassured me that the administration is working day and night to remove these bottlenecks.\u201d In response, US envoy Amos Hochstein told Netanyahu that his comments were \u201cunproductive\u201d and \u201cmore importantly, completely untrue.\u201d While not the first time Netanyahu has publicly lambasted the Biden administration\u00a0in the course of the Israel-Hamas war, the dispute comes as the stakes around the war in Gaza and a potential further conflict between Israel and Hezbollah remain high. The US remains Israel\u2019s most important ally and biggest supplier of arms but has voiced increasing concern over the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza. Speaking during the meeting Sunday, Netanyahu said: \u201cAbout four months ago, there was a dramatic drop in the supply of armaments arriving from the US to Israel. For weeks we asked our American friends to speed up the shipments. We did it time and time again.\u201d \u201cWe did it at the highest levels, and at all levels, and I want to emphasize - we did it in private rooms.

Our ties are crucial and perhaps more important than ever, at this time,\u201d Gallant told reporters, according to a statement from the\u00a0Israeli\u00a0defense\u00a0ministry. Gallant is set to discuss Israel\u2019s war against Hamas and \u201cefforts to ensure the return of the hostages\u201d as well as \u201cmeasures required to achieve regional stability,\u201d according to the statement. The Israeli defense minister has clashed with Netanyahu, who is facing an ongoing battle to keep his government together. While Gallant - a retired general - went public earlier this year and said there should be no Israeli rule in post-war Gaza, far-right members of the cabinet oppose any future independent Palestinian state. In his statement, Gallant spoke of the transition to a \u201cPhase C\u201d in Gaza. It\u2019s unclear whether he was referring to a different stage in the fighting or how to prepare for post conflict.

Portland\u2019s downtown sits on a hilly peninsula surrounded on three sides by water. To the east is Casco Bay, a broad inlet dotted with islands connected to the city by daily ferry service. Within a short drive are beaches, waterfront parks, seaside trails and six working lighthouses. Portland is Maine\u2019s largest city, and yet its 68,000 residents would fit comfortably inside an NFL stadium. Even so, the city offers a buffet of metropolis-level cultural attractions, from a symphony and live theater to professional baseball, basketball, soccer and hockey. This variety and compactness suits locals just fine. \u201cIt\u2019s just the right size,\u201d said Jamie Kingman Rice, a deputy director of the Maine Historical Society. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to do. It\u2019s got a lot of great culture and restaurants. It\u2019s a walkable city. You get sort of a big-city feel in a small-city package.\u201d On the waterfront With its coastal New England vibe, Portland can feel like a smaller cousin of Boston, the historic Massachusetts capital about two hours\u2019 drive to the south. Some people confuse it with its namesake across the country, the much larger Portland, Oregon. But the city has plenty of vibrant history of its own. Settled by British explorers in the 1600s, colonial Portland soon became a thriving seaport, spurred in part by the Royal Navy\u2019s reliance on harvesting Maine\u2019s towering white pines as masts for its ships. Canadian cities such as Montreal also relied on Portland for transatlantic goods, since the Saint Lawrence River often froze solid in the winter. To help facilitate the flow of shipping in Portland\u2019s busy harbor, a sea captain in 1807 built on a hill an 86-foot tower with a telescope that could identify incoming ships from some 30 miles away. The invention of two-way radio rendered the observatory obsolete by the 1920s, but it\u2019s been restored and is open for tours today as the only remaining signal tower of its kind in the United States. The city survived four major fires, most recently on the Fourth of July in 1866, when fireworks ignited a blaze at a sugar factory. That fire wiped out many of Portland\u2019s historic buildings, although some on its outskirts survived \u2014 including the handsome Tate House, built in 1755 for a naval captain and the only pre-Revolutionary home in greater Portland open to the public as a museum. Today, Portland\u2019s waterfront holds everything from boutique hotels to dockside seafood joints serving fried clams and steamed lobsters on paper plates. Its busy harbor hosts a wide variety of watercraft, from fishing boats to commercial tankers to cruise ships. For visitors, the easiest way to get out on the water is via Casco Bay Lines, which offers dozens of ferries each day from Portland\u2019s Old Port to six of the bay\u2019s islands. Several islands offer overnight lodging, restaurants, beaches and bike rentals. The ferries run 365 days a year and are a lifeline for the islands\u2019 residents, many of whom commute to jobs and schools in Portland, said Nick Mavodones, Casco Bay Lines\u2019 operations manager. For passengers they also offer a bounty of sights, from lighthouses and sailing ships to historic spots such as Fort Gorges, a granite fortress built on a small island during the Civil War. Tourists can even board a working mailboat, which delivers letters, packages and freight to the islands on a three-hour tour. \u201cYou\u2019ll get to see working lobstermen, you\u2019ll get to see seals,\u201d said Mavodones, who also happens to be a former Portland mayor. \u201cYou also can see cormorants, eagles and great blue herons.\u201d \u2018Innovation and entrepreneurship in the food scene\u2019 Like many US cities, Portland experienced a slump in the 1960s and \u201870s as residents moved to the suburbs and shopping malls drained some of the street life from downtown. It\u2019s since come roaring back, spurred by urban revitalization projects, tourism and the city\u2019s growing reputation as a foodie hotspot. Locals trace the city\u2019s dining renaissance to the 1996 opening of Fore Street, a farm-to-table pioneer which continues to serve elevated cuisine in a brick warehouse two blocks from the waterfront. Over the years the restaurant has won numerous accolades and its owners have since opened two upscale seafood restaurants \u2014 most recently Scales, in an airy, rustic space on a wharf with harbor views. The city\u2019s restaurant scene got another boost in 2012 when Eventide Oyster Co. opened to national acclaim. While Eventide\u2019s centerpiece is its popular raw bar, some locals say it makes the best lobster roll in the city. In 2018, Bon Appetit named Portland its restaurant city of the year. In recent years the city\u2019s dining offerings have expanded further beyond traditional seafood to include a wide range of ethnic cuisines. Walk down Washington Avenue in the Munjoy Hill neighborhood and you\u2019ll find eateries serving Salvadoran, Vietnamese and East African food. \u201cThe food scene here is made up of a lot of small, owner-operated businesses,\u201d said Rubin, owner of Bar Futo and the newly opened Mr. Tuna, which started several years ago as a sushi cart. Bar Futo\u2019s chef was a semifinalist this year for a James Beard Award. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young chefs here doing some really interesting stuff.\u201d Among them is Ben Wexler-Waite, a New Yorker who went to college in Maine and was inspired to open a Neapolitan pizza business in 2021 after spending time in Italy and working on an organic farm. Instead of a brick-and-mortar location, Wexler-Waite chose something different: an outdoor space on Peaks Island, a 20-minute ferry ride from downtown Portland. His seasonal operation \u2013 a wood-fired oven on wheels, a refrigerated pantry trailer and some picnic tables \u2013 sits on land he leases each summer from the local Lions Club. In tribute, his eatery is called Il Leone \u2013 \u201cthe lion\u201d in Italian. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a really special, wood-fired, island dining experience outdoors in a wooded grove just a few hundred feet from the ocean,\u201d he said. A stickler for authentic and fresh ingredients, Wexler-Waite imports flour and San Marzano tomatoes from Italy while sourcing his vegetables, herbs and other toppings from nearby Maine farms. His efforts have paid off \u2013 in 2022 the Portland Press Herald crowned Il Leone as the best pizza in Maine. \u201cThere\u2019s a unique emphasis among restaurants in Portland about sourcing the best possible ingredients we have here locally,\u201d said Wexler-Waite, who believes emerging chefs are increasingly giving Portland a shot \u2013 and taking culinary risks they might not take if they faced higher rents in bigger cities. \u201cWhen you compare opening a restaurant in Portland to a city like New York, the barrier to entry is lower, and I think that allows for more innovation and entrepreneurship in the food scene.\u201d Witness the city\u2019s showing at this month\u2019s James Beard Awards, where not one but two bakeries were honored: ZU Bakery, a tiny boulangerie whose owner Barak Olins turns out beloved artisanal loaves; and Norimoto Bakery, where Atsuko Fujimoto has won a devoted following for her chocolate sake cake, yuzu meringue pie and other pastries with a Japanese twist. That entrepreneurial spirit also extends to beermaking \u2013 a delicious irony, given Maine\u2019s leading role in the 19th century temperance movement. Portland has more than two dozen breweries \u2013 more per capita than any other city in the country, according to 2019 data. Stalwarts such as Allagash, nationally known for its Belgian styles, and Shipyard, whose Pumpkinhead Ale is a longtime favorite, now share space with a flock of newcomers such as Belleflower, a family-run, small-batch brewery with a broad palette of beers and an inviting taproom. Arts and the outdoors A visitor could spend a week happily eating and drinking their way across town. But Portland offers nourishment for the soul as well. For a small city it has a rich artistic tradition. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the 19th century poet who famously penned \u201cPaul Revere\u2019s Ride,\u201d was born here. His childhood home, the oldest standing brick structure on the Portland peninsula, is now a museum. Maine\u2019s rugged coastline inspired Winslow Homer, the landscape artist who painted many of his best watercolors from a seaside studio in Prouts Neck, some 10 miles south of Portland. The studio is open for tours in the summer and early fall. Homer\u2019s works are on display at the Portland Museum of Art, whose broad collection also contains works by Claude Monet, Frederic Edwin Church and Andy Warhol. The museum anchors the city\u2019s Arts District, which includes galleries, performance spaces and an arts college. With its deep green forests and deep blue water views, greater Portland also is surrounded by restorative natural beauty. A popular nearby spot is the Fore River Sanctuary, an 85-acre preserve with freshwater and saltwater marshes, a host of aquatic bird life and Portland\u2019s only natural waterfall. But when it comes to scenery, it\u2019s hard to beat Maine\u2019s craggy coastline and its postcard views of lobster boats and lighthouses. Don\u2019t miss Portland Head Light, an iconic landmark and Maine\u2019s oldest lighthouse, which sits on a rocky point some 5 miles south of Portland. The lighthouse dates to 1791 and was commissioned by George Washington. Portland also makes a good base from which to explore the rest of southern coastal Maine, from the shops of Kennebunkport to the sprawling L.L. Bean flagship store in Freeport to the charming towns of Bath, Rockland and Camden further up Route 1. Wherever you wander, the ocean beckons.

{"id": "2024_06_21_style_amiri-menswear-paris-fashion-week", "text": "Few cities have been so adamantly idealized, mythologized and captured on film and in photographs as Los Angeles and Paris. Inside the majestic\u00a0botanical garden\u00a0of \u201cJardin des Plantes\u201d\u00a0at the heart of Paris earlier this week, Mike Amiri, founder of\u00a0the\u00a0eponymous Californian label, brought these two worlds together in a cinematic show that brought Hollywood to the legendary \u201cRive Gauche\u201d of the\u00a0River\u00a0Seine. Accompanied by the tunes of\u00a0south London musician Yussef Dayes,\u00a0what emerged was\u00a0a collection about \u201cModern jazz, meaning both the music and and attitude\u201d\u00a0according to the show notes. Among influences,\u00a0the designer references Miles Davis\u00a0(who himself\u00a0had a special relationship with the City of Lights), as well as Duke Ellington and his Big Band\u00a0and\u00a0Dizzy Gillespie, all\u00a0of whom\u00a0fascinated him both for their stage presence and their off-stage life. These inspirations translated into\u00a0pieces in\u00a0faded, sun-washed teal, blue, gray and vintage-inspired knits. Formal tuxedos with d\u00e9grad\u00e9 beadings were fused with slouchier lines and flared pants as a nod to skate culture,\u00a0or\u00a0elevated with crystal-pinstripes. Like a golden thread running through the collection, models wore drum bags featuring a guitar pick as a lock, or music notes as brooches holding together a silk foulard. Interested both in craft and attitude,\u00a0Amiri, 47, sought\u00a0to be \u201coptimistic, not loud,\u201d as he put it\u00a0during a meeting a few days before the show. In the midst of model castings and fittings, he was calm and elegant, multi-tasking as his son Ryan, 13, came to join him in putting\u00a0the\u00a0final touches to the collection in a\u00a0temporary\u00a0studio set up near Paris\u2019s Avenue Montaigne. Amiri\u2019s two other children and wife were also in the city and present at the show. Since its launch in 2014, Amiri has looked to musicians as well as Americana\u00a0for a transcontinental discussion\u00a0of\u00a0luxury\u00a0\u2014\u00a0mixing thrifting with subcultures\u00a0such as\u00a0rock\u2019n\u2019roll, garage and skate. Having grown up in Hollywood to \u00e9migr\u00e9 Iranian parents, two blocks away from Hollywood Boulevard, Amiri was also deeply impacted by the stark cultural differences between LA neighborhoods such as Silver Lake, Venice Beach and the styles\u00a0that came with\u00a0that. Today, the designer has made a name for himself for the quality of his garments\u00a0and\u00a0his fluid, creative approach\u00a0that\u00a0walks a line between elegance and hype. The people he dresses all \u201cwant to have personality, but they don\u2019t want to look like they\u2019re faking young, it\u2019s a fine balance between looking modern and faking youth\u201d he said. Despite the recent announcement of South Korean musician Kim Sunwoo of K-pop band \u201cThe Boyz\u201d becoming a brand ambassador, many of Amiri\u2019s stars find\u00a0their\u00a0way to the independent\u00a0label organically, rather than by way of paid endorsements, the brand said. Perhaps because the world of celebrity is one Amiri is comfortable in, having been to\u00a0school with Angelina Jolie and Lenny Kravitz\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who he recently dressed (alongside\u00a0a diverse roster of celebrities such as like Ryan Gosling, Omar Sy, Lena Waithe and Barry Keoghan).\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important not to chase everything, let it be organic,\u201d he said at the studio while examining final runway looks.\u00a0\u201cThe right people find you.\u201d In an age of hyper-visibility,\u00a0Amiri\u00a0appears\u00a0to be rethinking luxury\u00a0\u2014 or\u00a0\u201cmaking ordinary things extraordinary\u201d as he put it. This includes focusing on detail so fine it might not appear on camera, such as couture-level craftsmanship infused with DIY\u00a0techniques, twisting and reworking denim, leather and seemingly mundane textiles. To James Sleaford, editor-in-chief of men\u2019s fashion magazine ICON France, Amiri has fine-tuned chic, offering a fusion of American cool and technical know-how: \u201cPeople recognize a lot of what he does, the ripped jeans, but what you see when you look at the shows is pretty different, he is very cultured, and very into his tailoring\u201d he said. \u201cHe has brought\u00a0a real element of luxury to\u00a0American cool.\u201d Today, with a flagship boutique on Rodeo\u00a0Drive, the \u201cAmiri Prize,\u201d an award to \u201cencourage, nurture and showcase up-and-coming talent,\u201d a second retail space in Dubai and a pop-up store in Saint Tropez,\u00a0Amiri is\u00a0pursuing a worldwide dialogue.\u00a0\u201cIn a world where everything is shared and visible, there is definitely a blending of cultures\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not through geography, but the things people gravitate towards,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\u2026\u00a0people connect to your story, your aesthetic, maybe it\u2019s something about them they find in there,\u201d he continued.\u00a0\u201cSomething they want to bring out in themselves.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/style/amiri-menswear-paris-fashion-week/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_weather_south-heat-wave-midwest-flood-recovery", "text": "Dangerous heat is setting its sights on millions of Americans across the South and Plains on Monday, including several communities recovering from destructive flooding over the weekend. Here\u2019s the latest. \u2022 Heat heads to the South: The unrelenting heat shifts into the South and Southern Plains on Monday and Tuesday, bringing temperatures in the mid to upper 90s. Some cities could even see 100-degree highs, including Dallas and Little Rock, Arkansas. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels in humidity and high temperatures \u2013 could top a dangerous 110 degrees in some areas. \u2022 Flood-stricken communities begin recovery amid sweltering heat: Heat alerts on Monday spread over 1,000 miles from North Florida to South Dakota, which was among several states inundated by heavy rain and devastating flooding over the weekend. Heat advisories are in effect for several areas that were swamped with floodwater over the weekend, including parts of\u00a0northern Iowa, southern South Dakota, eastern Nebraska and northern Missouri and Kansas. In Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds has asked President Joe Biden for a major disaster declaration after \u201ccatastrophic flooding\u201d forced some communities to evacuate. \u2022 Minnesota dam compromised: Southern Minnesota\u2019s Rapidan Dam is in \u201cimminent failure condition\u201d after this weekend\u2019s dangerous flooding, Blue Earth County Emergency Management warned Monday. The dam \u2013 about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis \u2013 was intact as of late Monday morning, but water was flowing around it. No evacuation orders were issued as of late Monday morning. \u2022 Record-breaking weekend heat: Daily high-temperature records were broken from New York to Mississippi over the weekend, including some that were more than a century old, as a brutal heat wave embraced the mid-Atlantic and I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to New York. Philadelphia hit 98 degrees on Sunday, shattering its 1888 record of 97 degrees. Both Greenville, Mississippi, and Raleigh, North Carolina, saw a record 100 degrees. People in the region can breathe a sigh of relief Monday as cooler temperatures begin to set in. \u2022 Flooding turns deadly in South Dakota: At least one person died during severe flooding in South Dakota, Governor Kristi Noem said. \u201cI want to remind everybody to remember the power of water and the flow of water, and to stay away from flooded areas,\u201d the governor warned. At least nine people were rescued from rising water in Sioux Falls, where emergency personnel reported stranded drivers and dozens of trapped vehicles. And the flood threat still isn\u2019t over \u2013 several rivers in the state are swollen with floodwater and will continue rising over the next few days, Noem said. \u2022 More than 20 rivers at major flood stage: Flood warnings remain across waterlogged areas of South Dakota, Iowa and southern Minnesota, as well as along rivers that are running well above normal. At least 23 river gauges have reached major flood stage in the area, meaning extensive flooding of buildings, main roadways, and other critical infrastructure is possible, according to the National Weather Service. That number is expected to grow as water continues to collect across creeks and streams, eventually dumping into major rivers. \u2022 \u201cMonsoon-like\u201d conditions coming to the Southwest: An influx of tropical moisture \u2013 some of which is from Tropical Storm Alberto \u2013 is bringing \u201cmonsoon-like conditions\u201d to the Southwest, the Weather Prediction Center said. Thunderstorms are possible through midweek as a result. While the rainfall may be welcomed by firefighters battling several active wildfires in the region, too much rain could trigger flooding and debris flows, making it difficult for crews to access burn areas. Where heat will go next A heat dome building over the southwestern and south-central US early this week will push temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal each afternoon in an area spanning from the West into the Southeast. High temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s are expected Monday from southern South Dakota through the Southeast. A handful of daily record high temperatures could fall in parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and a few are at risk in Mississippi. The southern tier of the country will remain the epicenter for sizzling conditions Tuesday with high temperatures in the low 100s likely in the southern Plains and Southeast. Atlanta is forecast to top out in the upper 90s both Tuesday and Wednesday, about 10 degrees above normal for late June. By Wednesday, heat will briefly shift back into some of the same areas of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast that baked last week, but it won\u2019t touch the extreme nature of last week\u2019s oven-like conditions. Temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s will return in the mid-Atlantic and 90s will return as far north as southern New England. A few daily high temperature records are in jeopardy Wednesday \u2013 including DC and Baltimore \u2013 but much of the northeast US will avoid unseasonable heat. Stormy weather maintains flood threat There will be rain chances for heavily flooded areas of the Midwest most of this week. A level 2 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms is in effect over the area Monday and Tuesday and some of these storms could unload rounds of heavy rainfall. Exactly how much rain falls and where depends on how thunderstorms develop each afternoon, but the heaviest storms could unload more than an inch of rain in a short time. That\u2019s more than enough to cause additional flooding concerns in areas that can\u2019t take much more rain. Storms are expected to roar to life each day in the late afternoon or early evening hours and remain a threat overnight. Damaging wind gusts and hail\u00a0are also threats with any severe thunderstorm early this week. After a brief break on Wednesday, additional heavy rain is possible in the same areas Thursday and Friday.

{"id": "2024_06_17_tech_mcdonalds-ai-drive-thru-program", "text": "McDonald\u2019s is pulling the plug on artificial intelligence ordering technology it was testing at more than 100 restaurant drive-thru systems in the US, a possible hiccup in the rapid rollout of AI in the fast food industry. The company had worked with IBM to develop and test AI-driven, voice-automated ordering at some of its restaurants. The fast food giant says it\u2019s still working on AI-related solutions at a time when its rivals are making similar investments. It plans to shut off the technology in restaurants participating in the test \u201cno later than July 26, 2024,\u201d according to reporting from trade publication Restaurant Business. \u201cIBM remains a trusted partner and we will still utilize many of their products across our global System,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in an email sent to franchisees and shared with CNN. But the company suggested it will look at AI partners other than IBM. McDonald\u2019s and IBM launched their partnership in 2021, announcing the development of Automated Order Taking (AOT) technology to create a more convenient and simplified ordering experience for its customers and restaurant teams as a part of its \u201cAccelerating the Arches\u201d growth plan. IBM said the AOT\u00a0technology that emerged from the partnership has \u201csome of the most comprehensive capabilities in the industry, fast and accurate\u201d in\u00a0demanding conditions. \u201cWhile McDonald\u2019s is revaluating and refining its plans for AOT, we look forward to continuing to work with them on a variety of other projects,\u201d IBM said in a statement. McDonald\u2019s says this is not the end of\u00a0its AI efforts. It plans to\u00a0\u201cevaluate long-term, scalable solutions\u201d for voice-ordering by the end of 2024. \u201cAI is clearly going to be a part of restaurant automation and efficiencies going forward, but the technology is still in its infancy,\u201d said David Henkes, senior principal and head of strategic partnerships at Technomic. \u201cThe McDonald\u2019s experience and commitment to AI shows the potential upside, but it also shows the limitations of the technology at the present time.\u201d McDonald\u2019s is not the only fast-food chain experimenting with AI. Other companies like White Castle tested out an automated drive-thru ordering system in 2021, and Wendy\u2019s expanded its partnership with Google Cloud to roll out its own AI ordering tool in May last year. Despite fast-food companies\u2019 enthusiasm to integrate AI-powered solutions into their daily operations, the technology has still hit snags. Some customers have complained about AI getting their orders wrong \u2014 a result of the technology\u2019s inability to recognize some accents and distinguish the customer\u2019s voice from background noise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/tech/mcdonalds-ai-drive-thru-program/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_middleeast_israel-hostage-forum-video-netanyahu-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said he was still \u201ccommitted\u201d to an Israeli ceasefire and hostage release proposal backed by the United States as he faced blowback from families of Israeli hostages for appearing to walk back his support of the proposal the day before. The proposal, outlined by US President Joe Biden last month, sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But on Sunday, Netanyahu told Israel\u2019s Channel 14 he was ready to make \u201ca partial deal\u201d with Hamas to return only some hostages from Gaza, in comments that were at odds with the proposal, which was approved by his own war cabinet. He added that Israel will continue fighting in the enclave after the ceasefire. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the war is going to end, but the war in its current stage is going to end in Rafah. This is true. We will continue mowing the grass later,\u201d Netanyahu told the right-wing broadcaster in what was his first one-to-one interview with local Israeli media since October 7. His apparent dismissal of the ceasefire and hostage release proposal faced an angry backlash from Israeli politicians and a group representing Israel\u2019s hostages and their families, which has become a potent political force in the country. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum called Netanyahu\u2019s comments to Channel 14 \u201can unprecedented national failure and a failure to meet the goals of the war.\u201d Opposition figure Gadi Eisenkot \u2013 who resigned from Israel\u2019s war cabinet a week before Netanyahu disbanded it \u2013 also slammed Netanyahu, saying \u201cthere are soldiers who are fighting now because they have war goals to return the hostages.\u201d On Monday, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US opposes continued military operations in Gaza. \u201cThat\u2019s just a recipe for continued conflict, continued instability and continued insecurity for Israel,\u201d he told a press briefing. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum later released a video showing the kidnapping of three Israelis by Hamas on October 7. The video shows Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Or Levy and Eliya Cohen in the back of a pickup truck, being driven along a tree-lined road in southern Israel by militants wielding assault weapons. \u201cHere are the dogs, here they are,\u201d one of the gunmen can be heard saying. Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli citizen then aged 23, can be seen with his face bloodied and what appears to be bone protruding from his left arm \u2013 blown off after a grenade was tossed into the bunker in which he and several others had been hiding from Hamas gunmen. Hamas released a video of Goldberg-Polin in April, the first proof that he survived the blast. In the video, he criticized Netanyahu\u2019s government, as other Israeli hostages in Hamas propaganda videos have done. Held in Gaza for six months at the time, he was almost certainly speaking under duress. \u201cEvery day that passes puts the hostages at greater risk and diminishes our chances of bringing them back safely,\u201d the Forum said in a statement, calling for a deal that brings all of the hostages home. \u2018An important correction\u2019 Netanyahu scrambled to walk back his comments to Channel 14. On Monday, an Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel has stressed to Hamas through mediators Qatar and Egypt that it\u2019s committed to the Israeli ceasefire and hostage release proposal. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s words at the Knesset were an important correction. To this day he has not said publicly that he supports the Israeli proposal.\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s words move the ball to Hamas\u2019 court. If Hamas says yes, there will be a deal. We now need to push for a deal with everything we got,\u201d the Israeli source said. In a short statement issued after his interview Sunday, Netanyahu\u2019s office sought to clarify what he said, saying the prime minister had \u201cmade it clear that we will not leave Gaza until we return all 120 of our hostages, living and deceased.\u201d Seeking to row back his explosive comments even further, Netanyahu on Monday told the Knesset: \u201cWe are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden welcomed. Our position has not changed.\u201d The release of the video may be intended to refocus minds in Israel\u2019s security cabinet, reminding Netanyahu and other senior officials of the war\u2019s initial aim to return the hostages, many of whom remain in Gaza nearly nine months after their abduction. It came as the number of hostages believed to be dead rose to 42 with the announcement by the Israeli military that one of its soldiers, Sergeant Major Mhamad El Atrash, 39, was killed on October 7 and that his body is being held by Hamas. Previously, on June 8, the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office said it believes that at least 41 hostages from the October 7 attack are dead, with their bodies being held in the Gaza Strip. At least five American hostages are believed to be held alive and four others believed to be dead. More than a million Palestinians were taking shelter in Rafah before Israel started its air and ground operation in the southern Gazan city, defying calls from the international community not to proceed.

Ksenia Karelina, 33, was detained in Yekaterinburg earlier this year while visiting her grandparents. She is accused of donating $51.80 to a Ukrainian charity in the US, according to her employer \u2013 a spa in Beverly Hills, California. Her trial began Thursday morning in Sverdlovsk regional court behind closed doors. The next hearing in her trial will be held on August 7, Russian state news agency TASS reported later Thursday. If convicted, she faces up to 20 years in prison. Karelina, a Los Angeles resident and amateur ballerina who became a US citizen in 2021, entered Russia in January but the US did not learn of her arrest until February 8. Chris Van Deerden, Karelina\u2019s boyfriend, told CNN he had bought her tickets to visit the country as a birthday gift.

If, however, we absolutely must, the way to make that experience the best it can possibly be is to fly with Qatar Airways. At least that\u2019s the verdict from this year\u2019s Skytrax Awards, which were announced Monday. For the eighth time in the 25-year history of the prestigious awards \u2013 known as the Oscars of commercial aviation \u2013 Qatar was named the World\u2019s Best Airline, in recognition of the quality of service it offers passengers on its modern fleet. \u201cThis is a remarkable achievement for Qatar Airways to win this World\u2019s Best Airline title for 2024, the eighth time they have triumphed,\u201d Skytrax CEO Edward Plaisted said in a statement to mark the award ceremony, which gathered airline execs and cabin crew in a manor house near London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. \u201cWe congratulate Qatar Airways on this success which should be a source of great pride and satisfaction for the airline management and staff.\u201d The Middle Eastern carrier has built a strong reputation over the past decade, helping Qatar\u2019s award-winning Hamad International Airport establish itself as a global aviation hub to challenge regional rivals Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Qatar\u2019s fleet of 230 airplanes ranges from its 10 much-loved A380 superjumbos, to Boeing 777-300ERs, Boeing 787-8s and 787-9s, Airbus A350-900s and A350-1000s, plus a range of smaller capacity jets. \u201cThis is a proud Qatar Airways moment and it is my honor to share this award with my hard working colleagues,\u201d the airline\u2019s CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement released by Skytrax. \u201cThis award is testimony to our relentless dedication to providing unparalleled service and innovation. We look forward to more wins in the future.\u201d Close-run contest Qatar\u2019s victory meant second place for last year\u2019s winner, Singapore Airlines, but only just. UK-based Skytrax said the votes, gathered from surveys of more than 21 million customers from 100 countries about 350 airlines, were the closest run since the awards began in 1999, requiring a recount. The rest of the top 10 was, once again, devoid of North American airlines, with Dubai\u2019s Emirates airline in third, Japan\u2019s ANA All Nippon Airways in fourth, Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific in fifth, Japan Airlines in sixth, Turkish Airlines is seventh, Taiwan\u2019s EVA Air in eighth, Air France in ninth and Swiss International Airlines in 10th. There were plenty of consolation prizes. Five-time winner Singapore picked up the prize for World\u2019s Best Cabin Staff \u2013 an achievement senior VP, Tan Pee Teck, put down to the \u201cunwavering dedication and professionalism\u201d of its in-air teams. Singapore also won for Best First Class service and Best Airline in Asia. ANA, meanwhile, picked up the accolade for World\u2019s Best Airport Services, as well as Best Airline Staff Service in Asia. Saudia was named World\u2019s Most Improved Airline, beating Taiwan\u2019s Starlux and Iceland\u2019s Play into second and third places. At the budget end of flying, AirAsia was once again crowned the World\u2019s Best Low-Cost Airline \u2013 repeating an achievement it has made every year since 2010. Singapore\u2019s Scoot was named the World\u2019s Best Long Haul-Low Cost Airline. AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes said his airline\u2019s unwavering success was thanks to the work of its \u201cAllstars\u201d cabin crew coupled with strong brand loyalty. \u201cNo other companies come to my mind in achieving such a winning streak, and we are very proud of it,\u201d he said in a statement.\u00a0 We dedicate this award to all of our Allstars who work tirelessly to make today happen, and also to everyone who has remained loyal to us through the ups and downs AirAsia has experienced.\u201d Still in Asia, Bangkok Airways picked up the World\u2019s Best Regional Airline prize for the eighth consecutive year, while Vistara was named best India/South Asian carrier and Fiji Airways was Best Airline in the Australia/Pacific region. Ethiopian Airlines was named Africa\u2019s best, for the sixth year in a row. Turkish Airlines was Europe\u2019s best, airBaltic was Eastern Europe\u2019s winner and Hainan Airlines was best in China. Delta Air Lines was declared the Best Airline in North America, also picking up the award for Best Airline Staff Service for the region.

{"id": "travel_richmond-virginia-best-towns-america", "text": "This dynamic city on the James River deserves more of the tourist attention enjoyed by the nation\u2019s capital two hours to the north. Richmond, Virginia \u2014 or \u201cRVA,\u201d as locals call it \u2014 has top-notch museums and intriguing neighborhoods, and it\u2019s a great spot for dining, drinking and getting outdoors. There\u2019s an impressive arts scene and a nearly year-round lineup of festivals. And the city is taking a hard look at its complicated history \u2014 as the capital of the Confederacy during the Civil War and a historic slave trading hub \u2014 and working on ways to better tell the city\u2019s full story. Now\u2019s a great time for visitors to see for themselves how Virginia\u2019s capital city has evolved. Fine food and beverages A thriving food scene is a must for any vibrant US city \u2013 and Richmond delivers with diverse flavors and a high concentration of black-owned restaurants. Chef Michael Lindsey and his wife, Kimberly Love-Lindsey, opened their first restaurant \u2013 Lillie Pearl \u2013 in 2020, mid-pandemic. The restaurant blends West African heirloom ingredients, Southern African-American cuisine and a range of global influences. Lindsey Food Group followed Lillie Pearl by opening two locations of fried chicken fast-casual spot Buttermilk and Honey, and it has added several more restaurants to the portfolio, including modern Chophouse ML Steak downtown and in Chesterfield. Kali Love, a California fusion concept, just opened in June. Global cuisine is evident all over town, from the deliciously messy birria tacos at Maya Latin Kitchen to Afghan fine dining at The Mantu. Discover Richmond Tours offers a handful of food tours that offer visitors a great way to maximize their options and explore the city\u2019s neighborhoods at the same time. The beverage scene is also booming. Scott Jones, co-owner of Triple Crossing Beer, has been part of Richmond\u2019s rise as a beer destination, thanks in part to the city\u2019s extensive Beer Trail, which features more than 30 craft breweries. Since opening the first of three locations in 2014, Jones has witnessed a transformation of the local culture. \u201cThe food scene, the arts scene, music and beer \u2013 they have a symbiotic relationship, and over the years they have melded together and blossomed to help make Richmond a place for people to come visit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe set a high standard for breweries,\u201d says beer columnist Annie Tobey, author of \u201c100 Things to Do in Richmond Before You Die.\u201d \u201cRVA has so many quality breweries that represent a wide range of styles.\u201d Scott\u2019s Addition, a trendy neighborhood that has been designated Richmond\u2019s \u201ccraft beverage capital,\u201d is home to a collection of breweries, including V\u00e4sen and The Veil. The surrounding region is also home to numerous wineries. For sophisticated sips without the buzz there\u2019s Floris, Richmond\u2019s new bespoke tearoom at the renowned Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. (Among the museum\u2019s highlights: the largest collection of Faberg\u00e9 eggs outside of Russia). And for the coffee-inclined, Urban Hang Suite is serving up more than your average latte. Kelli Lemon, co-owner of the Richmond Black Restaurant Experience, opened the caf\u00e9 six years ago as a community gathering and networking space. Lemon\u2019s company is aimed at supporting black-owned culinary brands. Busy neighborhoods full of history Lively neighborhoods make up Richmond\u2019s center, each contributing to the character of the city. Richmond is also home to more than 150 murals, part of an explosion of dynamic street art around town. Known for its cobblestone streets, Shockoe Slip in southeastern downtown features contemporary restaurants and historic architecture bordered on the south by the James River. Just to the east, one of Richmond\u2019s oldest neighborhoods, Shockoe Bottom, holds centuries of history that the city is working to highlight (more on those plans below). Today, the neighborhoods offer a variety of bars, entertainment venues and historical sites, including a museum dedicated to onetime Richmond resident Edgar Allan Poe as well as markers along the Richmond Slave Trail, a self-guided walking route that tells the somber history of slavery in the city. The downtown core is home to business and government buildings, including the Virginia State Capitol, and the American Civil War Museum. One of the museum\u2019s three sites, the American Civil War Museum at Historic Tredegar, currently features \u201cThe Impending Crisis,\u201d an exhibit that explores the division of the United States on the verge of the Civil War. Guided tours are offered of the 1818 White House of the Confederacy, another unit of the museum located in the Court End neighborhood. While Richmond\u2019s Civil War history is well known, the city also played a role in the American Revolutionary War. Patrick Henry, a Founding Father and Virginia\u2019s first post-colonial governor, gave his famous \u201cGive me liberty \u2026 or give me death\u201d speech in 1775 at Historic St. John\u2019s Church in Church Hill. North of the city center, Jackson Ward, once called the Harlem of the South, is a vibrant cultural hub that is home to the Black History Museum & Cultural Center of Virginia. The exhibit \u201cVirginia is for Music Lovers: A History of Virginia\u2019s Black Excellence in Music\u201d opened at the museum recently. West of downtown, the Fan District on the edge of Virginia Commonwealth University campus is known for beautiful Victorian architecture, tree-lined streets, trendy cafes and upscale shops. Art lovers will enjoy the four galleries and rotating common spaces at\u00a0Institute for Contemporary Art\u00a0at VCU, which is free and open to the public Farther west, the Museum District features most of the area\u2019s major museums, including the renowned Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Virginia Museum of History & Culture. Just south of the Museum District, Carytown \u2014 Richmond\u2019s \u201cmile of style\u201d \u2014 is known for specialty shops, restaurants and the historic Byrd Theatre, a \u201cgrand movie palace\u201d that dates to 1928 and still shows a range of films. Across the James River from downtown, up-and-coming Manchester is known today for its industrial-chic vibe, art studios and scenic views of the river and downtown skyline. The Richmond Slave Trail starts here at the Manchester Docks. A hard look at the past In northeast Richmond, the statues of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and other Confederate leaders that once lined Monument Avenue have been removed. Once home to more Confederate statues than any US city, their removal amid protests against racial injustice beginning in 2020 has been part of the city\u2019s reckoning with the long and complicated shadow the Civil War and slavery cast over Richmond\u2019s reputation. \u201cTheir removal has been part of a broader effort to engage with the city\u2019s complex history,\u201d says Carla Murray, director of marketing communications for Richmond Region Tourism. \u201cThe history is controversial, but we are committed to telling the full story.\u201d The monuments were transferred to the care of the Black History Museum & Cultural Center of Virginia, with oversight by the Valentine Museum. One of the statues is on display at the Valentine. The Jefferson Davis statue \u2014 the work of sculptor Edward Valentine, the museum\u2019s first president \u2014 was erected on Monument Avenue in 1907. The sculpture is covered in paint and displayed tipped over on its side, as it was when it was toppled by protesters in June 2020. The Valentine family pushed the \u201cLost Cause\u201d myth reframing the Civil War, which is the subject of a new exhibit. The Shockoe neighborhoods downtown are the focus of the The Shockoe Project, a City of Richmond effort to bring greater emphasis to the story of enslavement with numerous planned sites, including a National Slavery Museum. The city still has work to do in sharing a new story with would-be visitors, says Lemon, of the Richmond Black Restaurant Experience, who also sits on the board of Virginia Tourism Corporation. \u201cI truly want people to visit this area, but you\u2019re going to have to take the old way of thinking out if you want to enjoy this city. In the years since \u2018RVA\u2019 became an official brand \u2026 the community has worked to change the narrative,\u201d says Lemon, referring to the successful RVA rebranding push launched more than a dozen years ago. Lemon hopes that while taking in the city\u2019s history, visitors will also come to know RVA as the center of diversity, entrepreneurship and creativity that it is. Outdoor entertainment That human creativity is joined by the city\u2019s natural assets and appetite for fun. Nature lovers will adore Maymont, a sprawling 100-acre Victorian estate and public park that sits along the James River. Maymont plans to unveil its Virginia Wildlife Trail\u00a0in fall 2024, which will more cohesively and accessibly connect trails winding through the habitats of 300+ native and domestic animals and add facilities that present educational programming. Not far from Maymont, the gorgeous 50-acre Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden will soon celebrate its 40th anniversary with a major renovation. The city\u2019s diverse festival season is nearly year-round. The 20th Richmond Folk Festival, one of Virginia\u2019s largest events, runs from September 27-29.\u00a0 On August 11, nearly 100,000 attendees will flock to the Carytown Watermelon Festival, Virginia\u2019s largest single-day festival for music, a vibrant summer atmosphere, and, of course, watermelon. RVA\u2019s beloved Minor League baseball team, the Flying Squirrels, is gearing up for a new 10,000-seat stadium expected to open in 2026. In the meantime, games are played at The Diamond, the city\u2019s baseball home since 1985. And opening in summer 2025, the 7,500-seat Riverfront Amphitheater will be a four-acre, open-air venue with stunning views of the downtown skyline and the James River. The river offers plenty of recreation opportunities on its own. The 600-acre James River Park system features more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) of trails and water activities, including rare urban Class IV white water rapids. \u201cIt is simply amazing,\u201d says Tobey. \u201cYou can be on the trails or paddling the rapids, and when you\u2019re done, you can be at a great restaurant in 10 minutes.\u201d That easy hop from one interesting spot to the next is just one more reason to head to Richmond right now.

{"id": "2024_06_21_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-charges-sentencing", "text": "One of\u00a0several Americans recently charged\u00a0with having ammunition in Turks and Caicos is expected to go home after a court issued a suspended sentence and fined him $2,000. Ryan Tyler Watson of Oklahoma pleaded guilty last month to possessing four rounds of ammunition, a spokesperson for the government of Turks and Caicos said. He had been released on bail and ordered to stay on the islands while awaiting this sentence. On Friday, Watson received a 13-week suspended sentence and a $2,000 fine \u2013 $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on Friday. Watson will not need to serve the 13-week sentence \u201cas long as he doesn\u2019t commit any crimes and keeps the peace in the TCI within 9 months,\u201d the court spokesperson said. Watson \u201cis now allowed to leave \u2026 as he\u2019s now cleared with the justice in the TCI.\u201d Watson is expected to return to Oklahoma City by Friday night, according to Jonathan Franks, a spokesperson for\u00a0Bring Our Families Home. \u201cWe will make payment shortly, depart TCI and anticipate being home in OKC tonight,\u201d Franks posted on X from the courthouse. Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays. But bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The British Overseas Territory doesn\u2019t manufacture guns or ammunition, yet the number of firearms making their way to the islands has increased, Turks and Caicos Premier C. Washington\u00a0Misick said in May. By contrast, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. \u201cIn the\u00a0Turks\u00a0and Caicos Islands, the law stands firm and applies to everyone equally, without exception,\u201d\u00a0Misick said in a statement last month. Turks and Caicos recently revised part of its firearms law after a bipartisan group of US Congress members traveled to the islands southeast of the Bahamas and asked officials to drop charges against five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. The new amendment clarifies when sentencing for firearms-related offenses, courts have the discretion to impose either a fine, a custodial sentence, or a mixture of both in exceptional circumstances. Previously, the law required courts to impose both a fine and a prison sentence of 12 years \u2013 though it allowed reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Watson is the first of those five Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, which went into effect Wednesday. What\u2019s happened to the other Americans At least four other Americans have recently been arrested in Turks and Caicos on charges of having ammunition. Bryan Hagerich is\u00a0back\u00a0in the\u00a0United States\u00a0after receiving a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine.\u00a0Hagerich\u00a0was allowed to leave the\u00a0territory\u00a0and return to the US after he paid the fine, his attorney Oliver Smith said. Tyler Wenrich\u00a0pleaded guilty and\u00a0was sentenced to time served\u00a0and issued a $9,000 fine, according to court records. Michael Lee Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition,\u00a0and was scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday \u2013 though it is unclear based on court records if the sentencing happened. CNN has reached out to his attorney for more information. And Sharitta Shinese Grier is expected to plead guilty in court next Tuesday, her attorney Sheena C. Mairto told CNN. The Florida mother said she had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. Grier was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the islands until her case ends, the affiliate reported. She was also ordered to report to a police station weekly. CNN\u2019s Michael Rios, Michelle Watson, Alisha Ebrahimji and Sahar Akbarzai contributed to this report.

On the eve of the city\u2019s prestigious Haute Couture shows, famous faces \u2014 and paying guests willing to fork out thousands of dollars for a seat \u2014 piled into the cobbled plaza to watch a thematic runway tracking the 100 years between the last Paris Olympic Games, in 1924, and now. Sporting categories were twinned with time periods, and while dancers re-enacted the careful choreography of 1960s fencing or 1970s gymnastics, models strutted alongside in loosely corresponding looks. But a catwalk filled with leggings and track shorts, this was not. One of the most surprising ensembles came from Katy Perry, in an archival Noir Kei Ninomiya cut-out gown for the show\u2019s section on 1980s martial arts. Fashioned entirely out of perfectly placed interlocking leather petals, with a full, tulle-flower skirt to boot, Perry\u2019s outfit looked more like a feat of geometry than physical education. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever walked,\u201d she whispered into the camera in an Instagram story posted before her appearance. \u201cI mean I\u2019ve walked before in life.

From Elle Fanning, Kim Kardashian and Doja Cat at the Met Gala, to Charlize Theron, Jennifer Lawrence and Florence Pugh at the Oscars, more and more celebrities have been embracing a full-frontal look. But while most naked dresses rely on flesh-coloured mesh or crystal netting to subtly suggest nudity, Perry\u2019s frock featured more skin than skirt \u2014 with just a small percentage of her body covered by the leather shapes. Perry wasn\u2019t the only A-lister flirting with a state of undress. Jared Leto, too, arrived at Vogue World in a transparent sleeveless tunic and a pair of black briefs. He completed his look with black patent riding boots, red-dipped fingers and a necklace hanging with wooden stake-turned-crucifix pendant. While the trend has so far been dominated by women in translucent gowns, the urge to wear less reveals sheer confidence which, of course, is not gender exclusive.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/style/look-of-the-week-katy-perry-flips-the-script-on-the-naked-dress-trend/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Hungarian prime minister wasn\u2019t harmed in the accident and continued his journey to Stuttgart Airport as planned, a police spokesperson told CNN.

{"id": "2024_06_21_style_gen-z-bridal-fashion-trends-bof", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Just an hour after getting engaged in Venice, Italy last year, Christyne de Quesada began scouring the internet for white dresses to wear to her many upcoming wedding-related events: An engagement party, a bachelorette weekend, a civil ceremony at a courthouse and a bigger celebration in Mexico City. But the Miami-based human resources manager had a hard time finding good quality, under $1,000 ensembles that reflected her personality. \u201cIt actually drove me a bit crazy,\u201d de Quesada said. \u201cI bought about seven things and returned all of them.\u201d Instead, she decided to look beyond classic bridal wear brands and retailers. She eventually settled on an ivory two-piece set by Shanghai-based label ShuShu Tong, which she bought from the e-tailer Ssense, for her civil ceremony, a Vera Wang gown she describes as \u201ctraditional and very princess-like\u201d for her Mexico City wedding ceremony and a bespoke ivory skirt and corset set by Florida-based bridal designer Gabriella Arango, complete with Gucci shoes, for the reception. Millennial and Gen-Z brides-to-be like de Quesada are no longer shopping for just a wedding dress, but an entire wardrobe for pre- and post-wedding events. That breadth is propelling the global bridal wear market, which is projected to grow at a rate of 3.5 percent annually and is expected to reach $83.5 billion by 2030, according to the Global Bridal Wear Market Industry report. But it\u2019s not companies like David\u2019s Bridal (which filed for bankruptcy and sold to Cion Investment Corp last year) that are benefitting. In order to find less cookie-cutter ensembles that are more reflective of their personal style, this new generation of brides are shopping outside the traditional bridal market. \u201cThe bridal industry is very much like an old boys club. They live by \u2018If it\u2019s not broken, don\u2019t fix it\u2019 and are very comfortable with the limited options that they\u2019ve given you,\u201d said Caroline Crawford Patterson, a bridal stylist and designer. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the consumer is different and there\u2019s a big opportunity to shake things up.\u201d New opportunities in the bridal market After the industry was brought largely to a halt in 2020, weddings returned to pre-pandemic levels last year, with couples hosting over 2 million parties\u00a0, according to The Wedding Report. But the post-pandemic bridal wear landscape is remarkably different. Historically, brides have been limited to independent boutiques, department stores and chains like David\u2019s Bridal. Now, though, brides-to-be are open to wearing any white dress and are casting a wider net. It\u2019s an evolution of a space that was stagnant for a long time. \u201cSalons could get away with offering dresses that weren\u2019t chic or suited the fashion-forward bride or weren\u2019t size inclusive and the consumer, who is already spending a lot of money, just had to bear it,\u201d said Crawford Patterson, who got married in 2021. Anthropologie was one of the first non-bridal retailers to enter the space with the launch of its Bhldn line in 2011. (It\u2019s now called Anthropologie Weddings.) Today, Reformation, Abercrombie & Fitch and Revolve all offer wedding edits on their websites, as does The RealReal. Even fast fashion brands like ASOS, Forever 21, Lulus and Shein are increasing the number of bridal styles they carry. It\u2019s not just mass retail taking advantage. New York-based designer Jackson Wiederhoeft launched a made-to-order bridal segment in 2020 and now spends up to a year and a half developing wedding dresses for clients including initial appointments, fittings, alterations and advising. Despite the investment in time and resources, Wiederhoeft says the effort is \u201cworth it,\u201d as they get to develop an intimate relationship with consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a dress for many people, it is the dress,\u201d said Wiederhoeft. For an emerging designer like Wiederhoeft, bridal is something of a safety net, serving as \u201ca floating line of credit\u201d for the rest of their business. With bridal, Wiederhoeft is able to collect 100 percent of the garment\u2019s cost upfront and directly from the client in order to pay for production, material and overhead costs. A Wiederhoeft wedding dress can cost between $3,000 and $25,000 for ready-to-wear bridal garments; pricing for custom dresses starts at $25,000. And unlike ready-to-wear, the brand\u2019s bridal segment is not subject to discounting. \u201cSome of the garments I made in my apartment four years ago are still in our showroom. I still use them as sale samples, and the styles are quite evergreen,\u201d they said. \u201cWhereas ready-to-wear has the shelf life of an avocado.\u201d What today\u2019s brides want \u2014 and don\u2019t As younger Millennials and Gen-Zers, the oldest of whom turn 27 this year, approach the altar, their ceremonies can differ greatly from previous generations, including their parents. (According to the US Census Bureau, the average American woman is 28.6 years old when they get married and the average American man is 30.5 years old.) Young people today are more likely to support same-sex and interracial marriage, enter into non-traditional relationships such as polyamory, and are more likely to forgo marriage entirely in favor of cohabiting with a partner long-term, according to research from Pew Research Center. \u201cSome of my clients are trying to push against the grain of conventional weddings and are focused on spending money on a house,\u201d said Hillary Taymour, founder and creative director of Collina Strada, who said her clients are looking to splurge on pieces that can be re-worn. Taymour said that today\u2019s brides believe \u201canything can be a wedding outfit.\u201d Her clients are opting for colorful designs and unconventional jewelry, including the brand\u2019s frog ring, which typically retails for $80, that couples have commissioned as engagement or wedding bands to mark the occasion. Catering to a broader spectrum of bridal wear can be beneficial even for a business with a historic focus in the sector, said Andrew Kwon, founder and creative director of his namesake label. He launched an eveningwear line alongside bridal in 2022. \u201cOne of the main challenges with bridal is the lack of repeat clients,\u201d said Kwon. \u201cTapping into eveningwear and colored dress has allowed me to bring in non-traditional brides, their bridesmaids and even their mothers into the fold.\u201d Retailers hoping to capture this new, forward-thinking bridal consumer are updating their assortment to reflect changing attitudes towards weddings. Last month, e-commerce retailer Ssense launched its second \u201canti-bridal\u201d capsule collection which featured unorthodox gowns, flower girl dresses and accessories. \u201cWe speak to an audience that\u2019s very open-minded and fluid,\u201d said Brigitte Chartrand, vice president of womenswear buying and the Everything Else segment at Ssense. \u201cThe products we commissioned didn\u2019t feel necessarily classic \u2026 it brings that differentiation of what bridal could be.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

During an interview with the BBC Friday, Farage was asked if he stood by a tweet posted in February 2022 which called Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine a \u201cconsequence of EU and NATO expansion.\u201d \u201cWhy did I say that? It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union was giving this man [Putin] a reason to his Russian people to say they\u2019re coming for us again, and to go to war,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson. \u201cWe\u2019ve provoked this war \u2013 of course it\u2019s his fault \u2013\u00a0he\u2019s used what we\u2019ve done as an excuse,\u201d he said. Farage \u2013 a former EU parliamentarian \u2013 claimed to be \u201cthe only person in British politics\u201d to predict the invasion of Ukraine. Following his BBC appearance, Farage took to X and clarified his comments. \u201cI am one of the few figures that have been consistent & honest about the war with Russia,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPutin was wrong to invade a sovereign nation, and the EU was wrong to expand eastward.\u201d Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reacted to the comments today while speaking to journalists. \u201cWhat he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin\u2019s hands,\u201d said Sunak. \u201cThis kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain\u2019s security.\u201d Former Conservative defence secretary Ben Wallace spoke to the BBC\u2019s Today program about Farage\u2019s comments, where he called the Reform leader \u201ca bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says \u2018Oh no, if I was running the country\u2019 and presents very simplistic answers to actually, I am afraid in the 21st century, complex problems.\u201d Labour leader Keir Starmer also responded to Farage\u2019s comments, calling them \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in an interview with Sky News. \u201cI think anybody who wants to stand to be a representative in our parliament should be really clear that whether it\u2019s Russian aggression on the battlefield, or online, that we stand against that aggression. That\u2019s standing behind Ukraine but also standing up for our freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are disgraceful comments, which reveal the true face of Nigel Farage: a Putin apologist who should never be trusted with our nation\u2019s security,\u201d wrote John Healey, a Labour MP and shadow Defence Secretary. He added that Farage has \u201cshown that he would rather lick Vladimir Putin\u2019s boot than stand up for the people of Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/europe/nigel-farage-ukraine-russia-eu-provoke-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

They say they plan to \u201coccupy\u201d parliament in\u00a0Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi.

The country\u2019s interior minister has warned that demonstrations must end by sunset or 6.30 p.m local time, whichever is earlier. Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindami has addressed the media in Nairobi, urging protesters to remain peaceful and warning against the destruction of property. \u201cProtesters must not obstruct, block, vandalize, or otherwise destroy any private or public property,\u201d Kindami said at a media conference in Nairobi.

{"id": "2024_06_23_middleeast_intense-phase-hamas-war-end-netanyahu-lebanon-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the \u201cintense phase of the war with Hamas (in Gaza) is about to end,\u201d and that the military\u2019s focus could then shift to Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon, where fighting with the Iran-backed group Hezbollah has intensified in recent weeks. Netanyahu, however, vowed that Israel would continue operating in Gaza until the militant group Hamas was eliminated. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the war is going to end, but the war in its current stage is going to end in Rafah. This is true. We will continue mowing the grass later,\u201d Netanyahu told Channel 14 Television in his first one-on-one interview with local Israeli media since October 7. More than a million Palestinians were taking shelter in Rafah before Israel started its air and ground operation in the southern Gazan city, defying calls from the international community not to proceed. Around 800,000 people have since been displaced from Rafah, where conditions have been described by the United Nations food agency as \u201capocalyptic.\u201d The city\u2019s border crossing\u00a0with Egypt \u2014 a vital entry point for humanitarian aid \u2014 has remained closed since the Israeli military seized it early last month. And international pressure on Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza have mounted since it started its operation in Rafah. Last month, the UN\u2019s top court ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation there, calling the humanitarian situation \u201cdisastrous.\u201d Netanyahu also weighed in on the ongoing negotiations to end the war, saying he was ready to make \u201ca partial deal\u201d with Hamas to return some hostages still being held captive in Gaza, but reiterating his position that the war will still continue after a ceasefire \u201cto achieve the goal of eliminating\u201d Hamas. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to give that up,\u201d Netanyahu said. Netanyahu\u2019s comments were at odds with the aims of a broader proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last month. That plan, which the US has said is an Israeli one, sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces. Israeli opposition politician Gadi Eisenkot said Netanyahu\u2019s remarks about a \u201cpartial deal\u201d contradicted the wishes of the country\u2019s recently-disbanded war cabinet, of which Eisenkot was a member. \u201cA deal in one step, the so-called \u2018all for all,\u2019 or a complete deal in three steps. The cabinet voted unanimously on this. That\u2019s why the Prime Minister\u2019s statement about a partial deal is against the war cabinet\u2019s decision,\u201d Eisenkot told the Knesset Foreign Affairs Committee on Monday. \u201cI think this requires clarification in light of the turmoil it causes to the families of the hostages.\u201d Eisenkot, who \u2013 along with centrist opposition figure Benny Gantz \u2013 resigned from the war cabinet the week before Netanyahu dissolved it, said the remarks had damaged Israel\u2019s war objectives. \u201cThe damage is of course the failure to realize the goals of the war, and it is a fatal damage to the national strength of the State of Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are soldiers who are fighting now because they have war goals to return the hostages and therefore I think that an immediate clarification by the Prime Minister is required as to what he meant.\u201d In a short statement issued after his interview Sunday, Netanyahu\u2019s office sought to clarify his comments, saying Hamas opposes a deal, not Israel. \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu has made it clear that we will not leave Gaza until we return all 120 of our hostages, living and deceased,\u201d it said. Seeking to row back his explosive comments even further, Netanyahu on Monday told the Knesset: \u201cWe are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden welcomed. Our position has not changed.\u201d The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters condemned any suggestion of a withdrawal without securing the return of all hostages. \u201cThe end of the fighting in the Gaza Strip, without the release of the hostages, is an unprecedented national failure and a failure to meet the goals of the war,\u201d the Forum said in a statement on Monday. The prime minister has faced nationwide protests in Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the return of all hostages. On Saturday, families of the hostages took part in the ongoing\u00a0anti-government\u00a0protests, including in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Herzliya, Caesarea, Raanana, Be\u2019er Sheva, Kiryat Gat\u00a0and the town of Pardes Hanna-Karkur. Many protesters demanded the government accept the hostage release deal. Cracks also appear to be deepening between the Israeli government and its military. Netanyahu has come under increasing\u00a0pressure\u00a0from members of his\u00a0government\u00a0and Israel\u2019s allies, including the United States, to devise a strategy for the post-war governance of Gaza after Israel\u2019s devastating bombardment of the isolated enclave. In response to the prime minister\u2019s comments, Hamas said the words used by\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0show that he is only looking for a partial agreement and not an end to the war in Gaza. Netanyahu\u2019s positions are \u201ca clear confirmation of his rejection of the recent Security Council resolution, and the proposals of US President Joe Biden,\u201d Hamas said in a statement. Hamas continues to insist that any agreement include, \u201ca clear affirmation of a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\u201d Shifting north Netanyahu also told Channel 14 Television that \u201cafter the end of the intense phase, we will have the possibility to shift some of the power north, and we will do it.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, for protection purposes, and secondly, to bring our residents home as well. If we can do it politically, that would be great. If not, we will do it in another way, but we will bring everyone back home \u2013 all the residents of the north and the south,\u201d he added. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, has been carrying out deadly attacks from southern Lebanon targeting areas in northern Israel since October 8, the day after the Hamas attacks on Israel. Israel has responded to Hezbollah\u2019s attacks with strikes that have killed Hezbollah militants, among them senior commanders. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from their homes in northern Israel due to ongoing conflict. Villages across southern Lebanon have also emptied. The increase in cross-border attacks in recent weeks has intensified concerns about the possible outbreak of another full-fledged conflict in the Middle East. Israeli officials have told the US they were planning\u00a0to shift resources from southern Gaza to northern Israel in preparation for a possible offensive against the group, US officials told CNN on Wednesday. The implications of a wider war between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah could be devastating, a senior US official previously told CNN. US officials have serious concerns\u00a0that in the event of a full-blown war between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah, as the Iran-backed militant group could overwhelm Israel\u2019s air defenses\u00a0in the north \u2014 including the much-vaunted\u00a0Iron Dome\u00a0air defense system. Netanyahu was also asked in the interview if his solution to ending the conflict with Hezbollah was via agreement or war. The prime minister responded, \u201cLook, if there is an agreement, it will be an agreement according to our terms. Our terms are not ending the war, leaving Gaza, and leaving Hamas intact. I refuse to leave Hamas intact. We need to eliminate them.\u201d Israel launched its war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages. Since then, the Israeli campaign has killed more than 37,000 people, according to the ministry of health in Gaza.

Going out to play involves hiking back up 15 flights of stairs carrying her now 17 kg (37 lb) child. They tend to take a ball instead of a bicycle for those days, she jokes. Without power, there\u2019s no water, so she has to schedule her child\u2019s baths around the blackouts. But sometimes they occur outside of the scheduled times. Keen to provide hot meals each day to a toddler who doesn\u2019t always eat them, she now has a gas camping stove in her kitchen, and a small battery to power the microwave. Serzhan\u2019s resilience masks a deepening crisis in Ukraine. These are not the first rolling blackouts since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, but they are the first to happen in the spring and early summer \u2013 traditionally the months with lowest electricity demand before air-conditioning season kicks in \u2013 underscoring the scale of the supply problem. In the early hours of Thursday morning, Ukraine endured the seventh massive Russian attack on its energy facilities since March 22 this year. Ukrenergo, the state-owned grid operator, reported damage in four regions. Seven energy workers were injured, and previously scheduled power outages extended. On Saturday, \u201cmassive\u201d Russian missile attacks hit several Ukrainian energy facilities, leaving thousands without power, officials said. In the Zaporizhzhia region, two power engineers were injured and the energy facility was damaged overnight, according to Ivan Fedorov, the head of Zaporizhzhia\u2019s regional military administration. Ukraine\u2019s energy grid has been firmly in the crosshairs of Russian missiles since the war began but this year Moscow began specifically targeting power generation facilities \u2013 thermal power plants, hydroelectric power stations, even energy storage facilities \u2013 a marked shift in tactics from the previous winter, when the attacks were less precise, and the damage easier to repair. Experts say Russia has been using better weaponry and taking advantage of thin Ukrainian air defenses. At Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction conference in Berlin in mid-June, President Volodymyr Zelensky laid out the scale of the destruction from the first six attacks. \u201cRussian missile and drone strikes have already destroyed 9 GW of capacity, while the peak energy consumption in Ukraine last winter was 18 GW. So, half of it does not exist anymore,\u201d he said. Officials and energy executives are now acknowledging there is no way to avoid blackouts this winter. The mission now is simply to minimize them. \u201cIf we don\u2019t restore the existing the damaged plants, if we don\u2019t improve the interconnector capacity for input, if we don\u2019t build these distributed generators, at least in some places\u2026 then people will have power for less than four hours per day,\u201d says Dmytro Sakharuk, executive director of DTEK, Ukraine\u2019s largest private energy company. \u201cWe have 120 days left before the start of the heating season,\u201d he warns. \u201cIt cannot be business as usual.\u201d Ukraine is trying to tackle the problem in a variety of ways.\u00a0As well as rebuilding what they can, in some cases using parts from decommissioned power plants in Europe, officials and energy companies are trying to secure as many generators and gas turbines as possible to support critical infrastructure through the winter, and are working with European partners to increase imports of electricity. Before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine was a net exporter of electricity, and had even been able to resume some exports during wartime.\u00a0That stopped in March. \u201cWe are doing our best,\u201d Deputy Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk told CNN. \u201cWe understand that without energy it will be very difficult to survive.\u201d When supply-side efforts fall short, all that\u2019s left is to reduce demand. And that means asking for even more sacrifice from the already blackout-weary Ukrainian people. \u201cWe asked our people\u2026 to be ready to understand the situation, to support Ukraine, to support our energy workers,\u201d says Grynchuk. \u201cWe call it the second front line, energy.\u201d At the end of April, a few weeks after a Russian attack destroyed the Kyiv region\u2019s biggest power plant, Andrii Buzovskyi, a 52-year-old Kyiv police officer, spent about $1,400 on two solar panels for his balcony. \u201cI installed them so that my family would not feel uncomfortable when there is no electricity,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWhat will happen next is unknown.\u201d The government would like to see more of this. Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal just announced new grants to help housing cooperatives invest in solar panels and heat pumps. Ukraine\u2019s central bank is also working to make loans for households and businesses to buy energy-related equipment more affordable. In her Kyiv high-rise, Serzhan is pursuing a different kind of energy independence. She is so worried about braving freezing temperatures in her apartment this winter, she\u2019s looking to rent a small house outside Kyiv with a wood-burning stove. \u201cIt\u2019s like the 19th century,\u201d she admits. Companies are doing their part. Ukrainian Railways has revised the schedule for 74 suburban trains (about 7% of the total), temporarily suspending some services.\u00a0The company told CNN it\u2019s also halted the use of air conditioning in administrative buildings, and turned off outdoor lighting. The chief executive of supermarket chain Auchan Ukraine, Marta Trush, told CNN that while all its stores are already equipped with generators, it has modernized its refrigerators to save energy and reduced its range of products with short sell-by dates.\u00a0Some of that has the added incentive of mitigating soaring costs. \u201cThe operation of the entire network on diesel generators is about three times more expensive than from the central power grid,\u201d said Trush. \u201cSo, to save electricity in the sales areas, we reduce lighting and temporarily restrict access to refrigerators, but we see how customers are understanding of the forced measures.\u201d Power outages have a clear inflationary effect, said Igor Piddubnyi, a researcher at the Kyiv School of Economics. \u201cCompanies have to have to somehow get back-up power supply and they are\u2026 buying the diesel generators, solar panels, etcetera\u2026and it increases the cost of production,\u201d he told CNN. Ukraine\u2019s inability to export electricity also upsets its balance of trade, he says, which feeds into inflation. The National Bank of Ukraine estimated in May that economic growth will slow to 3% this year, from 5.3% in 2023, mostly because of the damage to the energy sector. Inflation is expected to rise slightly to 8.2%. And while Russia is experiencing a wartime uplift for its labor force, with unemployment at record lows, Piddubnyi said evidence shows power outages are forcing Ukrainian companies to lay off workers. The central bank still expects unemployment to fall this year, but only to 14% from the current level of 15%. It is painful situation, said Piddubnyi. \u201cUkraine really loses a lot, but also the problem is that Russia is still gathering huge profits from exporting oil and gas.\u201d The Kyiv School of Economics estimated last month that rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s damaged energy infrastructure would cost $50.5 billion, factoring in new measures to improve its resilience against further attacks. That\u2019s the equivalent of the entire hard-won loan backed by the profits of frozen Russia assets Ukraine was recently promised, but it may not see that money for months.\u00a0 The G7, having already spent $3bn to date to support Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, just announced another $1bn in funding in early June. And Piddubnyi points out that calculating the true cost of rebuilding, while attacks continue, is impossible. \u201cThere is a clear uncertainty of how many more power plants will be destroyed by Russians,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s energy ministry says it has been building concrete shelters to protect some energy equipment from attacks. But more advanced air defense systems are the only way to protect entire power plants and prevent the reconstruction bill from spiraling higher. In the wake of Thursday\u2019s attack, Kyiv\u2019s intensive lobbying efforts finally looked to be paying off. Romania agreed, after months of deliberation, to send a Patriot air defense system to Ukraine.\u00a0And a senior White House official told CNN that Ukraine was being given top priority for US shipments of advanced air defense capabilities, ahead of some other countries.\u00a0Those deliveries should start this summer. Sakharuk, who spoke to CNN before the seventh wave of strikes on energy facilities on June 20, said he would like to see deliveries of air defense munitions specifically to protect energy facilities. He admits keeping up morale among employees is a major challenge.\u00a0\u201cThey see that they are in a type of cycle where they repair an energy facility and Russia finds out that it\u2019s being repaired, and (it is) again destroyed.\u201d \u201cIn some cases, the workers did this three to four times already.\u201d CNN\u2019s Clare Sebastian wrote and reported from London, and Olga Voitovych reported from Kyiv.

The blackout \u2014 which affected hospitals, homes, and a major subway system \u2014 was caused by maintenance and transmission issues in the country\u2019s electrical system, authorities said. \u201cThe outages we had today were due to a lack of investment in maintenance, new electrical transmission, and the protection of the electrical transmission infrastructure,\u201d Public Infrastructure Minister Roberto Luque told a news conference on Wednesday. As of Wednesday night, energy had been restored in 95% of the country, according to the government. Ecuador has been struggling with an energy crisis for years. The latest saw Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa declare an energy emergency in April and order eight-hour nationwide power cuts amid a drought that affected power generation. In the\u00a0capital\u00a0city of\u00a0Quito, a CNN team saw two hospitals, including a children\u2019s medical center, lose power during\u00a0the blackout.

More than 1,300 people died on this year\u2019s Hajj with \u201cnumerous cases\u201d due to heat stress, according to Saudi Arabian authorities, after more than 1.8 million pilgrims took part despite temperatures soaring to dangerous levels. Authorities in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country, said at least 215 Indonesians are among the dead. Speaking to CNN on Sunday,\u00a0Heru Jumartiyah said\u00a0her 86-year-old father, Ngatijo Wongso Sentono, died on June 17\u00a0in his tent in\u00a0Mina, southeast of Mecca, as he waited for midday prayers. \u201cHe was asleep and had no symptoms of sickness before. Everyone said he was healthy during the\u00a0Hajj\u00a0procession,\u201d she said. Sentono had registered for the Hajj in\u00a02018 and traveled to\u00a0Mecca\u00a0with his 83-year-old wife and neighbors from the\u00a0Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, Jumartiyah said. \u201cMy father was very enthusiastic about going on the\u00a0Hajj.\u00a0He\u00a0wanted to leave immediately,\u201d she\u00a0said. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. According to Islamic belief, to die and be\u00a0buried\u00a0in\u00a0Mecca\u00a0is considered to be a blessing, with many Muslims traveling\u00a0in\u00a0their old age after having saved for many years to make the\u00a0pilgrimage. \u201cWe are happy that he was buried in Mecca,\u201d Jumartiyah said, adding that she hoped to visit her father\u2019s grave when she eventually makes the pilgrimage. Jumartiyah said her mother, Pariyem Prawirodinomo, is\u00a0healthy and due to return to Indonesia on July 7. Some 241,000 Indonesian pilgrims were scheduled to make the journey to Mecca this year, according to Indonesian officials \u2013 the country\u2019s largest ever quota. According to data from the\u00a0Indonesian\u00a0Ministry of Religious Affairs, most of the Indonesians who died on the pilgrimage this year were over age 50. It is not uncommon for Indonesia to register hundreds of deaths during each year\u2019s Hajj \u2013 last year, 773 people died during the pilgrimage, according to records from the ministry. \u2018I saw many pilgrims who died\u2019 Extreme heat has been named as a main factor behind the hundreds of deaths and injuries reported this year during the Hajj. Mecca, the holy city that is central for Hajj pilgrims, saw temperatures soar to a record 125 degrees Fahrenheit (51 Celsius) on Monday. Various authorities have also said the problems have been compounded by the number of unofficial pilgrimages, with the Saudi government saying Sunday that \u201cunauthorized\u201d trips accounted for more than four out of five of the fatalities. Saudi Arabia requires each pilgrim to acquire one of the 1.8 million available licenses to legally access Mecca. These licenses can cost several thousand US dollars. Unlicensed pilgrims typically don\u2019t travel in organized tour buses with air conditioning or easy access to water and food supplies. As part of the pilgrimage, the faithful perform a series of rituals in and around the holy city of Mecca, often involving many hours of walking in the scorching heat every day. Some pilgrims have lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of this year\u2019s Hajj. Even pilgrims on official tours spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in the heat. Some\u00a0witnesses have told CNN\u00a0of how they saw worshipers losing consciousness and walked past bodies covered in white cloth. A 44-year-old Indonesian man who only wished to be referred to as Ahmad, recalled seeing many dying from the heat. \u201cAlong the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom (white fabric) cloth.\u201d \u201cEvery time there is a distribution of water from local residents or certain groups, it is immediately overrun by the pilgrims,\u201d he added, saying that he didn\u2019t see health workers or a single ambulance along the road. In recent decades, the sheer size of Hajj crowds has been a factor in a number of deadly incidents during the pilgrimage, including a stampede that killed hundreds of people in 2015. However, experts have warned that rising temperatures pose the deadliest threat to pilgrims as heat records tumble in the Middle East \u2013 one of the most vulnerable regions to the climate crisis \u2013 making mass gatherings riskier. Climatologist and weather historian Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks extreme temperatures, told CNN that deserts in the region were \u201cwarming at night much faster than during the daytime,\u201d which was supposed to provide a break and relief from the heat. \u201cThis didn\u2019t exist until a couple of decades ago,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cEverybody is affected by deadly heat and sadly I am not surprised by (the Hajj) death toll,\u201d he added. \u201cSpending time outdoors in the extreme Mecca heat is risking death \u2026 so I am afraid there will be more deadly Hajj pilgrimages in the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/indonesia-hajj-heatwave-burial-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

They\u2019d spent $23,000 on an all-inclusive travel package through a tour company registered in the state of Maryland. \u201cThey saved their whole lives for this,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Fredricka Whitfield. But what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime turned tragic this week, when Wurie learned that her mother Isatu Tejan Wurie, 65, and father Alieu Dausy Wurie, 71, were among the hundreds of pilgrims who have died during the extreme temperatures that have gripped the Persian Gulf country. More than 500 have been confirmed dead while there\u00a0are fears that\u00a0number is well above a thousand. The Wuries were American citizens from Bowie, Maryland. Mrs. Wurie had recently retired as a head nurse at Kaiser Permanente in Prince George\u2019s County, her daughter told CNN. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Whitfield on Saturday, Wurie said she had been in close contact with her parents while they were in Saudi Arabia via a family group chat. It was in that chat, she said, that she learned that the tour company did not provide the proper transportation or credentials needed to participate in the pilgrimage. The group her parents were traveling with, which included up to 100 fellow pilgrims, lacked sufficient food and supplies for the five-to-six-day journey that is a pillar of Islam, she said. Wurie believes her parents were not \u201cproperly prepared\u201d for the trip by the tour operator\u00a0and \u201cdid not receive what they paid for\u201d from the company. CNN has reached out to the tour company for comment. She last heard from her parents on Saturday, June 15, when her mother messaged that they had already been waiting for transportation for hours to take them to Mount Arafat. She believes they were located in Mina at the time. The couple ultimately opted to walk instead and sent a message to their daughter after they had been walking for over two hours. The couple then joined fellow pilgrims and others in their tour group on Mount Arafat, where they were gathering to pray and reflect on the holy site. A man on their tour group contacted Saida Wurie to say that her parents had gone missing on Mount Arafat, after her father said\u00a0that he could not continue on the journey and stopped for a break along the way. The man had continued to the top of Mount Arafat but could not find the couple upon his descent. Wurie received death notifications from the US Consulate in Jeddah, which had obtained them from the Saudi Interior Ministry, saying her parents had died of \u201cnatural causes\u201d on June 15. She was later advised by someone at the US Embassy that heat stroke would be considered a natural cause. The Consulate General\u2019s Office told her that her parents had already been buried, but have been unable to tell her exactly where. Now, Saida and her brothers are doing everything they can to get answers and find their parents\u2019 burial\u00a0place. \u201cWe did ask the Saudi government to hold the bodies in order for us to travel to Saudi Arabia to at least give them the proper burial with [their] children being present and to be able to identify the bodies,\u201d she told Whitfield. \u201cUnfortunately, they have already been buried.\u201d \u2060She would like\u00a0American diplomats to meet her and\u00a0her siblings\u00a0on the ground when they arrive to assist them in finding where their parents are buried and collecting their belongings, since she does not know Arabic and is not familiar with the area. As of Saturday, diplomats have not committed to meeting them in person in Saudi Arabia, she said. The US State Department confirmed there had been \u201cdeaths of multiple US citizens in Saudi Arabia,\u201d but declined to comment on any specifics around the Wurie family. Extreme heat has been named as a main factor behind the hundreds of deaths and injuries reported this year during the Hajj. Mecca, the holy city that is central for Hajj pilgrims, saw temperatures soar to a record-setting 125 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday. High temperatures for this year\u2019s gathering had been expected, with the Saudi army deploying more than 1,600 personnel with medical units and 30 rapid response teams specifically for heatstroke. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers were also on duty. But CNN has spoken to other Hajj\u00a0pilgrims who said the preparations weren\u2019t enough, with one describing seeing fellow worshipers lose consciousness and walking past bodies covered in white cloths. The exact death toll remains unclear and is expected to rise, as countries around the world have been independently announcing the deaths of their nationals. Concern over improper tour groups has also grown. Egypt announced it was revoking the licenses of 16 travel agencies that organize Hajj trips\u00a0on Saturday, according to the state-run news agency Ahram Online. This isn\u2019t the first time hundreds of pilgrims have died while traveling for the Hajj, which this year attracted more than 1.8 million people.\u00a0In 2015 more than 700 people were killed\u00a0during a stampede in the Saudi Arabian city of Mina, just outside of Mecca. In 2006, 363 people were killed during a stampede at the site where pilgrims gathered to participate in the \u2018stoning of the devil\u2019 ritual in Mina.\u00a0Last year, more than 200 people died.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/middleeast/american-deaths-hajj-heat-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_europe_conservatives-election-related-gambling-scandal-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s governing Conservative Party has been rocked by a gambling scandal in the middle of the campaign for an election that it is expected to lose. The UK\u2019s PA Media news agency reported on Thursday that Conservative candidate Laura Saunders is facing a gambling watchdog investigation into alleged betting offenses. The BBC reported that Saunders in being investigated for placing a bet on the timing of the general election, which is due to take place on July 4. Prior to standing as a candidate, Saunders worked for the Conservative Party. UK media outlets also reported that she is married\u00a0to Tony Lee, the Conservative Party\u2019s director of campaigning. Lee is also being investigating by the Gambling Commission over an alleged bet relating to the date of the general election, according to the BBC. He is now taking a leave of absence from his role, with just two weeks until the vote. Saunders has declined to comment on the matter. A Conservative spokesperson told CNN in a statement: \u201cWe have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn\u2019t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\u201d Saunders is the second Conservative candidate being looked into by the UK\u2019s Gambling Commission. Craig Williams, who worked as an aide to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in parliament, is alleged to have placed \u00a3100 ($127) on the election taking place in July just three days before the prime minister officially made the announcement. Williams told the BBC last week:\u00a0\u201cI clearly made a huge error of judgement that\u2019s for sure and I apologize\u2026 I will not be expanding on (my) statement because it\u2019s an independent process \u2026 The Gambling Commission are looking at it now.\u201d The story became worse for Sunak on Wednesday, after it was reported that a police officer working on the prime minister\u2019s security staff was also being looked into. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: \u201cThe matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met\u2019s Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties.\u201d The official opposition Labour Party has said the scandal is just the latest example of the Conservative Party\u2019s pattern of cronyism, in reference to the way that lucrative government contracts were handed to people associated with the Conservative Party during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cIt stinks. And the public will come to their own conclusions. It\u2019s not a good look,\u201d a Labour source told CNN. In another sign of the Conservatives\u2019 disjointed campaign, the party had on Wednesday posted a video on its official X account, warning voters not to \u201cbet on Labour.\u201d The video showed a spinning roulette wheel and ended with a campaign slogan: \u201cIf you think Labour will win. Start saving.\u201d But, after allegations emerged that their staff had placed bets on the date of the election, the Conservatives deleted the post Thursday. Sunak and the Conservatives have been polling behind Labour since November 2021 and as things stand the Conservatives are expected to suffer a historic defeat on July 4. It would be the first time Labour has entered power from opposition since 1997 and would end 14 years of controversial government by the Conservative Party. Final results will not be known until July 5. If Sunak does lose the election, he will leave office the same day.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/europe/conservatives-election-related-gambling-scandal-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_middleeast_naama-levy-birthday-israel-hostage-intl-latam", "text": "Thousands of people gathered in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday to commemorate the 20th birthday of Naama Levy, who has been held captive for 260 days. It was one of the first and most searing viral videos to emerge as the October 7 attack unfolded. A cell phone video released by Hamas shows Levy, who was 19-years-old at the time, being dragged by her hair at gunpoint by a terrorist in Gaza. Her hands are bound, her ankles cut. Her pants are soaked in blood. Eight months on, and Levy is one of 120 people who remain in captivity in Gaza, 116 of whom were among the more than 250 taken hostage on October 7. A hostage and ceasefire deal in November secured the release of more than 100, while a handful have been rescued. But fears for those who remain are growing, with a senior Hamas official telling CNN recently that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many of them are still alive. Their plight is the subject of regular anti-government protests in Israel, where many demonstrators are calling on Israeli leaders to secure a hostage deal and hold an early election. At Hostages Square on Saturday, Levy\u2019s parents Ayelet Levy Shachar and Yoni Levy addressed the crowd. \u201cToday, I didn\u2019t want to make a speech in the square. I just wanted to wish Naama a happy birthday, to speak to you, Naama, hoping you might hear, wishing these words reach you,\u201d Levy\u2019s mother said during her speech. \u201cI \u2026 wish for you the most basic right that you deserve as a human being \u2013 your freedom, which was taken from you eight and a half months ago,\u201d her mother added. Levy\u2019s father, Yoni, said he wished his daughter could see how many people showed up to celebrate her birthday. \u201cI remember your laughter and can hear your voice, imagining exactly what you\u2019d be doing today. We would have prepared a table for you, full of sweets, balloons, and gifts. Like every year,\u201d Yoni said during his speech at the gathering. \u201cHow happy this day could have been. Instead, you\u2019re there. In darkness. For 260 days already. And we stand here,\u201d Yoni added. \u201cWe all understand that 120 hostages cannot be returned through military operations. We must honestly say \u2013 120 hostages will only return home through a deal,\u201d Yoni said. Yoni also addressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly, saying, \u201cVictory in war is not just victory in military battles. And it\u2019s not just preserving the coalition at any cost. Victory in war is the ability to preserve the values of this nation, years ahead. And victory is the ability to continue being faithful to our values as Jews and Israelis.\u201d The gathering in Hostages Square was just one of several that took place in cities across Israel on Saturday Families of hostages held in Gaza also took part in protests in Jerusalem, Herzliya, Caesarea, Raanana, Be\u2019er Sheva, Kiryat Gat and the town of Pardes Hanna-Karkur. Many waved Israeli flags and held up signs with images of the Israeli hostages. \u201cAlive! Alive! And not in body bags!\u201d, \u201cHostage deal now! Bring them back alive now! The baby, the soldiers, the women, the men,\u201d protesters in Tel Aviv shouted. Other protesters were heard shouting, \u201d Elections now.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing more important, every hostage must return!\u201d protesters in Jerusalem chanted. In Caesarea, thousands of protesters took to the streets chanting, \u2018You\u2019re the leader, you\u2019re guilty!\u2019 In the town of Pardes Hanna-Karkur, protesters also called for the release of all hostages and an early election to be held. Some of them were heard chanting, \u2018We will not give up until we make it a better place to live.\u201d Former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz took part in a hostage rally in Carmei Gat in Kiryat Gat city with members of Kibbutz Nir Oz. Nir Oz was one of several kibbutzim\u00a0that bore the brunt of Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7, with many residents murdered or taken hostage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/middleeast/naama-levy-birthday-israel-hostage-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_weather_heat-wave-new-york-washington-dc-weekend", "text": "A dangerous heat wave is bringing sweltering temperatures to much of the US this weekend, including over parts of the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, a tropical system could develop this weekend through the southwest Gulf of Mexico. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022\u00a0Millions of Americans under heat alerts: More than 100 million Americans, including those in the highly populated I-95 corridor, are under heat alerts through the weekend. A heat emergency is in effect for Washington, DC, where the temperature skyrocketed to 100\u00ba F, the first time the city has recorded a temperature that high since 2012. \u2022\u00a0Tropical system could develop: A new tropical system could develop quick this weekend on the heels of Alberto. A system with a medium chance of tropical development could mimic Alberto\u2019s track through the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and into northeastern Mexico this weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center. While this system is not expected to be as large as Alberto, it could bring more rain to South Texas and trigger new flooding concerns there and along the Gulf Coast. \u2022\u00a0Sizzling temperatures return to California: Heat alerts in California span parts of southern and central California, including in Colusa County, where firefighters are working to rein in the Sites Fire spanning over 19,100 acres. High temperatures between 100 and 106 are expected and could hinder firefighting efforts. California is seeing an active\u00a0early fire year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Since the start of the year, more than 89,700 acres have burned, compared to 5,747 acres during the same period last year. \u2022\u00a0\u2018Catastrophic flooding\u2019 in Iowa: On Saturday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties in northwest Iowa and directed all available state resources to assist Rock Valley and other communities in response to \u201ccatastrophic flooding.\u201d In Rock Valley, all residences north of Highway 18 were being evacuated amid high floodwaters. There\u2019s a level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Saturday over northern Iowa, and that corner of the state has seen an estimated 10-plus inches of rain based on radar. The heaviest rain is expected further east. And in nearby Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people have been rescued in the past 24 hours from rising water due to heavy rainfall, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith. \u2022 Flood threat in fire zone: A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning and more rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods. \u2022 Search for \u201cmore loss of life\u201d in New Mexico fires: In New Mexico, authorities reported\u00a0that at least two people\u00a0died, 1,400 structures were destroyed and more than 8,000 residents were evacuated as a result of\u00a0wildfires. The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for \u201cmore loss of life.\u201d The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. Ruidoso residents will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and authorities ask that they bring at least a week\u2019s worth of food and drinking water, as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Meanwhile, FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires. Heat wave to intensify and expand this weekend More record daily high temperatures are possible through the weekend as heat expands into new areas and intensifies in others. The extreme heat and humidity will combine to push the heat index \u2013 or how hot it feels \u2013 to 100 to 105 degrees over a widespread area, with 110 degrees possible in the southern mid-Atlantic. Record overnight low temperatures will\u00a0increase health risks\u00a0by reducing the ability for people to cool down at night. The nation\u2019s capital could potentially hit 100 degrees for the first time in eight years. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said an extended\u00a0heat\u00a0emergency will remain activated throughout the weekend and into next week. The National Weather Service said widespread temperatures in the upper 90s and even triple digits will be possible in the city. The city officially recorded a temperature of 100 degrees Saturday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Thursday signed a state of preparedness declaration ahead of the potentially hazardous\u00a0heat\u00a0wave. An\u00a0excessive\u00a0heat\u00a0watch\u00a0has been issued for most of the region for Saturday, according to the National Weather Service, with dangerous\u00a0heat\u00a0possible and the\u00a0heat\u00a0expected to feel between 105 and 110 degrees. The heat wave\u2019s prolonged nature is a serious concern. New York City residents could experience 90-degree temperatures or higher this weekend into early next week. The stretch would be the longest ever in June in the city. For the first time this year, the National Weather Service has issued a\u00a0heat\u00a0advisory\u00a0for the city. Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday announced the opening of the state\u2019s emergency operations center, which she said will monitor conditions and share resources with emergency management personnel across the state\u2019s 62 counties. Earlier this week, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said cooling centers will be open across the city. Philadelphia has extended a heat\u00a0health emergency through midnight on Sunday, according to the state\u2019s Department of Public Health. Philadelphia has\u00a0heat\u00a0alerts in place through the weekend, with temperatures expected to feel close to 99 degrees. New Jersey\u2019s\u00a0heat\u00a0alerts are in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.\u00a0It will feel around 100 degrees across the state Saturday and Sunday. Heat is also returning in full force in the West following a brief break. Heat alerts are already in place for portions of California, Arizona and Utah. Temperatures are expected to jump back up to 10 to 15 degrees above normal for Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Bakersfield, California, through the weekend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/weather/heat-wave-new-york-washington-dc-weekend/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-arrests", "text": "Turks and Caicos is revising part of its firearms law that recently caused legal trouble for several Americans carrying ammunition into the British Overseas Territory, House of Assembly member Edwin Astwood said in a statement\u00a0Friday. The revision comes weeks after a bipartisan US congressional delegation traveled to the islands asking for charges to be dropped for five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. It is a crime to bring firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police. The amendment passed by the House of Assembly on June 14 clarifies that in sentencing for firearms-related offenses, courts have the discretion to impose either a fine, a custodial sentence, or a mixture of both in exceptional circumstances, the statement read. Previously, the law mandated courts to impose both a fine and a prison sentence of 12 years, although it allowed reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d \u201cThe amendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity. This often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender,\u201d Astwood said. The mandatory minimum has not changed from 12 years, according to Sheena C. Mair, a lawyer for Sharitta Shinese Grier, an American awaiting trial.\u00a0The only change is if the court finds exceptional circumstances allowing the departure from the mandatory minimum of 12 years, they can impose a custodial sentence or a fine or both. Bryan Hagerich, one of the five Americans\u00a0arrested\u00a0for carrying ammunition, is\u00a0back\u00a0in the\u00a0United States\u00a0after receiving a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine.\u00a0Hagerich\u00a0was allowed to leave the\u00a0territory\u00a0and return to the US once he paid the fine, his attorney Oliver Smith said. Tyler Wenrich\u00a0previously pleaded guilty to similar charges and\u00a0was sentenced to time served\u00a0and issued a $9,000 fine, according to court records. Ryan\u00a0Tyler\u00a0Watson, another American awaiting his fate after being charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition,\u00a0is expected to be sentenced Friday, a little\u00a0under a month\u00a0after he pleaded guilty. Michael Lee Evans, a Texan in his 70s, who pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9mm rounds of ammunition,\u00a0was scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday \u2013 though it is unclear based on court records if the sentencing happened. CNN has reached out to his attorney for more information. Grier, a Florida mother, said she had no idea that two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. She was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly,\u00a0WFTV\u00a0reported. Grier is expected to appear in court to plead guilty on June 25, her lawyer said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/americas/turks-and-caicos-ammunition-arrests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

At least 55 people have died since June 9, Chinese state media reported Friday, with dramatic footage showing urban areas submerged in water and buildings appearing to subside\u00a0as emergency responders in speedboats raced to rescue stranded residents. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Friday that at least 47 people have died in the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province, among the hardest hit places amid reports of record flooding along the banks of the Songyuan and Shiku rivers. The southern Guangdong province is an economic powerhouse home to 127 million people and is subject to annual flooding from April to September. But the region has faced more intense rainstorms and severe flooding in recent years as scientists warn the climate crisis will amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent. Earlier in the week, more than 10,000 people were evacuated from Meizhou, and as many as 130,00 were left without power, with authorities in the city raising the flood control emergency response to Level-I, according to state media. China\u2019s flood control emergency response system has four levels, with Level-I being the most severe. Of those, 38 were reported dead in the city\u2019s Pingyuan county and two people were reported missing, CCTV reported, adding that over 55,000 people have been affected by the heavy rainfall and the direct economic loss is estimated to be about 5.8 billion yuan ($799 million). In the nearby southern province of Fujian, state media reported at least eight people had died, including four in Wuping county and the rest in Shanghang county, adding that heavy rainfall has affected an estimated 586,500 people across 40 counties. And in Guangxi, a neighboring southern region to the west, state media reported 48 rivers were running above flood alert levels, forcing authorities to introduce a Level-II emergency response. The Lijiang River, a famous and popular tourist destination that runs through Guilin, saw its worst flooding since 1998, resulting in more than 6,000 people being evacuated, state media reported on Thursday. The emergency response to the flooding comes as Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for all-out efforts to safeguard lives and property, as China grapples with extreme weather with heavy rains in the south and severe drought and record temperatures in the north. Other parts of China are also facing earlier and longer extreme heat periods and droughts each year, causing widespread power shortages and disruptions on food and industrial supply chains.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/china/southern-china-flooding-deaths-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_middleeast_marjayoun-lebanon-israel-border-war-fears-intl-hnk", "text": "In the town of Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, around five miles north of the Israeli border, the main square seems almost abandoned. A few men play billiards in a storefront nestled in a building crowned with life-sized statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Charbel, a revered Lebanese saint. They don\u2019t want to talk about the wars and rumors of war that for decades have plagued this predominantly Christian town near the border. Journalists are a bother, one grumbles, and goes back to the game. On the other side of the square, a woman in her thirties comes out of a grocery store with a small bag. \u201cMarjayoun is very nice, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d the woman, Claude, tells me. \u201cBut the shelling scares us.\u201d That\u2019s all she wants to say. Throughout the day, occasional thuds of incoming and outgoing fire echo through the streets. Tensions between Israel and Lebanon have risen sharply since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing military campaign by Israel in Gaza. The Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has been firing missiles, mortars and drones into Israel, and Israel has returned that fire. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the mountainous border have fled as concerns intensify about the possible outbreak of another full-fledged war. On the Lebanese side, residents of Shia-majority towns like Kafr Kila, Adaisa, Aita\u00a0Al-Shaab and Aitaroun have almost all left. Frequent Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages have reduced many of these communities to rubble. Marjayoun, in comparison, has been mostly spared. The town was the headquarters of the Israeli-armed and funded South Lebanese Army (SLA), a Christian-led proxy militia, during Israel\u2019s decades-long occupation of southern Lebanon, which ended 24 years ago after a protracted guerilla war with Hezbollah. When Israel pulled out in 2000,\u00a0many of Marjayoun\u2019s inhabitants fled south across the border to Israel, fearful of being accused by fellow Lebanese citizens of being collaborators with Israel. Their departure, along with Lebanon\u2019s collapsed economy, fear of yet another prolonged conflict, the absence of a functioning state and emigration have sapped Marjayoun of people and prosperity. Yet, more than two decades later, some residents still cling to their ancient town and vow not to leave. \u201cI feel this area has a geographical curse. There has always been tension,\u201d Edouard Achy told me. \u201cThe threats are coming from both sides of the border. Tensions are increasing day by day. Everything points to something about to happen.\u201d Is he going to leave, I ask. He shrugs. \u201cAfter more than eight months of this situation, people just want calm and quiet,\u201d he says. His sister, Amal, and her family have come to church to say a special prayer to mark 40 days since her mother died. Dressed in black with a crucifix around her neck, she brought large loaves of bread and bags of buns to share with the congregation. Amal exudes a strong connection with her hometown, but wonders how much longer it will be safe as the clouds of war gather overhead. \u201cWe\u2019re staying put, and God willing, we\u2019ll continue to stay,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThe south is the Holy Land. The Messiah tread here two thousand years ago.\u201d She paused and sighed. \u201cBut if things escalate to war and it reaches here like it did before, with some shelling, of course, like others, we\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d she said. \u2018In war, everyone loses\u2019 Half an hour away, in the mostly Druze town of Hasbaya, 85-year-old Abu Nabil sweeps the street outside his shop. The Druze faith is an offshoot of Islam, with adherents found in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Jordan. A pious man with a gentle smile and a bushy white moustache, he looks on the bright side of life. \u201cThe Lord is merciful to us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can sleep in our homes. We eat. We drink. No one goes hungry.\u201d Since his birth, Abu Nabil saw Lebanon gain its independence from France in 1943, prosper during the 1960s, become engulfed by civil war, invaded and partially occupied by Israel for decades, and partially occupied by Syria, also for decades. He has seen the country emerge from civil war, embroiled in war again with Israel in 2006, wracked by a string of high-profile assassinations, convulsed by a short-lived revolution in 2019, followed by economic collapse, and now once again, on the brink of full-scale war with Israel. \u201cWar is ruinous,\u201d he says, grasping my hand. \u201cIn war, everyone loses, even the winner.\u201d Across the street, young men drink coffee from small paper cups while smoking cigarettes. They don\u2019t want trouble, they say, declining to be interviewed. The worry here, and in many parts of Lebanon, is that if you speak out against Hezbollah, there could be a price to pay. Some people do, some politicians do, but when Hezbollah lives nearby, it\u2019s best not to take the risk. \u201cGaza is not my war, and I don\u2019t want to pray in Jerusalem,\u201d one of the men insisted. Another said one of reasons not one Israeli missile, bomb or artillery round has landed in Hasbaya is because young men act as a sort of armed community watch, making sure no one, neither Hezbollah nor Hamas, fires anything at Israel. It\u2019s not their turf and they\u2019re not welcome here, they say. Down the hill, there\u2019s a traffic jam on the road leading out of Hasbaya west towards Marjayoun. Cars crawl at a snail\u2019s pace, drivers sticking their heads out to see what it\u2019s all about. A large group of men, women and children stand around a new white stone building, all dressed in their best. Parked in front is a shining white convertible, the bonnet covered with bouquets of flowers and a license plate reads, in English, \u201cNewly Married.\u201d A group of men arrives in traditional Druze clothing\u2014with small turbans, vests and low-crotched trousers\u2014carrying drums and horns. As people leave the building, musicians strike up a raucous tune with a heavy beat and high notes, while others twirl prayer beads over their heads. The bride, Fatin, in a long lacy dress, and the groom, Taymour, emerge into the sunlight, and everyone cheers. I decide not to interfere with annoying questions about Israel, Hezbollah, impending war, death, destruction and displacement. Everyone is happy, enjoying the bright June afternoon, the noise, the presence of friends and relatives. \u201cWhy spoil such a beautiful day?\u201d I think. Looking at the festivities, you\u2019d never guess that Israeli forces are only about five miles away and that, not far from here, deadly projectiles are being hurtled back and forth across the border. The irony, however, was not lost on one man, who leaned over with a chuckle, \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating here while war is around the corner.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/middleeast/marjayoun-lebanon-israel-border-war-fears-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Video shows the man lying across the front of the Israeli jeep as it drove through a neighborhood of Jenin. The man appeared\u00a0slumped\u00a0on the hood of the vehicle as it drove past Palestinian Red Crescent\u00a0(PRCS)\u00a0ambulances. The PRCS said the Israeli military had prevented its crews from providing first aid to an injured man in the Jabarat area of Jenin. \u201cThey then placed the injured person on the front of a military jeep and detained him before later allowing our crews to transfer him to the hospital,\u201d the PRCS said. The man\u2019s condition and identity are unknown. In response to questions about the incident,\u00a0the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)\u00a0said Saturday that its forces violated \u201corders and standard operating procedures\u201d and an investigation would be launched. \u201cThe conduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the values of the IDF. The incident will be investigated and dealt with accordingly,\u201d the IDF said in a statement. The IDF said the incident happened Saturday morning during counterterrorism operations to apprehend suspects in the Wadi Burqin area west of Jenin. It said the man was a suspect who was injured and apprehended after an exchange of fire. He was transferred to the Red Crescent to receive medical treatment, the Israeli military added. There has been an uptick in violence\u00a0in the occupied West Bank since the start of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza began in October, following the militant group\u2019s unprecedented and deadly attacks on Israel. More than 500 Palestinians, including over 100 children, have been killed in the West Bank since October 7, according to the United Nations\u00a0Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\u00a0(OCHA). Almost three quarters of those fatalities took place during operations by Israeli forces, the UN agency said. As well as Israeli military raids in the West Bank, there has been an increase in violence carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians. More than 700,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in settlements that are considered illegal under international law and widely seen as one of the main obstacles to a two-state solution. Last Friday, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on the Israeli group Tzav 9 for disrupting humanitarian convoys headed to Gaza, the latest punitive measure taken under an executive order targeting those perpetrating violence in the West Bank.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/middleeast/west-bank-jenin-israeli-military-palestinian-man-jeep-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
