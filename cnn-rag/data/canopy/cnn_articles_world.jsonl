The plane has the capacity to hold up to 339 passengers, according to Air Europa\u2019s website. One of the passengers, Evangelina Saravia, told the Uruguayan news outlet Teledoce that there had been about 20 minutes of mild turbulence before the plane suddenly dropped 400 meters at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour \u2013 catching some passengers, who had ignored the seatbelt warnings, off guard. \u201c(Before the drop) there were people walking, people without belts. There were children sleeping without belts,\u201d Saravia said. \u201cPeople were thrown from the seats and hit the ceiling, that\u2019s why the ceiling broke,\u201d she added. Another passenger, Daniel Monta\u00f1ez, told CNN he and his wife had been sleeping with their seat belts on when the turbulence hit and awoke to see some of their fellow passengers hitting the ceiling of the cabin and falling back down. \u201cPeople who did not have their seat belts unfortunately suffered consequences, injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were people broken, people on the floor, people screaming, people who felt bad, people bleeding \u2026 A rather chaotic image. As you can imagine, the nerves at that point start to play after you come to your senses about what happened, because at that moment you don\u2019t really notice anything, only movements and madness.\u201d Another passenger, Stevan, told Reuters: \u201cThere are passengers with fractures and injuries to their arms, faces, and legs. There are about 30 people injured. It was a pretty horrible feeling; we thought we were going to die there, but thank God it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The Spanish airline said that another plane was set to depart later on Monday from Madrid and pick up the passengers stranded in Brazil to continue their journey to Uruguay. Air Europa those passengers in need of healthcare were treated in Brazil\u2019s Natal International Airport. A second Air Europe flight picked up some of those diverted to Brazil and took them to Montevideo, Uruguay, their original destination, according to an Air Europa post on X. The passengers arrived in Montevideo on Tuesday morning at 07:20 a.m. local time, according to Air Europa. The airline added in a post on X that they \u201cregret what happened and the inconvenienced caused.\u201d Air Europa also said that some personnel have traveled to Natal to support the passengers that continue to receive medical assistance. The news comes as the latest development in a string of bad publicity for the airplane manufacturer Boeing. While there\u2019s no evidence so far that the injuries on the Air Europa flight had anything to do with a safety malfunction, Boeing has recently faced a series of whistleblowers alleging safety issues at the company. Just last week,\u00a0a whistleblower came forward alleging parts\u00a0of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes were built in an unsafe manner \u2013 potentially leading to \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, said he found and reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing\u00a0halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners\u00a0while it looked into the gaps. Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process and deliveries ultimately resumed. More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since a\u00a0door plug blew off a 737 Max plane\u00a0in January just after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side the plane. The FAA has opened multiple investigations into Boeing and the US Department of Justice said it\u00a0may file criminal charges\u00a0against the company because of its ongoing quality and safety failures.

{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up. I do everything possible to make sure that I achieve my objectives and achieve the vision for which I started this organization.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

Fresh protests dubbed \u201cOne Million People March\u201d began Thursday, with demonstrators calling for roads leading to the capital Nairobi to be blocked. Others threatened to occupy the State House, the president\u2019s office,\u00a0and the official residence. In a surprise move on Wednesday, Ruto said he would not sign the finance bill, saying he had been \u201clistening keenly\u201d to the Kenyan people. He had been facing escalating protests over the bill, with a civil society organization saying at least 23 people had died in clashes. But so far his move has failed to quell the demonstrations. Security forces have set up roadblocks around routes leading to the State House while other parts of the capital city have been fortified with heavy police presence. \u201cIt\u2019s more than about the finance bill now,\u201d Maria, a Kenyan protestor from Nairobi told CNN. \u201c(They\u2019re) killing us as young people for what? We come in peace,\u201d she added. Despite being billed as a \u2018million people march,\u2019 turnout was noticeably lower in Nairobi\u2019s central business district, a CNN team observed. The heavy security presence within the city deterred a crowd from forming with police shouting at protesters to \u201cgo home\u201d in Swahili. What the largely youthful protesters now want varies. Some have called on President Ruto to resign for failing to withdraw the unpopular bill much earlier to save the lives lost. Others are seeking justice for the deceased protesters and demanding the recall of lawmakers who voted in support of the finance bill. \u201cI want them to listen to me,\u201d another protester told CNN. Civic groups such as the Law Society of\u00a0Kenya\u00a0are calling for the removal of\u00a0Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and Nairobi\u2019s regional police commander after officers were accused of reportedly shooting dead protesters. Kenya, East Africa\u2019s dominant economy, has grappled with escalating living costs that have spiked food prices and other commodities. The nation also owes billions of dollars in foreign and local debts, spending a sizeable chunk of its revenue repaying its creditors. \u201cI am not going to preside over a bankrupt country, I am not going to preside over a country that is in debt distress,\u201d President Ruto said last month while defending his plans. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern about a \u201csignificant shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s \u201ctax revenue collection\u201d while urging its government to consider measures to shore up its earnings to reduce borrowing. The bill proposed levies on locally produced products, such as diapers and sanitary towels, including taxes on motor vehicles, and\u00a0mobile money transfer fees, among others. Last week, Ruto shelved some of those taxes, but Kenyans remain angry, and called for the bill to\u00a0be\u00a0scrapped completely. International financial ratings\u00a0agency\u00a0Moody\u2019s warned that scrapping the bill \u201cwill create a revenue shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s budgeting. Ruto warned of spending cuts across government financing if the tax measures were withdrawn. Ruto\u2019s leadership is now being tested like never before. His ability to navigate this period of unrest will be critical not only for his political survival but also for the stability of\u00a0Kenya. The ongoing protests suggest that mere policy reversals may not be sufficient. Analyst Herman Manyora, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi,\u00a0told CNN the\u00a0president\u00a0may need to engage in more substantial reforms to restore faith in his administration. \u201cThe way forward is for the president to go a little more than he has done now in order to get the goodwill of the people,\u201d Manyora said. \u201cHe needs to reshuffle his cabinet and economic advisers which will send a signal that will create the goodwill required. At that point, a government-led conversation can take place.\u201d Ruto, whose rise to the presidency was largely propelled by youth voters said in his address retracting the finance bill that he hoped to engage with young people in the country to listen to their ideas and proposals on how to solve the nation\u2019s economic challenges. But that won\u2019t come easy, Manyora said. \u201cThey (young people) feel betrayed.

The snap vote, called by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is being held months earlier than necessary and caught much of his party by surprise. The opposition Labour party suffered its worst defeat since 1935 in the last general election, but has since rebuilt itself under the leadership of Keir Starmer. Thursday\u2019s vote follows a six-week campaign in which all major parties have scoured the country in search of votes. Much of the debate has revolved around the economy, the cost of living, the state of Britain\u2019s public services, and tax and immigration. Largely absent from the debate, however, has been Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union, which it left in 2020 after a referendum four years earlier. Britain has had three Conservative prime ministers since the last general election in 2019, which Boris Johnson won by a landslide. But after much of the country and his party soured on Johnson, Conservative party members voted in 2022 to replace him with Liz Truss, who became the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) then voted to replace her with Sunak. During the campaign, Nigel Farage \u2013 one of the most prominent champions of Brexit \u2013 announced his return to frontline politics to lead the nascent hard-right Reform UK party.

{"id": "2024_07_03_europe_france-election-nakamura-opposes-far-right-intl-latam", "text": "France\u2019s most streamed singer Aya Nakamura has joined the chorus of voices calling on the French electorate to vote against the far right in Sunday\u2019s high stakes election. The National Rally party, which is slated to win big in this Sunday\u2019s second round of voting, has drawn criticism and concern from French celebrities of dual nationality, worried about the impact of their immigration policy plans. The party, headed by 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, hopes to restrict dual nationals from accessing certain state jobs. It also wants to strip citizenship rights from those born to foreign parents on French soil. Popstar Nakamura, who immigrated to France from Mali as a child and rose to fame with her smash hit song \u201cDjadja,\u201d made the call in a social media post on Tuesday that zeroed in on her own experiences of racism in France. The 29-year-old  said in her post that she is \u201cwell placed to understand and know the place of racism in our country.\u201d Nakamura said that although she had previously chosen not to weigh in on certain issues, she now understood that her role as a major musical artist requires her to \u201cspeak out\u201d during such an \u201cimportant moment.\u201d She called on her fans to vote against \u201cthe only extreme to be condemned,\u201d in what appeared to be a reference to the far right. In a separate post, Nakamura directly referenced the National Rally party, saying: \u201cF*** the National Rally.\u201d Nakamura later deleted the post, according to reporting from CNN affiliate BFMTV. Nakamura herself is no stranger to threats from the far right, having previously found herself at the center of a controversy earlier this year when speculation mounted that she would perform the classic French song \u201cJe ne regrette rien\u201d at the Olympics opening ceremony. Far-right fringe groups and politicians, including Marion Mar\u00e9chal, a far-right lawmaker and niece of Marine Le Pen, complained that Nakamura does not even \u201csing in French.\u201d This swipe was seemingly a reference to the blend of French and African slang that Nakamura uses in her lyrics. France\u2019s top sports stars have also been using their platforms to urge the public not to vote for the far right. Jules Kounde, a 25-year-old French Beninese national who plays on the French national team, used a press conference during the Euros tournament to share what he called his own \u201cpolitical position.\u201d \u201cI was disappointed to see the direction France is taking, with strong support for a party against our values,\u201d Kounde told journalists after the match between France and Belgium on Monday. \u201cI believe it\u2019s important to block the extreme right, the National Rally, because this party will not lead our country towards more freedom.\u201d Kounde\u2019s remarks echo comments from fellow football star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who told journalists earlier during the tournament that he is \u201cagainst extremes.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9, whose family originally came from Algeria and Cameroon, stressed that he didn\u2019t want to \u201crepresent a country\u201d that didn\u2019t embody his \u201cvalues.\u201d The French far right\u2019s strong showing in the first round has prompted concern from several European countries and even top United Nations officials.

The KC-130 Hercules transport aircraft touched down on the 6,000-foot runway on June 22 in what a Marine Corps press release called \u201ca significant and triumphant return to this iconic World War II site.\u201d Marine engineers had been working on rebuilding the runway for months, clearing brush, removing trees and ensuring no unexploded ordnance remained from the World War II battle on the island, which is part of the island country of Palau. More than 1,500 US troops and nearly 11,000 Japanese were killed on Peleliu between August and November of 1944, according to the US Naval History and Heritage Command, which noted that some Japanese troops hid in the island\u2019s jungle and weren\u2019t found until two years after World War II ended. One US unit, the 1st Marine Regiment, suffered 70% casualties in six days of fighting on the island. The Marines named the rebuilt landing strip the \u201cSledge\u201d runway in honor of a veteran of the Peleliu battle, Pfc. Eugene Sledge, a mortarman on the island who wrote about it in a memoir \u201cWith the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa,\u201d and whose memories were portrayed in the HBO miniseries \u201cThe Pacific.\u201d Sledge described Peleliu as \u201can alien, unearthly, surrealistic nightmare like the surface of another planet.\u201d Now the runway \u201cbridges the past and the future, honoring WWII sacrifices while enhancing regional security and cooperation,\u201d the Marine Corps release said. That regional security has been largely focused on China in recent years, which the Pentagon identifies as its \u201cpacing threat.\u201d Part of mitigating the threat has been building facilities where the US could disperse assets like aircraft in the event of hostilities, including in the so-called Second Island Chain, locations far enough away from the Chinese mainland that Beijing would have difficulty striking targets there. The First Island Chain, in such places as Okinawa in Japan, and US bases in the Philippines, \u201cis neither a survivable nor viable operating location due to Chinese military capabilities in long-range bombers, cruise missiles, and theater ballistic missiles,\u201d US Air Force Lt. Col. Grant Georgulis wrote in a 2022 commentary posted on the US Defense Department website. \u201cThus, the United States should prioritize Midway Island, the Marianas, Palau, and the Marshall Islands to complement an already fortified Guam,\u201d Georgulis wrote. China has been deeply critical of Washington\u2019s alliance-building efforts in the Pacific, viewing them as an attempt to halt Beijing\u2019s rise as a military and economic superpower. Beijing has long felt boxed in by the US presence in the First and Second Island Chains and under leader Xi Jinping has become much more assertive in regional waters and confrontational with neighbors such as Japan and the Philippines. It has also sought to boost its own diplomatic and security ties across the Pacific region. \u201cIn a bid to protect its hegemony, the United States is forming blocs globally to target specific countries, provoke confrontation and destabilize the world,\u201d China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news agency wrote in a recent editorial. \u201cIt claims to protect its allies under mutual defense treaties, but in reality, the treaties serve as a tool to subordinate them to the superpower and push them to the forefront of conflicts.\u201d Reviving airfield used by US atomic bombers Meanwhile, on Yap island in the Federated States of Micronesia, midway between Guam and Palau, the US Air Force in its 2025 budget requested $400 million to extend the runway at the island\u2019s international airport \u2013 also a former Japanese military airfield \u2013 so it can be used by US military aircraft. The US is already performing work on other locations in the Second Island Chain, including reviving North Field on Tinian island in the Northern Marianas, from where the US bombers that dropped the atomic bombs departed in August 1945. \u201cThe United States must focus like a laser on the need for air superiority in the Pacific region. The United States must recapitalize islands gained during World War II to form a Second Island Chain of strategic expeditionary points,\u201d Georgulis wrote. For Washington, establishing strong ties to Pacific island states is also seen as a way to keep China from gaining footholds in the region. The Biden administration has signed a bilateral defense agreement with Papua New Guinea and reopened an embassy in the Solomon Islands since the beginning of 2023. Palau is a remote archipelago of coral and volcanic islands in the western Pacific and home to about 20,000 people. Since 1994, Palau has been covered by a compact of free association with the United States, making Washington responsible for its defense needs and allowing Palauans to serve in the US military. Palau last year signed a bilateral law enforcement agreement with Washington that will let the US Coast Guard enforce its laws in its exclusive economic zone without a Palau officer present. US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro visited Palau\u2019s capital of Koror in March as part of a Pacific trip that included stops at two key US allies, Japan and South Korea, during which he said Washington\u2019s partnership with the island state \u201cdirectly supports a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d \u201cI can assure you that the United States remains committed to Palau\u2019s national security,\u201d Del Toro said during a trip that also included a visit to the Peleliu island runway work. Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. has been critical of China\u2019s increasingly assertive moves in the region, including toward Taiwan. Palau is one of the few remaining countries to diplomatically\u00a0recognize Taiwan over Beijing. Along with the runway, US Marines are helping make improvements to the Peleliu Civic Center Museum, to house artifacts from the World War II battle. At an event last month marking the landing of the Marine aircraft on Peleliu, island Gov. Emais Roberts thanked the US Defense Department for its efforts there. \u201cOur small island community has benefitted immensely with the US Marine presence. We value the great partnership, and we feel safe and protected with the support of the greatest country in this world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/asia/us-military-rebuilds-runway-peleliu-palau-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Princess Royal, 73, had been injured while walking near horses at the royal estate, in Gloucestershire, western England, on Sunday evening. Anne will continue to rest and recover at home, returning to public engagements when her medical team recommends it is safe and comfortable to do so, the source told CNN. Her husband Vice-Adm. Tim Laurence expressed his gratitude to the medical staff for their care. He said in a statement, \u201cI would like to extend my warmest thanks to all the team at Southmead Hospital for their care, expertise and kindness during my wife\u2019s short stay.\u201d The exact circumstances that led to the Princess Royal\u2019s injuries were not clear but there were horses in the vicinity and previously her medical team said that her head injuries were consistent with a potential impact from a horse\u2019s head or legs. Emergency services were sent to the estate and, after medical care at the scene, she was transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol for appropriate tests, treatment and observation. CNN understands the princess has not been able to recall the details of what happened on Sunday evening due to her concussion. While it\u2019s not known how long the princess will be convalescing for, she will be receiving rehabilitation support at home as she follows standard concussion protocols. Anne is widely considered to be one of the hardest working royals, dutifully undertaking hundreds of engagements each year. She is one of several senior royals that stepped up further to support the King when he briefly stepped away from public-facing duties following his cancer diagnosis. The five-day hospital stay caused the princess to miss several engagements this week, including a state banquet at Buckingham Palace held for the emperor and empress of Japan on the first day of their state visit to the United Kingdom. She had also been due to travel to Canada for a royal visit this weekend. Her accident is the latest in a series of health challenges the family has faced since the new year, with her brother Charles and the Princess of Wales continuing their cancer treatments. Sarah Ferguson,\u00a0Duchess of York was also diagnosed with malignant melanoma in January. This story has been updated.

According to Turkish state news agency Anadolu, a Syrian man was arrested on allegations that he sexually abused his seven-year-old female cousin, who is also Syrian, in a public bathroom at a market. Reports of the purported abuse quickly spread across social media, prompting outraged local residents to riot \u2014 setting fire to cars and Syrian-run businesses in the central Anatolian city. \u201cAn investigation was immediately launched on the issue. However, later our citizens gathered in this region, acted illegally in an attitude that does not suit our human values, and damaged houses, workplaces, and vehicles belonging to Syrian nationals,\u201d Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. He said that dozens of people were detained, and the crowd was only dispersed in the early morning hours. The local governor of Kayseri called on people \u201cto act calmly, with moderation and common sense.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed opposition parties, some of which have taken a hard line on removing the estimated 3.6 million Syrians from the country, for stoking \u201chatred politics.\u201d Erdogan himself has pledged to create the conditions for large numbers of Syrians to voluntarily return to Syria. \u201cXenophobia and hatred towards refugees in our country should not be ignited because this does not give any positive results,\u201d he said in a speech on Monday. The riots in Kayseri also sparked backlash inside Syria. Video from the town of Atareb, which is currently under the control of Turkish troops, showed people chanting against the Turkish army\u2019s presence and throwing things at an armored vehicle. Another video showed the chaotic situation that followed, with plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots. A local resident told CNN troops had used a smoke grenade and fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd. CNN cannot independently verify the resident\u2019s account. In another town, Ghazawiah, also in northwest Syria, protesters were seen pulling the Turkish flag town from a military site. A local resident there confirmed to CNN that the incident took place. At the \u201cBab al-Salama\u201d border crossing with Turkey, the Turkish flag was removed, burned and replaced with a Free Syrian Army flag, according to a local resident and images circulating on social media. Several internet providers in northern Syria appeared to be disconnected late Monday. Only satellite internet was still working. The largest umbrella group representing the Syrian opposition, the \u201cNational Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces\u201d released a statement urging Syrians on both sides of the border to \u201cexercise self-restraint.\u201d \u201cThe sole beneficiaries of this chaos, violations, and disorder are the regime and terrorist organizations,\u201d the statement read. Yerlikaya blamed bots and provocateurs for sowing discord on social media. He said that more than a third of accounts sharing content about the events in Kayseri on X were bots and that 10 accounts had been referred to prosecutors. \u201cWe will not tolerate those who threaten the peace and security of our country, make provocative posts, or engage in hate speech,\u201d he wrote on X. Turkey hosts more Syrian refugees than any other country, but Turkey has often struggled to integrate Syrian refugees fully into society. That, combined with a struggling economy, has turned Syrians into a political lightning rod in Turkey. Many Syrians accuse Turks of racist treatment. Countless Syrian children are not in schools because of a requirement that Syrians remain in the districts they were registered in originally \u2014 even after events such as last year\u2019s deadly earthquake in southern Turkey forced many of them to relocate. All of this comes just days after Erdogan said he was open to meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to restore ties between the two countries \u2014 though last year Assad made clear the meeting could not take place so long as Turkish troops remained in Syria. Assad and Erdogan were once close and even vacationed together, but Erdogan eventually backed the Free Syrian Army that sought to oust Assad from power in Syria\u2019s civil war.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/world/turkey-riots-social-media-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

Israeli officials believe Hamas\u2019 latest response will enable the two parties to enter detailed negotiations to reach an agreement, the source said. A deal, however, is still not finalized nor is it assured. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must first green-light entering into that next phase of negotiations; and it will likely take several weeks of difficult negotiations to negotiate the details of a potential agreement, including the identities of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for Israeli hostages held by Hamas and the sequencing of releases. Israeli negotiators are set to meet with Israel\u2019s political leadership, including Netanyahu, over the coming days to decide whether to enter this phase of detailed negotiations. Hamas has confirmed that it passed a response on an Israeli proposal to mediators Qatar and Egypt, repeating its demand for a complete ceasefire. \u201cWe have put forward some demands that achieve securing access to a complete ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces,\u201d Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, told CNN on Wednesday.

In a statement, Taiwan\u2019s coast guard said the fishing boat, Tachinman 88, was intercepted by two Chinese coast guard vessels near the Kinmen islands, which lie just miles from the Chinese cities of Xiamen and Quanzhou. All five crew members were also detained, according to Taiwan authorities. China coast guard officers boarded the fishing boat and then escorted it to a nearby Chinese port,\u00a0the Taiwanese statement said, adding that three Taiwan coast guard\u00a0vessels answered a call for help but retreated to avoid conflict when they were outnumbered by their Chinese counterparts. China\u2019s coast guard confirmed it detained the boat, saying in a statement Wednesday that  its Fujian division had \u201clawfully boarded, inspected and detained a Taiwanese fishing vessel suspected of illegal fishing in the offshore waters near Quanzhou.\u201d China coast guard spokesperson Liu Dejun accused the Taiwanese boat of violating a summer fishing moratorium by operating trawl nets in a prohibited area and using nets with mesh sizes much smaller than China\u2019s national minimum requirements, thereby \u201cdamaging marine fisheries resources and the ecological environment.\u201d The Chinese statement did not mention the status of the crew members. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to unify with the island, by force if necessary. And Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taipei since President Lai Ching-te, who it openly loathes as a \u201cdangerous separatist,\u201d won the island\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party a historic third consecutive term in power in January. Meanwhile, tensions remain high in the waters around\u00a0Kinmen, a group of outlying islands controlled by Taiwan but nestled just a stone\u2019s throw from the shores of China. In a news conference Wednesday, a senior Taiwan maritime official\u00a0said the Taiwanese vessel was detained amid an annual summer fishing ban implemented by China\u00a0in May. Two Taiwanese and three Indonesian crew members were detained as the boat\u00a0operated 11.2 nautical miles from the mainland coast in China\u2019s territorial waters, said Hsieh Ching-chin, deputy director general of Taiwan\u2019s Coast Guard Administration. The Taiwan coast guard demanded the immediate release of the boat and crew. \u201cThe Coast Guard Administration calls on China not to engage in political manipulation, which undermines cross-strait relations, and it should release the Tachinman 88 vessel and its crew immediately,\u201d the Taiwanese statement said. China\u2019s coast guard has increased patrols in waters around Kinmen and other outlying islands controlled by Taiwan since February, when two Chinese fishermen were drowned while being chased by Taiwan\u2019s coast guard, who accused them of trespassing. In late February, Chinese coast guard officers intercepted and boarded a Taiwanese tourist boat for inspection, an unprecedented move that startled Taiwanese passengers. Taiwanese legislator Chen Yu-jen, who represents Kinmen for Taiwan\u2019s opposition Kuomintang party, said since then, fishermen in the islands had been careful not to cross into China\u2019s territorial waters due to Chinese coast guard patrols. \u201cBoth sides of the Taiwan Strait do not currently have a warm relationship, so we should be more careful about staying inside our own waters,\u201d she told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cIn the past, the coast guard would usually expel fishing vessels that crossed the maritime border, but now it is strictly enforcing the law.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/asia/china-detains-taiwan-fishing-boat-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_weather_hurricane-beryl-jamaica-caribbean-forecast", "text": "Hurricane Beryl, now a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm, has set its sights on Jamaica after leaving at least one person dead and inflicting ruin across entire islands in the Caribbean on Monday. The storm is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica on Wednesday and impact the Cayman Islands on Thursday, where a hurricane watch has been issued. The storm continues to smash records as it kicks off an exceptionally early hurricane season as the earliest Category 5 hurricane \u2013 and only the second Atlantic storm of such strength to be recorded in July. Beryl alarming strengthening has been fed by\u00a0abnormally warm ocean waters driven by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. It took only\u00a0minutes for Beryl to tear through Grenada on Monday, blasting through buildings and knocking out power and phone service to almost all of the island\u2019s residents, the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cIn half an hour, Carriacou was flattened,\u201d Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Monday. A path of \u201cimmense destruction, pain (and) suffering\u201d was torn through the neighboring nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where at least one person has been reported dead, said Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves. Parts of the islands, including hospitals, have no electricity and others are without water. About 90% of the homes on the nation\u2019s Union Island are damaged or destroyed, Gonsalves said. Hundreds more homes and several schools, churches and government buildings in St. Vincent also sustained severe damage. \u201cTomorrow we get up with our commitment and conviction to rebuild our lives and our families\u2019 lives,\u201d Gonsalves said Monday night. Though Beryl is likely to fluctuate in strength in the coming days, it is expected to remain an \u201cextremely dangerous major hurricane\u201d \u2013 Category 3 or stronger \u2013 through mid-week, the hurricane center said. The hurricane will continue packing strong winds, torrential rain and hazardous seas extending well beyond its center over much of the Caribbean. Even if Beryl doesn\u2019t make landfall in Jamaica, its outer bands will bring significant impacts. The latest on Beryl \u2022 Jamaica braces for severe impacts: A hurricane warning is in place for Jamaica, where hurricane conditions will impact the island on Wednesday. Tropical storm-force winds are expected earlier in the day on Wednesday. Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels and rainfall of 4 to 8 inches with isolated totals up to 12 inches is forecast. \u2022 Dominican Republic and Haiti under storm warnings: The southern coasts of Haiti and Dominican Republic remain under tropical storm warnings, with tropical storm conditions beginning Tuesday. Storm surge up to 3 feet is possible, and rainfall totals could reach 6 inches. \u2022 Extended state of emergency in Grenada: The order has been extended until July 7 due to the severe damage wrought by the storm, said Neila K. Ettienne, spokesperson for the prime minister\u2019s office. About 95% of the island of Grenada has lost power, she said. Telecommunications are also down and some individuals have lost internet service. \u2022 St. Vincent and Grenadines rush to restore power: Local authorities are \u201cworking feverishly, urgently and with great focus to get electricity in certain places tonight,\u201d Prime Minister Gonsalves said Monday. Many trees have collapsed on power lines. Even so, government buildings will reopen Tuesday and the prime minister urged business owners to open, if possible. \u2022 Huge blow to Barbados fishing industry: Though Barbados was spared from the brunt of the storm, large storm surge damaged numerous fishing vessels \u2013 a massive loss to the nation\u2019s fishing industry. At least 20 vessels have sunken, Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley said Monday. Some fishermen at the Bridgetown Fisheries Complex watched helplessly as violent waves slammed boats into each other or pulled them underwater, CNN affiliate CBC reports. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do than stand and watch total destruction \u2013 our livelihood gone down the drain,\u201d one resident told CBC. \u2022 Cricket team and fans stranded: Some cricket fans who had traveled to Barbados for the T20 World Cup \u2013 and even the winning Indian team itself \u2013 have been unable to leave the island as Hurricane Beryl forced the Grantley Adams International Airport to suspend operations. But the Indian team is likely to make its way home Tuesday after the airport\u2019s planned reopening, Mottley said.  Kicking off a far from normal hurricane season Beryl has shattered numerous records and is a troubling indicator that this season will be far from normal in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. On Sunday it became the earliest\u00a0major hurricane \u2013 defined as one that is Category 3 or higher \u2013 in the Atlantic in 58 years and the only one to reach Category 4 status in the month of June. It is also the strongest known hurricane to pass through the southern Windward Islands, which lie at the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea, according to data from NOAA that goes back to 1851. The hurricane was able to churn to life because the ocean is as warm now as it would normally be at the peak of hurricane season, said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and science advisor at nonprofit First Street Foundation. \u201cHurricanes don\u2019t know what month it is, they only know what their ambient environment is,\u201d Kossin told CNN. \u201cBeryl is breaking records for the month of June because Beryl thinks it\u2019s September.\u201d The ocean warm ocean temperatures fueling Beryl\u2019s unprecedented strengthening \u201ccertainly have a human fingerprint on them,\u201d Kossin said.

{"id": "2024_07_02_middleeast_israeli-military-orders-evacuations-in-southern-gaza-intl", "text": "The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders on Monday for areas in southern Gaza, including eastern Khan Younis and Rafah. This forced residents, many already displaced, to find new shelter, due to the suggestion of the possibility of another ground operation. The Gaza European Hospital in Khan Younis, one of the territory\u2019s last standing hospitals, is within the evacuation zone. It has transferred patients, including those in intensive care and babies in incubators, and medical equipment to other facilities \u201cin fear of bloodshed,\u201d according to the hospital\u2019s deputy director and doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s a chaotic scene and very difficult and dire,\u201d Dr.\u00a0Saleh al Hams, deputy director of Gaza\u00a0European Hospital in Khan Younis, told CNN. This is his third evacuation, he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Tuesday that staff at the hospital have performed more than 3,000 surgeries, treated hundreds of burn cases and provided physical rehabilitation to wounded people. \u201cAn ICRC team stayed in the hospital overnight, however the hospital is now unable to continue functioning effectively because so many staff members have evacuated, including medical, nursing, administration and support staff.\u201d The ICRC said they would now move their team and patients to the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah-Mawasi and, once conditions allow, staff will return to EGH and continue to work there. It said thousands of Palestinians have been displaced following the IDF evacuation orders, stressing there is \u201cno safe place\u201d in Gaza. Another ground operation in Khan Younis would underscore the difficulties faced by the Israeli military in trying to root out Palestinian militants from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew its ground forces from\u00a0the city\u00a0in April after months of fierce fighting that left much of it in ruins. After more than eight months of war, militants continue to hold dozens of Israeli hostages and fire rockets at Israel. Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted on Monday that the country\u2019s military is advancing to the \u201cend of the stage of eliminating\u201d Hamas\u2019 army in Gaza and will \u201ccontinue striking its remnants.\u201d He vowed that Israel would achieve its goals in war: returning the hostages held in Gaza as well as eliminating Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities. On Tuesday, the IDF said that about 20 projectiles were launched from the Khan Younis area toward Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip on Monday, adding that it struck targets in the area from which the projectiles were fired. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad said on Monday that it fired \u201ctargeted rockets\u201d at five Israeli communities close to the Gaza border. On Monday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reported that the emergency room at Al Amal Hospital in Khan Younis was overwhelmed with injuries after patients were transferred from the European Hospital following an Israeli military evacuation order for the Al Fukhari area. PRCS said the hospital also received patients from Nasser Hospital, which had similarly become overcrowded with patients from the European Hospital. In a separate statement, hours after the initial evacuation order, the IDF said the order \u201cdoes not apply to the patients in the European Hospital or the medical staff working there.\u201d \u201cThere is no intention to evacuate the European Hospital,\u201d the IDF statement added. Videos posted to social media showed hospital patients on stretchers being moved through nearby streets following the order. On Tuesday, Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson for the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, who is currently in Gaza, reported a \u201cmassive\u201d movement of people from the evacuation zones following the Israeli military\u2019s latest order. The agency anticipates that around 250,000 people will leave the evacuation zones after the latest order. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes and shelling on Khan Younis continued, with at least eight people killed and 32 injured overnight, according to Nasser hospital. Desalination plant Khan Younis is home to a UN-managed water desalination plant that supplies the city as well as Deir al-Balah and al-Mawasi, where scores of displaced Palestinians are residing. Gaza\u2019s clean water supply decreased significantly after desalination plants were forced to shut down following the siege imposed by the Israeli military in the wake of the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7. On Tuesday, COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for coordination with the Palestinian territories, and the IDF said in a joint statement that Israel would connect a new power line directly to the Khan Younis desalination plant to raise the production of drinking water to 20,000 cubic meters from 5,000. The UN estimated late last year that average water consumption in Gaza dropped to three liters per person per day. The World Health Organization recommends, in emergencies, a minimum of 7.5 liters to 15 liters of water per person per day for survival and hygiene.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/middleeast/israeli-military-orders-evacuations-in-southern-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

In 2022, Reuters reported that the appeals court had lowered Elder\u2019s sentence to 24 years, and Natale-Hjorth\u2019s sentence to 22 years. \u201cElder admitted killing Rega, but both he and Natale-Hjorth said they had acted in self-defense because they thought (Rega and another police officer) who were not in uniform were thugs out to get them after a botched attempt to buy drugs,\u201d the news agency reported at the time. Italy\u2019s highest Cassation Court ordered a new trial in 2023. \u201cThe decision rendered today has highlighted a legal qualification of the conduct on that tragic night that is certainly more in line with Finnegan\u2019s actual responsibilities,\u201d Renato Borzone and Roberto Capra, the Italian lawyers for the Americans, said in their statement. They added that the court had not yet given its reasoning for the verdict. However, they added that the court\u2019s recognition that, at the time of the incident, Elder could not have known Rega was a police officer, allows the case \u201cto be viewed quite differently.\u201d \u201cIt is regrettable that we have had to wait through five levels of jurisdiction to see recognized what the young American man has stated since his first interrogation,\u201d the joint statement said. Elder\u2019s father Ethan said in the statement that \u201cit should not be forgotten that this trial is connected to the tragedy of a person\u2019s death\u201d but he \u201cfelt it was right\u201d to bring out the \u201ctruth of the facts\u201d to help his son. \u201cFrom the very first moment, (Elder) stated that he did not understand that they were (policemen) and that he had reacted to a blocking attempt,\u201d Ethan said in the statement. \u201cBut he could not rest because no one believed him.\u201d \u201cI hope that while he will pay for his mistake, it will also open up hope for him in the future,\u201d the statement ends.

Slovak national railway company ZSSK said on a statement on Facebook that none of the more than 100 passengers on the EuroCity train died as it sent its condolences to \u201cthe families and loved ones of the bus passengers who were injured or lost in this accident.\u201d The emergency response continued into the night at the crash site in Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky, southern\u00a0Slovakia, the Slovak Emergency Medical Service said. Five ambulance vehicles and three ambulance helicopters are on the scene. Reuters footage from the scene showed smoke and fire billowing from a train carriage, with a person in the background heard saying: \u201cThere was just a big bang. Then the train stopped. We were able to get off, but the whole front part of the train was burning.\u201d The train was traveling from the Czech capital of Prague to the Hungarian capital of Budapest.

{"id": "2024_07_01_style_jesus-ai-artificial-intelligence-social-media-cec", "text": "AI images have become an unavoidable roadside attraction on Facebook and other social media, where dramatic and outlandish depictions of emotional scenes lure users into doling out likes, shares and \u201cAmens.\u201d Among the funhouse images of fake children crying in the street and police officers saving inexplicably huge Bibles from the rain, countless depictions of Jesus Christ seem to take up an outsized amount of AI real estate. It makes sense. The central figure of Christianity invokes potent reactions from billions of followers around the globe. For the last 2,000 years, faithful hands have labored to create likenesses of their professed savior, projecting onto him various theologies and mythologies combined with aesthetics of the time: Jesus suffering on the cross, Jesus as the Good Shepherd, Jesus the creator of miracles, Jesus the word made flesh, Jesus as cosmic judge. Now, in the age of AI, Jesus can assume an infinite variety of roles with just a few keystrokes. Jesus as a durian fruit, for instance. Or Jesus battling shirtless with Satan. Sometimes, Jesus is cuddling a person in need in a hospital bed, his chiseled features and strong hands providing divine comfort. None of these things are in the Bible, but they are alive in the minds of particularly imaginative Christians, or just those who want some easy engagement on Facebook. What\u2019s unsettling is how many AI-created images of Jesus are unnecessarily handsome and rugged, like one of those Instagram influencers who wears a lot of pendants and is always wandering barefoot through an island jungle. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, per se. The Bible doesn\u2019t get specific about Jesus\u2019 looks, and certainly artists over the millennia have taken creative license when it comes to his physique (and, to a different point, his skin tone). However, generative AI, like the kind that can create images from text prompts, doesn\u2019t work like an artist\u2019s brain. All of these handsome AI Jesus images are created from patterns a machine picks up from the information it is fed. What does that say about us, and how we view the figures most important to our cultural identities? The aesthetics of religious figures Since programs that generate AI art are trained on existing forms of art and imagery, the conundrum of handsome AI Jesus has two parts: How Jesus has been depicted in the images fed to such machines, and how the machines interpret the images they are given in order to spit out new ones. We\u2019ll start with the historical part first. \u201cDepicting religious figures in an idealized form far predates Christianity,\u201d says art historian and former classics professor Brenda Sanderson. \u201cGreeks and Romans portrayed their gods in a way that depicted strength and good health. While certain images of Jesus may not be intended to be sexual, they reflect a formal ideal that corresponds with the spiritual ideal.\u201d Sanderson also says some of these depictions merely reflect the sensibilities of the artist. The Sistine Chapel ceiling, painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512, is considered one of the crowning achievements of sacred art. While its vibrant frescoes illustrate saints, prophets and characters of the Bible, it also includes a full-on depiction of God\u2019s bare behind. \u201cThings like that that some may consider sacreligious today weren\u2019t quite as scandalous at the time,\u201d she says. The question of whether a religious depiction is \u201ctoo sexy\u201d doesn\u2019t stop with Jesus. A very famous pair of sculptures created for St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium in the 1800s has become a beloved part of art history lore. The first, \u201cL\u2019ange du mal,\u201d was created by artist Joseph Geefs, but was removed from the church because church officials worried about its effect on female worshipers and reportedly said, \u201cthe devil is too sublime.\u201d It was replaced by a different sculpture by Geefs\u2019 brother, Guillaume. However, in a humorous twist, many art lovers consider \u201cLe g\u00e9nie du mal\u201d to be even more suggestive than the original. Even today, the question of sexualized religious images in art is alive and well. In early 2024, a \u201csexualized\u201d painting of Jesus by Spanish artist Salustiano Garc\u00eda Cruz was decried as \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d by critics. \u201cBiblical figures and saints have often been made attractive or \u2018sexy\u2019 in art history, whether it\u2019s images of the scantily-clad young Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, the naked body of Mary Magdalene covered only by her hair, or the muscular torso of Christ in works by Michelangelo and others,\u201d art historian Morgan Haigh told the BBC about Garc\u00eda\u2019s work. How AI interprets art Now that we know there is a long history of humans depicting their religious figures in, well, idealized form, the prevalence of handsome AI Jesus makes more sense. Christopher Framer, a generative AI certified programmer from Petaluma, California, explains that different AI models are trained on different pieces of art, and the outcome relies on a person\u2019s input as well. \u201cFrom a consumer view you can\u2019t usually tell what kind of images an AI model has been fed, but what is generated can vary on other specifications like image type \u2014 does the person specify they want a photorealistic image? You see a lot of those on Facebook.\u201d Framer says other inputs can greatly vary the images, like the addition of words like \u201cstrong,\u201d \u201cfighting,\u201d or \u201cpower.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you for sure, but when people are looking to create images that elicit a specific response, they just need to add a single word or describe a situation, and that can create a huge difference.\u201d That\u2019s one reason why some depictions of AI Jesus include curious details, like tattoos, bulging biceps, hairy chests or soulful dreamboat eyes. \u201cThese programs don\u2019t actually know who Jesus is, or what he means. They know, through what they\u2019ve been fed, that most images of Jesus may look a certain way. Adding more into a prompt introduces more information into the image that may be at odds with what people think a religious image should look like.\u201d AI-generated images are becoming somewhat of a problem on social media, where engaging with a religious picture may take half a second and doesn\u2019t necessitate a close look at the content. Many AI photos of Jesus online also include elements of patriotism or politics, which, through Framer\u2019s explanation, alter the nature of the depiction. There are other complications that lead to the persistence of handsome AI Jesus. Some AI art experts fear the more AI images that are created, the more the programs that run them will create a kind of \u201cfeedback loop,\u201d where the same type of images get generated over and over again. These images attract thousands of likes and comments as people scroll by them, despite, at times, being very obviously manipulated. Many pages offering this kind of content also contain links to questionable websites, spam-like hashtags or repeated variations of the same type of image. All in all, it\u2019s not a very human experience. It makes sense that their posted images of Jesus feel a little inhuman, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/jesus-ai-artificial-intelligence-social-media-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England. In 1995, it was stolen from Longleat, the home of Thynne\u2019s descendants, and disappeared for seven years, before it was found at a bus stop in London by art detective Charles Hill.

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

Far right leader Wilders, the clear winner of last year\u2019s general election, will not be part of the government himself, but his shadow will loom large as he continues to lead his Freedom Party from parliament. Wilders, who was convicted for discrimination after he insulted Moroccans at a campaign rally in 2014, only managed to strike a coalition deal with three other conservative parties in May after he gave up his bid to become prime minister. Instead, the cabinet will be led by the independent and unelected Dick Schoof, a career bureaucrat who has led the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD and was the senior official at the ministry of justice. Schoof was put forward to alleviate concerns over Wilders\u2019 anti-Islam rhetoric among his main coalition partners, outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u2019s VVD and the centrist NSC. But Wilders, who has been living under tight security for 20 years due to Islamist death threats, has said he will not change his tone, and last week told his 1.4 million followers on social media platform X he still sees Islam as a \u201cdespicable, violent and hateful religion.\u201d He has selected hardliners from his party to represent him in cabinet, including several who in the past have claimed that the government was actively working on replacing the Dutch population with immigrants. The incoming government will have to stick to the agreement reached by the four parties, which aims for a clampdown on immigration and exceptions on EU asylum and environmental rules. Schoof and his team are expected to present detailed plans by September. They will not have much room to spend as the euro zone\u2019s fifth-largest economy saw its strong post-pandemic boom end in a recession last year. Unemployment is set to remain relatively low, but the coalition agreement is forecast to take the government\u2019s budget deficit close to the EU maximum of 3%. The new government will be the first since 2010 without Mark Rutte, who will become NATO\u2019s secretary-general in October.

{"id": "2024_07_02_china_china-russia-belarus-full-member-sco-summit-intl-hnk", "text": "A club of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia to\u00a0advance their leaders\u2019 vision of an alternative world order is set to expand again this week \u2013 this time adding a staunch Russian ally that has openly supported Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. The expected admission of Belarus to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) at its annual leaders\u2019 summit in Astana, Kazakhstan is another push by Beijing and Moscow to transform the grouping \u2013 from a regional security bloc into a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies. Belarus, which helped Russia to launch its 2022 invasion of Ukraine,\u00a0will become the latest authoritarian state to join the club, after Iran became a full member last year. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have arrived in Astana for the summit that begins Wednesday, in what will be their second meeting this year. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy,\u00a0is skipping the event, pointing to unease among some members about the direction the SCO is headed. Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years in line with Beijing and Moscow\u2019s shared ambition to counter what they see as US \u201chegemony\u201d and reshape the international system in their favor. In 2017, the bloc underwent its first expansion to welcome India and Pakistan. After adding Belarus, it will boast 10 members, representing more than 40% of the world\u2019s population and roughly a quarter of the global economy. It also has two observer states, Afghanistan and Mongolia, and more than a dozen \u201cdialogue partners\u201d from Myanmar to Turkey and the Arab states. The SCO\u2019s expansion comes after another bloc led by China and Russia, the BRICS group of major emerging economies, more than doubled its membership and significantly extended its global reach last year. Growing ambitions As the SCO grows in international visibility and economic weight, it has also broadened in geopolitical ambitions. The expected admission of Belarus, which borders the European Union,\u00a0\u201creally highlights how the SCO\u2019s mission has changed in the last few years,\u201d said Eva Seiwert, an expert on China\u2019s foreign policy at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) in Berlin. \u201cUnlike Iran, you\u00a0don\u2019t really get much like economic or security cooperation out of Belarus joining. And that\u2019s why I argue that it\u2019s more of a geopolitical move.\u201d With Russia deep in the third year of its grinding war against Ukraine, the SCO has become a crucial diplomatic avenue for Putin, as well as a platform to showcase he\u2019s not isolated internationally. And as\u00a0China\u2019s relations\u00a0with the US have plummeted, Beijing is now less concerned about the SCO being branded an anti-Western organization \u2013 a perception that has only deepened following Iran\u2019s admission, Seiwert said. \u201cThey want the SCO to be perceived as a major bloc that cannot be ignored anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWith all these countries joining, China and Russia (want to show they) both have a lot of supporters for their worldviews.\u201d And in that shared worldview, there is no place for the US in Eurasia. In a meeting with his senior foreign ministry officials last month, Putin laid out a future vision for \u201ca\u00a0new system of\u00a0bilateral and\u00a0multilateral guarantees of\u00a0collective security in\u00a0Eurasia,\u201d with the help of existing organizations like the SCO and a long-term goal to \u201cgradually phase out the\u00a0military presence of\u00a0external powers in\u00a0the\u00a0Eurasian region.\u201d \u201cDuring my\u00a0recent visit to\u00a0China, President Xi Jinping and\u00a0I\u00a0discussed this issue. It was noted that the\u00a0Russian proposal is not contradictory, but rather complements and\u00a0aligns with the\u00a0basic principles of\u00a0the\u00a0Chinese global security initiative,\u201d said Putin, who visited Beijing in May. Frictions and unease That big picture vison of an alternative future is going to be the \u201cheadline message\u201d for China and Russia coming out of this SCO summit, said Bates Gill, a senior fellow for the National Bureau of Asian Research. But the Belarus membership also creates big question marks that will hang over the organization, Gill said. \u201cIt creates all sorts of problems and new questions about the reputation, legitimacy and mandate of the organization, given the nature of the Belarus regime and its support for Russia\u2019s flagrant violation of international law and invasion of Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly the SCO can tolerate authoritarian regimes, but for the mandate of the organization, it further diversifies and dilutes its original focus, which was to be on Central Asia.\u201d The bloc\u2019s expansion hasn\u2019t come without frictions \u2013 notably with the admission of bitter rivals India and Pakistan \u2013 while tensions between Beijing and New Delhi have also flared in recent years following deadly clashes on their disputed Himalayan border. The grouping\u2019s increasingly anti-Western orientation following its embrace of Iran and now Belarus has also fueled unease among members that want to keep good relations with the West, including the former Soviet states in Central Asia. \u201cIn some respects, it puts the Central Asian states in a very awkward position,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThey are pursuing what they like to call multi-trajectory diplomacy. They don\u2019t want to be committed to only dealing with one major power, like Russia or China.\u201d Gill, who visited Central Asia in April and May, said there was an ambivalence in regional capitals about the future of the SCO. Modi is skipping India, too, appeared to be losing interest. Last year, it hosted the summit virtually \u2013 a muted arrangement that allowed Modi to avoid the optics of welcoming Putin and Xi to New Delhi as it sought closer ties with the US. This year, fresh from his third consecutive term inauguration, the Indian leader\u00a0is skipping the summit in Astana \u2013 despite Russian state media reports that he will visit the Kremlin next week. \u201cThis tells us that he does not see the SCO as the most effective channel through which to pursue Indian interests in this part of the world,\u201d Gill said. Even China, the main driver behind the SCO\u2019s expansion, is seeking a more direct way to engage with Central Asia \u2013 without Russia\u2019s involvement. Last year, five leaders from the region received a lavish welcome at the inaugural China-Central Asia summit in the Chinese city of Xi\u2019an, the starting point of the ancient Silk Road trade route that linked imperial China with civilizations to its west over a millennium ago.\u00a0In March, a permanent Secretariat for the China-Central Asia mechanism was established in the same city. And while China and Russia aspire to present the SCO as a counterweight to US-led institutions, it remains a much weaker and less cohesive bloc compared with the likes of NATO, the European Union or the Group of Seven nations. \u201cGiven the expansion of membership with India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus, the organization will be even less like an alliance or committed common grouping, and more like a strategic-vision type of organization \u2026 representative of a Eurasian identity,\u201d Gill said. After the summit in Astana, China is due to take up the rotating presidency of the SCO for a year. Seiwert, the expert at MERICS, said Beijing would work to find more common ground among member states. \u201cFor China, it\u2019s important that the SCO doesn\u2019t fail, that it is perceived as successful. I think they\u2019re also aware of all the difficulties that have come with all these different expansions,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it keeps on expanding \u2013 if Russia and China keep on pushing it to expand \u2013 then I think its regional relevance will really just diminish.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/china/china-russia-belarus-full-member-sco-summit-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_27_europe_france-parliament-election-explainer-intl-cmd", "text": "France\u2019s snap parliamentary election is one of the most momentous in decades, for both the country and the rest of Europe. Within two weeks, France could have a hard-left or hard-right government \u2013 or descend into political deadlock if no bloc wins a majority, leaving Paris hamstrung as problems mount at home and abroad. The election will take place over two rounds on June 30 and July 7. How will it work, who are the key players and what is at stake? How did we get here? Minutes after it was announced that his Renaissance party had been trounced in the European Parliament elections, President Emmanuel Macron called a snap national election \u2013 becoming the first president to do so since 1997. Renaissance had come a distant second, with less than half the votes won by the far-right National Rally (RN), the party of Marine Le Pen \u2013 and only marginally ahead of the left-wing coalition in third. Macron is not afraid of bold decisions. The first time he ran for elected office, under a party he had created only the year before, he became president. But even by his standards, this is a huge risk. \u201cIf his bet pays off, he\u2019ll go down as a brilliant strategist,\u201d Kevin Arceneaux, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris, told CNN. \u201cIf not, I think he will go down in history as somebody who essentially exploded the traditional party system in France, and\u2026 took a grenade to the institutions of the Fifth Republic.\u201d Why did Macron call an election? Macron\u2019s decision took even his closest allies by surprise. France\u2019s next elections were not scheduled until 2027. Politicians rarely call an election when their party trails in the polls and there is no need to do so. Analysts have parsed his potential motives. Although Macron was elected to a second presidential term in 2022, his party failed to win an outright parliamentary majority. To pass controversial bills like his pension reform, Macron has increasingly had to bypass parliament and resort to presidential decree, to the outrage of opposition parties and much of the public. One theory about why Macron called an election now is that France might soon have been forced to the polls anyway. Every time Macron passes a law by presidential decree, under Article 49.3 of the French constitution, the parliament can hold a vote of confidence in his government. With more spending bills slated for later this year, Macron\u2019s government may not have survived another of these. Perhaps he judged it is better to jump than be pushed. Another theory is that Macron is gambling that he can defeat extremist parties by exposing them to government. With Le Pen seeming increasingly likely to succeed him as president in 2027 \u2013 when Macron will be unable to stand for a third term \u2013 this election may force her party to take up responsibility beforehand. Out of office, both the hard left and hard right have been able to rail against his policies and make outlandish promises of their own. Once in office, they will run into constraints and may find themselves unable to deliver on their promises \u2013 or simply risk being proved incompetent. Relinquishing some power now may give Macron\u2019s platform a better chance of retaining it in 2027. How does the election work? France\u2019s National Assembly has 577 seats, one for each of its electoral districts. For an absolute majority a party needs 289. In the outgoing government, Macron\u2019s alliance had only 250 seats, and so needed support from other parties to pass laws. If a candidate wins a majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. But most elections go to a second round the following Sunday. Only those who won more than 12.5% of the votes of registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round, meaning it is often fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. At this stage, some candidates may drop out to give allies a better chance of victory. What are the roles of the parliament and president? The National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws \u2013 from pensions and taxation to immigration and education \u2013 while the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party, things run well. When they don\u2019t, the government can grind to a halt. With Macron\u2019s party trailing in the polls and three years left on his presidential term, he may have to appoint a prime minister from an opposition party \u2013 in an arrangement known as \u201ccohabitation.\u201d Nonetheless, Macron has pledged to see out the remainder of his presidential term. Other government ministers are appointed by the president on the prime minister\u2019s advice. While Macron would in theory be free to nominate whomever he pleases, in practice he would be compelled to nominate ministers that reflect the will of the majority of the National Assembly. Who are the key players? In January, Gabriel Attal \u2013 Macron\u2019s protege \u2013 became the youngest prime minister in French history, at the age of 34. Just seven months later, his record could be broken by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader of the RN. Bardella was handpicked by Le Pen to head the party in 2022, ending a 50-year-rule by the Le Pen family and continuing to detoxify the party from its antisemitic and jackbooted past. Bardella grew up as an only child in social housing in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb in Paris. He joined the RN when he was 16 and briefly attended the prestigious Sorbonne university, before dropping out to climb the party ranks. If appointed, he will become Europe\u2019s youngest prime minister in more than two centuries. Bardella\u2019s campaign was bolstered after Eric Ciotti, leader of the mainstream conservative party, the Republicans, said they would enter coalition with the RN. His announcement drew fury from his blindsided party, which has attempted to oust him \u2013 so far unsuccessfully. Ciotti\u2019s endorsement may represent the death knell of France\u2019s \u201ccordon sanitaire\u201d \u2013 the principle by which mainstream parties refuse to cooperate with the radical extremes. On the left, four days after Macron called the election, a cluster of parties banded together to form the New Popular Front \u2013 a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked fascists from gaining power in 1936. The capacious \u2013 and potentially fractious \u2013 alliance comprises three-time presidential candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the France Unbowed party; the Socialists; the Communists; the Ecologists; and Place Publique, headed by the popular member of the European Parliament (MEP) Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann. It is not clear who the bloc would nominate as prime minister, nor how lasting the coalition might prove to be. But it could deliver a blow to Macron\u2019s Renaissance. Rather than several left-wing candidates appearing on the ballot, fragmenting the left-wing vote, there will now only be one in most constituencies, making it easier for the candidate to progress to the second round. What problems might an incoming government face? Since Macron called the election, the financial markets have taken fright \u2013 first at the prospect of an extremist government, then at the economic policies of the left and right. Earlier this month, the risk premium investors demand to hold French government debt reached its highest since 2022. France is running one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone and now risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules, which had been suspended to help countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. French government spending could soon be brutally constrained by Brussels, despite the lavish promises of the RN and New Popular Front. \u201cThe debate on the left and the right is not about fiscal consolidation, it\u2019s about the degree of fiscal expansion they want to implement,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at political risk consultancy the Eurasia Group, told CNN. \u201cNo one is talking about austerity.\u201d Although Bardella has recently tempered some of the RN\u2019s spending plans, Rahman warned there could be a \u201cmajor confrontation\u201d between Brussels and an incoming French government. While these spending constraints might prevent an incoming far-right government from making good on its electoral promises, this may harm rather than help Macron. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that if there\u2019s chaos, it necessarily arrests the momentum of the far right. It may also hurt Macron. The electorate may conclude that ultimately the far right wasn\u2019t able to implement their program because Macron was a constraint \u2013 and that the way to get over the chaos is to ultimately give the far right a majority in 2027,\u201d said Rahman. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s going to end up with blood on their hands \u2013 not just the far right, but probably Macron as well.\u201d What might the outcome be? The two-round voting system makes predictions difficult. If the RN reaches the second round in lots of constituencies, people may vote tactically to keep the party out. But their lead in the polls suggests they are on track to improve significantly on the 88 seats they had in the outgoing parliament \u2013 even if they fall short of an absolute majority. The most likely scenario is a hung parliament, with a relative majority for the RN. But Bardella has said his party will only form a government if it wins an absolute majority. Macron might then have to search for a prime minister on the hard left, or somewhere else entirely. France might have to opt for a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d government \u2013 but these tend to fan the flames of populism rather than extinguish them. Whatever the composition of the next Assembly, France\u2019s next three years are likely to be marked by instability, as parties try to keep their hands clean ahead of the key presidential - and potentially parliamentary - elections in 2027. \u201cOne possibility is that in anticipation of those elections, all the parties in the parliament will see reasons to block each other,\u201d said Arceneaux. \u201cIf we arrive in that situation, we\u2019re just going to have a paralyzed government that\u2019s unable to do anything.\u201d This will likely raise constitutional questions, as domestic and foreign policy questions clash. Bardella has ruled out sending troops to Ukraine \u2013 an idea floated by Macron \u2013 and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. In that situation, whose will would prevail \u2013 Bardella\u2019s or Macron\u2019s? \u201cThis is a perfect example of what we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Arceneaux. \u201cMacron could say, \u2018As President of France, foreign affairs are my responsibility\u2026 so I\u2019m not going to enforce that.\u2019 But then you have a problem, right? You have a constitutional crisis.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/europe/france-parliament-election-explainer-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_europe_deepfake-video-zelensky-wife-intl-latam", "text": "A deepfake video that wrongly suggested the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a luxury car during the couple\u2019s visit to Paris last month is likely part of a Russian-linked disinformation network, according to CNN\u2019s analysis and disinformation experts. The AI-generated\u00a0video\u00a0features a non-existent employee of the Bugatti dealership in Paris claiming Olena Zelenska purchased its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, for 4.5 million euros (around $4.8 million) on June 7. The clip has several markings of a deep fake, from cuts in the video, to the strange accent and lip-and-mouth movements, according to Cl\u00e9ment Briens, a researcher at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. Yet, it gathered some 18 million views in 24 hours on X, where it was reposted by pro-Russian influencers. Bugatti said in a statement on Tuesday that its dealership in Paris, operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company, was victim of several criminal offenses and \u201cfirmly denounced this disinformation campaign.\u201d \u201cA supposed salesman claiming to belong to the Car Lovers Group and its sports label Schumacher Group, published a video on social networks in which he indicated that the Bugatti Paris dealership sold a vehicle to the Ukrainian presidential couple,\u201d it said, adding that the group \u201cstrongly denies both the existence of the transaction and, consequently, the existence of the invoice.\u201d \u201cThe mandatory legal details don\u2019t appear on the invoice, the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their descriptions are inaccurate and inconsistent, the graphics are outdated, and the Car Lovers Group would never have allowed such a document to be issued,\u201d the statement added. The group also said it has taken legal action \u201cby filing a criminal complaint for forgery, use of forgeries, usurpation of identity and defamation\u201d \u2013 but did not specify against whom the complaint was filed. Clarity, an AI cybersecurity startup that is fighting against deepfakes, told CNN that their review of the video indicated \u201ca high certainty for AI manipulations, mostly around the middle of the face area.\u201d The video originates from a French-language website, Verite Cachee France (sic), whose content appears to be AI-generated by scraping French media. A CNN analysis shows Verite Cachee was set up recently, on June 22, 2024, and some of its pages still have prompts with AI to create fake articles at the top of the piece. CNN is not able to find a contact for the website. The website\u2019s title also doesn\u2019t use accents \u2013 the proper spelling would be V\u00e9rit\u00e9 Cach\u00e9e \u2013 casting further doubts on its authenticity. Darren Linvill, a professor at Clemson University\u2019s Media Forensics Hub, told CNN the deep fake and Verite Cachee\u2019s websites bear the hallmarks of a Russian narrative laundering campaign that has been going on since last August, with the aim of undermining Ukraine. \u201cThey typically place some video with a story to tell on YouTube. They then tell that story by layering it on the fake news pages they\u2019ve created, and often also one or more allied web pages. They then integrate the story through social media, starting with real pro-Russian influencers who are part of their network,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cOnly minor change with this campaign is that the video doesn\u2019t seem to be on YouTube.\u201d In a\u00a0report\u00a0from last December, Linvill and Patrick Warren, also a professor at Clemson, showed how the disinformation campaign was led by DC Weekly, a website that published a series of AI-generated Russian propaganda and fake stories, such as the debunked claim that Olena Zelenska bought $1.1 million jewellery at Cartier in New York last September. A report by Recorded Future, a leading cybersecurity company, also identified Veritee Cachee as being part of the same disinformation network. Given the size and resources of the network, it is likely some Russian support or financing is happening, Cl\u00e9ment Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst at the company, told CNN. \u201cThey scrape articles automatically from a number of sources, using LLMs to introduce specifically political bias to attack Zelensky, Biden and NATO. Then they upload the articles to launder a pro-Russian narrative,\u201d Briens said. The sheer volume of articles makes it harder to detect when deep fakes are introduced because when someone clicks on the website, they see a backlog of articles that usually pass the initial check, he said. \u201cThen after someone uploads the video from YouTube or directly into the site, the amplification system gets activated on social media.\u201d The target is political readers in Europe, with the purpose to erode domestic political support for Ukraine and undermine European leaders that support Ukraine, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, according to the analyst.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/europe/deepfake-video-zelensky-wife-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_01_weather_hurricane-beryl-caribbean-landfall-monday", "text": "Hurricane Beryl has strengthened into a Category 5 Atlantic hurricane \u2014 the earliest on record \u2014 as it powers across the Caribbean after bringing devastation to the Windward Islands, where at least one person is dead. Its intensity also\u00a0marks just the second time an Atlantic hurricane has reached Category 5\u00a0status\u00a0in July after Emily did so on\u00a0July 17, 2005, according to the National Hurricane Center. Beryl\u2019s maximum sustained winds have increased to near 160 mph, with higher gusts, the NHC said. \u201cFluctuations in strength are likely during the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to still be near major hurricane intensity as its moves into the central Caribbean and passes near Jamaica on Wednesday,\u201d the NHC said. Beryl made landfall shortly after 11:00 a.m. EDT on Grenada\u2019s Carriacou Island in the Caribbean Sea with max winds of 150 mph. It is the strongest\u00a0known hurricane to pass through the Grenadines, according to data from NOAA that goes back to 1851. There were \u201cwidespread reports of destruction and devastation in Carriacou and Petite Martinique,\u201d Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said in a Monday news briefing. \u201cIn half an hour, Carriacou was flattened.\u201d Mitchell said there were no immediate reports of death or injury in Grenada but warned that could change. \u201cYou have to appreciate the ferocity and the strength of the\u00a0hurricane\u00a0and therefore we are not yet out of the woods,\u201d he said. At least one death was reported in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where hundreds of homes and buildings have been damaged, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves announced Monday evening, noting there may be more fatalities. Parts of St. Vincent\u00a0and the Grenadines were left with no water or electricity as of Monday night, Gonsalves said. Hurricane Beryl \u201cleft in its wake immense destruction, pain, suffering, across our nation at this hour,\u201d he said. Union Island, just north of Grenada, was devastated, with reports indicating 90% of the houses have been severely damaged or destroyed, Gonsalves said. In Grenada, about 95% of the island has lost power due to Hurricane\u00a0Beryl, Neila K. Ettienne, press secretary for the office of the prime minister, told CNN on Monday. Telecommunications across Grenada\u00a0are down, and some individuals have lost internet service, Ettienne explained. All schools and business are closed, including the airport, the secretary said, adding only hospitals and the national police force are currently operational. The airport reported a sustained wind speed of 92 mph and a gust of 121 mph Monday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. Beryl\u2019s arrival\u00a0marks an exceptionally early start to the Atlantic hurricane season. On Sunday it became the earliest Category 4 on record in the Atlantic Ocean and the only Category 4 in the month of June. The abnormally warm ocean waters that facilitated Beryl\u2019s alarming strengthening are a clear indicator that this hurricane season will be far from normal in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Beryl is breaking records because the ocean is as warm now as it would normally be at the peak of hurricane season, said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and science advisor at nonprofit First Street Foundation. \u201cHurricanes don\u2019t know what month it is, they only know what their ambient environment is,\u201d Kossin told CNN. \u201cBeryl is breaking records for the month of June because Beryl thinks it\u2019s September.\u201d Kossin added the ocean heat fueling Beryl\u2019s unprecedented strengthening \u201ccertainly have a human fingerprint on them.\u201d The latest on Beryl: \u2022 Beryl is a dangerous hurricane:\u00a0The storm was located 510 miles east-southeast of Isla Beata in the Dominican Republic, had sustained winds of 160 mph and was moving to the west-northwest at 22 mph as of Monday evening. Beryl\u2019s hurricane-force winds extend 40 miles from center while tropical-storm-force winds extend about 125 miles. The storm\u2019s center is expected to move away from the southern Windward Islands Monday night and across the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea through Tuesday, and is forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday. \u2022 Hurricane warning for Jamaica: Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast on Jamaica by Wednesday, according to the NHC. Tropical storm warnings are also in effect for the south coast of Dominican Republic from Punta Palenque westward to the border with Haiti, and the south coast of Haiti from the border with the Dominican Republic to Anse-d\u2019Hainault. \u2022 Hundreds evacuated: More than 400 people were being housed in hurricane shelters across Barbados on Sunday night, the nation\u2019s Chief Shelter Warden, Ramona Archer-Bradshaw, told CNN affiliate CBC News. \u2022 State of emergency in Grenada: A state of emergency declared Sunday night by Grenadian Gov. General C\u00e9cile La Grenade will remain in effect until Tuesday morning. All businesses have closed except the police force, hospitals, prisons, waste disposal and ports. \u2022 Airports remain closed: Airports in Barbados, Grenada and Saint Lucia were closed Sunday night as Beryl approached. Grenada\u2019s Maurice Bishop International Airport is expected to reopen Tuesday morning, a spokesperson said. The Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados and St. Lucia\u2019s Hewanorra International and George Charles airports have also halted operations. The Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados will resume operations Tuesday, a spokesperson said. \u2022 Cricket World Cup fans stuck:\u00a0Barbados is still hosting cricket fans from around the globe who traveled to the island for the T20 World Cup, some of whom are not scheduled to leave until Monday or Tuesday, said Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley. \u201cSome of them have never gone through a hurricane or a storm before,\u201d she added, imploring residents to provide support for visitors, if possible. Where Beryl is headed next Landfall is far from the end of Beryl\u2019s story, and its long-term path is still uncertain. The hurricane will track generally west or northwest over the Caribbean Sea through Thursday, and is expected to remain a major hurricane \u2013 Category 3 or stronger \u2013 into midweek before losing a bit of strength. Even so, the hurricane will remain formidable with strong winds, torrential rain and hazardous seas extending well beyond its center over much of the Caribbean. Beryl\u2019s center could pass just south of Jamaica on Wednesday and bring heavier impacts to the country even if it doesn\u2019t make landfall there. \u201cStorm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate coast of Jamaica,\u201d the hurricane center said. Several days are likely to elapse between Beryl\u2019s first landfall in the Windward Islands Monday and its next likely landfall on or around Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula around Friday morning. The hurricane center also noted large swells from the storm will continue in the Windward and southern Leeward Islands for the next couple of days. \u201cSwells are also expected to reach the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola late tonight into Tuesday. These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\u201d it said. What happens after Beryl\u2019s next landfall will also determine if the cyclone is able to reach the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend. If Beryl is able to survive its journey over land and reach the bathtub-warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, it could spell trouble for northeast Mexico or possibly the US Gulf Coast. An unprecedented start to hurricane season This season is already off to a busy start as a second storm \u2013 Tropical Storm Chris \u2013 made landfall near Tuxpan, Mexico, off the Gulf Coast early Monday. Beryl is ushering in a troubling start to a hurricane season that forecasters have warned will be hyperactive \u2013 and Beryl\u2019s record-shattering activity may be a sign of what\u2019s to come. Beryl is the earliest\u00a0major hurricane \u2013 defined as one that is Category 3 or higher \u2013 in the Atlantic in 58 years. The storm\u2019s rapid intensification is very atypical this early into hurricane season, according to National Hurricane Center Director Mike Brennan. It\u2019s rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, as only a handful of tropical systems have done so,\u00a0according to NOAA records. The storm isn\u2019t just early for this season. It is now the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s third-earliest major hurricane. The earliest was Hurricane Alma on June 8, 1966, followed by Hurricane Audrey, which reached major hurricane status on June 27, 1957. Beryl has also set the record for the easternmost hurricane to form in the Tropical Atlantic in June, beating a previous record set in 1933. The central and eastern Atlantic traditionally become more active in August, in part because ocean temperatures have had time to warm and fuel developing systems. This year, however, the Atlantic basin has seen above normal water temperatures and a lack of wind shear due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o season to La Ni\u00f1a season, both of which are fuel for tropical development. \u201cBeryl\u00a0has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\u201d Brennan said. Systems forming this early in the summer in this part of the Atlantic\u00a0is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to\u00a0research from\u00a0Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University.\u00a0Normally, ocean temperatures aren\u2019t warm enough in June and July to help tropical systems thrive. National Weather Service\u00a0forecasters\u00a0predict\u00a017 to 25 named storms this season, with as many as 13 of those becoming hurricanes. \u201cThat\u2019s well above average,\u201d Brennan noted.

Former Israeli National Security Advisor Eyal Hulata, who according to the Times maintains regular communication with \u201csenior miliary officials,\u201d spoke on the record, saying, \u201cThe military is in full support of a hostage deal and a ceasefire \u2026 They believe that they can always go back and engage Hamas militarily in the future.\u201d Faced with a \u201cforever war\u201d scenario, four of the officials interviewed by the Times agreed with Hulata that \u201ckeeping Hamas in power for now in exchange for getting the hostages back seems like the least worst option for Israel.\u201d But in a statement, Netanyahu said, \u201cI do not know who these anonymous sources are, but I am here to make it unequivocally clear: This will not happen. The war will end once Israel achieves all of its objectives, including the destruction of Hamas and the release of all of our hostages.\u201d \u201cThe government directed the IDF to achieve these war objectives and the IDF has all the means to achieve them. We will not capitulate to the winds of defeatism, neither in The New York Times nor anywhere else. We are inspired by the spirit of victory.\u201d The report was published as the situation in Israel\u2019s north remains extremely tense, with the Israeli military and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah ramping up cross-border attacks, which risk boiling\u00a0over into a full-scale war. \u201cThey (the IDF) understand that a pause in Gaza makes de-escalation more likely in Lebanon,\u201d Hulata told the Times. \u201cAnd they have less munitions, less spare parts, less energy than they did before \u2014 so they also think a pause in Gaza gives us more time to prepare in case a bigger war does break out with Hezbollah,\u201d he is quoted as saying. When asked by the Times if it supported a truce, the IDF released a statement that didn\u2019t answer the question directly. \u201cThe IDF is determined to continue fighting to achieve the goals of the war to destroy the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas, the return of the hostages and the safe return of the residents in the north and south to their homes.\u201d \u201cSo far, significant achievements have been made in fighting in Gaza, the IDF will continue to fight Hamas everywhere in the Gaza Strip, along with continuing to promote war readiness in the north and a defense effort at all borders,\u201d it added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/middleeast/netanyahu-rejects-hamas-ceasefire-hezbollah-war-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_middleeast_al-shifa-hospital-director-released-israel-detention-intl-hnk", "text": "The head of Gaza\u2019s largest hospital has claimed he was repeatedly tortured\u00a0during his seven months in Israeli detention, following his sudden release Monday, in a move that highlighted growing rifts in the Israeli establishment. Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of the Al-Shifa medical complex, who was arrested in late November during the first of two Israeli raids on the facility in Gaza City, was released along with 50 other Palestinian detainees. Their release has sparked outcry in Israel and was criticized across the political spectrum, as well as by families of the Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas during its deadly October 7 attack. At a news conference Monday, Abu Salmiya alleged Palestinian detainees suffered \u201csevere torture\u201d and had medical treatment denied. \u201cMy little finger was broken. I was repeatedly subjected to hitting on the head, causing bleeding multiple times. There was almost daily torture in the Israeli prisons,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe doctor there beats the detainees, and the nurse beats the detainees. This is in violation of all international laws.\u201d Abu Salmiya said fellow prisoners lost a significant\u00a0amount of weight and were \u201ccompletely denied treatment.\u201d \u201cThey amputated the feet of several prisoners, those who are suffering from diabetes symptoms due to the lack of medical treatment for them,\u201d he said. In response to allegations of abuse, the Israeli Prison Service told CNN Monday it was \u201cnot aware of the claims,\u201d that \u201call prisoners are detained according to the law\u201d and \u201call basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards.\u201d A prison service spokesperson said, \u201cprisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities.\u201d Abu Salmiya was reportedly detained while evacuating the hospital with a World Health Organization convoy. The Israeli military said at the time the director was \u201capprehended and transferred for \u2026 questioning following evidence showing that the Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control center.\u201d Al-Shifa became a flashpoint in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza and now lies in ruins following a 14-day Israeli siege in March. Israel repeatedly claimed that a Hamas command center sat underneath the medical complex and that the militant group has used it\u00a0to hold hostages. Hamas has denied the claims, as have health officials working there. CNN cannot independently verify the accusations and Israel has not released definitive proof to back the claim. Other Palestinian detainees released on Monday described overcrowded detention centers where prisoners were abused, diseases were rife, and food was scarce. \u201cMorning and night we were being beaten, besides the solitary confinement and besides the diseases that spread between the prisoners,\u201d released detainee Faraj Attiyeh Al-Saman told CNN. \u201cThey would show us photos of our relatives\u2019 bodies, pictures of our families and children \u2026 and say: \u2018Look at your children, we killed them.\u2019 They would show us pictures of our wives, our sisters, and tell us that they had taken them and done this and that to them,\u201d Faraj said. It is unclear how the released detainees were arrested and under what premise. Those CNN spoke to were detained after being questioned at Gaza checkpoints. Israeli security officials have previously told CNN that they have been made aware of allegations of torture tactics being used against Palestinians within Israel\u2019s prison system and have said they are investigating. Israeli outcry The release has created tensions within Israel as its war with Hamas stretches into its ninth month, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordering an \u201cimmediate inquiry into the matter,\u201d according to his office. Netanyahu said the decision followed discussions at the High Court, and the identity of the released prisoners was determined independently by security officials \u201cbased on their professional considerations.\u201d Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet said in a statement that detainees who posed a \u201clesser danger\u201d were released to \u201cfree up places of confinement.\u201d Shin Bet said it had been warning for about a year of the need to increase the number of spaces in detention centers \u201cgiven the need to arrest terrorists\u201d in the West Bank and Gaza. \u201cWithout a choice, without an immediate solution to the prison shortage, arrests will continue to be canceled and detainees will continue to be released,\u201d the agency said. But far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was among those outraged by the decision, calling the release of Abu Salmiya and other prisoners \u201csecurity negligence.\u201d Former defense minister Benny Gantz, who resigned from Israel\u2019s\u00a0War Cabinet last month, said \u201cwhoever made this decision lacked judgment and should be fired today.\u201d The decision to release the detainees comes as families of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas during the October 7 attacks continue to wait for news of their loved ones. As many as 120 hostages remain captive in Gaza. In a statement Monday, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum headquarters said it hoped the Israeli government would be \u201cdetermined to release our family members, with the same determination as it releases the director of Shifa Hospital.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/middleeast/al-shifa-hospital-director-released-israel-detention-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_europe_france-far-right-brink-of-power-what-next-intl", "text": "The man who once described his leadership style as Jupiterian now resembles Icarus, after he played with political fire and got burnt. French President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u2019s centrist alliance was crushed on Sunday\u00a0after the far-right National Rally (RN) party\u00a0surged in the first round of the country\u2019s parliamentary elections. Once seen as a fringe movement the\u00a0RN\u00a0could\u00a0now\u00a0be positioned to assume power, after winning 33% of the vote. It would then\u00a0become the first far-right party to enter the French government since\u00a0World War\u00a0II\u00a0\u2013 although nothing is certain\u00a0ahead of Sunday\u2019s\u00a0second round. The left-wing alliance, New Popular Front, also did well,\u00a0coming\u00a0second with 28% of the vote. Meanwhile,\u00a0Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance trailed\u00a0in third place with 21% of the vote, leaving many in his camp to ponder why the president called the snap election in the first place. \u201cTonight is not a night like any other,\u201d\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0Gabriel Attal said solemnly in an address to the French. \u201cThe far-right are at the gates of power.\u201d There\u2019s a long way to go in this election yet, however,\u00a0so\u00a0what happens next? Three rival blocs Only 76 candidates were elected to the 577-seat parliament on Sunday:\u00a039\u00a0from the RN and its allies, 32 from the New Popular Front, and just two lawmakers from Macron\u2019s alliance. The rest of the seats\u00a0will be\u00a0decided in the second round next weekend, and huge amounts of\u00a0political bargaining and maneuvering\u00a0are\u00a0expected before\u00a0then.\u00a0This could\u00a0determine whether a\u00a0truly\u00a0seismic shift is underway in French politics,\u00a0and\u00a0the landscape\u00a0is\u00a0now divided between three rival blocs. It\u2019s created an unprecedented situation, with a record number of three-way races poised to take place\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0\u2013\u00a0306 compared with only\u00a0eight\u00a0in 2022. Only\u00a0those\u00a0candidates who make it past the 12.5% threshold make it to the runoff. Typically, most constituencies only see two candidates go through, but this year, around half will see three candidates proceed to the next round\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a first in France\u2019s modern history. Those three-way races benefit candidates who came out on top in the first round and with the RN in a lead position in over half of the runoffs, some parties are strategizing to block the far-right. They don\u2019t have much time, as candidates need\u00a0to decide\u00a0whether\u00a0they will\u00a0run or not before Tuesday night. The\u00a0left-wing New Popular Front has announced that it will withdraw all candidates who came in third to help prevent far-right candidates from getting elected. Macron\u2019s alliance has not been as clear with only his prime minister insisting that \u201cnot one vote should go to the far-right.\u201d Ultimately, it all remains just guidance \u2013 withdrawing or not is up to the individual candidates, and voters will make their own choices. A grenade to global order This parliamentary election has captivated people domestically \u2013 the exceptional turnout\u00a0of 67%\u00a0speaks for itself, but the rest of the world should pay close attention too. Far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen\u2019s RN party\u00a0is notoriously euroskeptic, and though it no longer talks of a full-blown \u201cFrexit,\u201d\u00a0or French departure from the European Union,\u00a0its manifesto puts into question the very foundations of the European project. The\u00a0RN\u00a0has made it clear it would seek to weaken the union, and regain\u00a0more\u00a0control of its borders and sovereignty. Once in power, and with Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban as far-right allies, their plans for Europe could carry a lot more weight. If the\u00a0RN\u00a0does dominate parliament, it will also be good news for\u00a0Russian President Vladmir\u00a0Putin.\u00a0Le Pen has also only briefly criticized Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, having also previously taken a huge loan from a Russian bank and boasted\u00a0of\u00a0her \u201cadmiration for Vladimir Putin.\u201d Ahead of the election, Le Pen questioned the role of the president in military affairs.\u00a0Macron has pledged to see out the remainder of his final presidential term, which runs until 2027.\u00a0Constitutionally, the president heads the army, and Macron has not eliminated the possibility of sending French troops to Ukraine. Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader of RN, has categorically said that as prime minister, he would not let any French soldier set foot in Ukraine, throwing the French constitutional order into question. In 2022, Le Pen also\u00a0said she\u00a0wanted to leave the military wing of NATO \u2013 but her party has since backtracked,\u00a0saying that wouldn\u2019t happen as long as the war in Ukraine is ongoing. Macron\u2019s party is already governing in\u00a0the country\u2019s lower house, the National Assembly,\u00a0without a majority after its poorer-than-expected showing in the 2022 legislative elections, forcing it either to seek out coalitions to pass legislation, or use a constitutional tool to force through new laws. But falling behind to either the left or right could be the death knell to his agenda. A loss would force Macron to nominate a prime minister from whichever party wins \u2013 putting a political opponent in charge of running the government. Bardella has said that he would only govern if his party wins an absolute majority \u2013 and with the first round suggesting none of the parties will win those 289 necessary seats, there is no obvious prime minister in sight. It could be a political deadlock in France for at least the next year \u2013\u00a0and a\u00a0crisis for President Macron, arguably of his own making.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/europe/france-far-right-brink-of-power-what-next-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_tech_microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust", "text": "Microsoft has violated European Union antitrust laws by bundling Teams with its other popular applications for businesses, EU officials said Tuesday, marking the bloc\u2019s latest challenge to a US tech giant. If confirmed, the preliminary findings of an EU investigation could lead to a fine of up to 10% of Microsoft\u2019s global revenue, which totaled $211 billion in its latest financial year. The announcement comes a day after EU regulators accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act, a groundbreaking law that forced big changes on dominant tech platforms after it came into force in March. Apple, which has denied wrongdoing, also faces a huge fine if the charges are confirmed. The actions by the EU could result in changes to the way hundreds of millions of Europeans access services on some of the world\u2019s biggest digital platforms, reflecting a big push by European lawmakers to rein in the power of Big Tech. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, opened an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s software practices almost a year ago following a complaint in 2020 by the cloud-based internal messaging app Slack, which is now owned by Salesforce (CRM). Slack alleged that Microsoft (MSFT) had given Teams, which offers messaging, calling and video meetings, an unfair advantage by automatically including it with its Office software and thereby denying Slack an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. The European Commission shares Slack\u2019s worries. \u201cWe are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in statement. \u201cPreserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft\u2019s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules,\u201d she added. According to the Commission, Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically including the tool in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites. The company\u2019s advantage over rivals \u201cmay have been further exacerbated by interoperability limitations between Teams\u2019 competitors and Microsoft\u2019s offerings. The conduct may have prevented Teams\u2019 rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers,\u201d the Commission said. Microsoft announced last year that it would stop the Teams bundling practice in Europe and extended the same commitment globally in April. But, while the Commission acknowledged that the company had started offering \u201csome suites without Teams,\u201d it said it believes \u201cmore changes to Microsoft\u2019s conduct are necessary to restore competition.\u201d In a statement, Microsoft President Brad Smith said: \u201cHaving unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2019s remaining concerns.\u201d Salesforce, meanwhile, welcomed the Commission\u2019s findings, calling its actions \u201ca win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft practices with Teams have harmed competition.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_26_tech_uae-ai-minister-omar-al-olama-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "The world\u2019s first minister dedicated to developing artificial intelligence (AI) strategy is already becoming embroiled in a global power struggle for tech supremacy. In April, Microsoft (MSFT) announced a $1.5 billion investment in G42, an AI group based in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and chaired by an influential member of the ruling royal family. The deal, which analysts say was motivated by the Biden administration\u2019s desire to limit Beijing\u2019s influence in the region as the US battles to maintain its lead over China in the AI race, firmly pulled the firm into the orbit of the United States. \u201cI think the UAE and the US really see eye to eye with regards to how these technologies are pushed forward,\u201d UAE AI Minister Omar Al Olama, who was appointed in 2017, told CNN in a recent video interview. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see more alignment there.\u201d G42, a holding firm, is comprised of seven companies that work across data centers, energy, healthcare, surveillance and biotechnology. Its controlling shareholder is Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who also serves as the UAE national security adviser. The UAE is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of fossil fuels, and Abu Dhabi sees its AI push as crucial for diversifying away from oil. AI could contribute $96 billion to the UAE economy by 2030, equivalent to nearly 14% of its gross domestic product, according to a report by PwC Middle East. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are at the frontier of the technology, and that\u2019s why we work with partners around the frontier,\u201d said Olama, \u201cand play by the rules that are set by the market leaders.\u201d Olama, whose ministerial remit includes digital economy and remote work applications, wants to make the UAE a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2031. The UAE has laid out a national strategy to get there. Its objectives include deploying AI in priority sectors such as energy and logistics, developing an ecosystem and attracting talent. The country is putting public officials through AI training, and Dubai is aiming to teach a million citizens effective prompt engineering, instructing AI models to produce high-quality output. As of September, the Gulf country had 120,000 people working on AI or related industries, up from 30,000 two years earlier, Al Olama has said. Choosing sides Sometimes, the country has had to prioritize its relationship with the US over Washington\u2019s rivals. A US Congressional committee called on the Commerce Department in January to investigate G42\u2019s links to Chinese military companies and intelligence services (G42 denied any such connections), and the Microsoft investment required G42 to cut ties with Chinese hardware suppliers, reportedly including Huawei, in favor of US companies. \u201cThe US does not shy away from saying that \u2018on this technology specifically you need to choose sides,\u2019\u201d said Olama. The UAE has historically performed a balancing act with its foreign policy. It cooperates with the US on a range of issues, including defense, and in recent years the US has sold tens of billions of dollars of military equipment to the Gulf nation. The Biden administration, which sees maintaining a lead in AI as crucial for its future economic success and national security, has implemented a series of measures including export controls on AI and semiconductor technologies to slow China\u2019s advancement in the industry. Washington has also limited the sale of sophisticated US chips to ensure China doesn\u2019t use Middle Eastern nations as a back door to access the newest AI technology, according to Reuters. Nvidia, the world\u2019s third biggest company after Microsoft and Apple, said in an August 2023 regulatory filing that the US government had informed the chipmaker that some of its products would face additional licensing requirements for \u201ccertain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\u201d Some US politicians have raised concerns that they don\u2019t have enough details about the deal between G42 and Microsoft and that US technology might be vulnerable to Chinese espionage in the UAE. The country has ties to Beijing, too, and China is a key trade partner. Olama insists the UAE is a trustworthy partner. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that there is any risk, especially since there\u2019s a lot of cutting-edge American technology that is in the UAE,\u201d said Olama, adding that he was speaking in his personal capacity, not as a government official. \u2018A leading tech power\u2019 In late 2023, Abu Dhabi\u2019s government-backed Technology Innovation Institute unveiled a large language model (LLM), the technology behind generative AI chatbots, called Falcon10B. It outperformed offerings from Google and Meta by some metrics. \u201cThe UAE put a stake in the ground in the AI race with Falcon,\u201d James Lewis, who studies technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington DC-based think tank, told CNN. In October 2023, a collaboration between Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, Silicon Valley-based Cerebras Systems and Inception, a subsidiary of G42, produced Jais, a generative AI model trained on Arabic as well as English. Its creators said it could pave the way for LLMs in other languages that are \u201cunderrepresented in mainstream AI.\u201d Unlike ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, Falcon and Jais are open-source, which means their code is available for anyone to use or change. By opening up the technology, Abu Dhabi is positioning itself as an ally to developing nations that don\u2019t have the resources to build their own AI tools. \u201cWe know that not every country can develop these systems or these tools,\u201d said Olama. \u201cSo, we want to ensure that we\u2019re able to develop it for them.\u201d Some analysts say the UAE\u2019s vast oil wealth will be key in developing hugely expensive AI infrastructure. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a financial story,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt gives them an edge in terms of being one of the leading tech powers in the future.\u201d As fears grow about the potential risks of AI, Olama has called for a global coalition to regulate the development and use of the technology. The stakes are high. In March, a report commissioned by the US State Department warned that the most advanced AI systems could, in a worst-case scenario, \u201cpose an extinction-level threat to the human species.\u201d Olama has some specific concerns. He expects deepfakes will cause a \u201cfundamental truth crisis\u201d and could drive a \u201cpolitical crisis.\u201d He\u2019s also worried that AI could make it easier to create biotech weapons. \u201cI try not to be a fear mongerer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are very few guardrails in place to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/tech/uae-ai-minister-omar-al-olama-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gunmen opened fire at multiple places of worship and a police traffic stop in two cities in the Muslim-majority republic on June 23, killing at least 15 police officers and at least four civilians, including an Orthodox priest, according to authorities. The niqab ban is to take place until \u201cthe identified threats are eliminated and a new theological conclusion is issued,\u201d deputy head of the Mufti of Dagestan Abdulla Salimov said in a video message Wednesday.

The latest people to be apprehended were the former commanding general of the air force, a sergeant accused of ramming a military vehicle into the government palace, another sergeant accused of driving a separate vehicle carrying military leaders, and an infantry captain accused of coordinating the movement of troops, according to Government Minister Eduardo del Castillo. The news brings the total number of arrests to 21. Wednesday\u2019s coup attempt prompted shock around the world, with images out of the capital La Paz showing military personnel occupying a square, armored vehicles ramming the palace door and soldiers trying to break into government offices. A report sent to CNN by the Bolivian government said military officials first held meetings in May to plot the coup attempt. The meetings were led by former army chief Gen.

{"id": "2024_07_01_sport_ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "Kateryna Tabashnyk couldn\u2019t hold back her tears \u2013 not necessarily because her attempt to qualify for her first Olympics had fallen short, but because she was now reflecting on all the grief and pain of the past two-and-a-half years. The 30-year-old high jumper cleared 1.89 meters at the Ukrainian Athletics Championships on Sunday, not enough to qualify for this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Paris. But the fact that she had even come so close was a testament to her remarkable willpower and perseverance. Tabashnyk\u2019s mother was killed in a Russian airstrike on Kharkiv two years ago. She had stayed in the eastern city to help her young nephew, who was seriously injured in an earlier attack by Russian forces. Tabashnyk decided to return to competition a month later, viewing sport as a means to honor her mother\u2019s life even in the depths of grief. \u201cOf course, it affects people and, of course, me \u2013 the loss of my home, the loss of my dear mother, the loss of friends,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAll this takes strength, takes energy. It\u2019s like a poison for the body.\u201d \u201cWe have to prepare to compete and show results against this background. Of course, it\u2019s very hard, it\u2019s very difficult, but to be honest, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been getting this energy, this strength for the last two years. It\u2019s something incredible, even for me.\u201d Ukraine will send a team of more than 100 athletes to Paris, and \u2013 though that\u2019s fewer than the country had in Tokyo three years ago \u2013 their participation will likely feel more significant. The Ukrainian athletes competing at the games have endured a myriad of challenges since Russia\u2019s invasion, including facilities being destroyed, friends and relatives being killed and uncertainty about what the future might hold. According to Ukraine\u2019s Sports Ministry, about 3,000 athletes \u2013 from Olympic and non-Olympic sports \u2013 have served for the country\u2019s military, either voluntarily or by being drafted, and 479 have been killed while serving or in civilian life. More than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed, including 15 Olympic training bases. Tabashnyk won bronze at the European Indoor Championships earlier this year \u2013 her first medal at a major event \u2013 and was hoping to be part of Ukraine\u2019s first Olympic team since Russia launched its full-scale invasion with the support of Belarus in February 2022. She had been confident of making the team before a recent injury hampered her preparation for the national championships in Lviv. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how many times I wanted to give it all up, give up on sports, on jumping,\u201d Tabashnyk said. \u201cBut every time I pull myself together and say, \u2018No, now I have to fight like never before.\u2019 And so it goes every time, no matter what obstacle stands in my way.\u201d She is far from the only Ukrainian athlete whose life has been scarred by Russia\u2019s invasion of their country. Many athletes have moved abroad in order to continue their careers and train for this year\u2019s Games. That includes 400-meter hurdler Viktoriia Tkachuk, who has become accustomed to undertaking the 46-hour trip from Ukraine to her training camp in South Africa. Tkachuk\u2019s brother was called up to the frontline in May last year, and since then, her whole family has been fraught with fear about his safety. \u201cWe were all stressed out because we were thinking, \u2018Oh, no, he\u2019s not ready yet, he cannot go there,\u2019\u201d the 29-year-old told CNN. \u201cBut we were doing our best to support him, because if he\u2019s worrying, then he will feel our worries and it will not help him.\u201d Tkachuk saw her brother in February when he had a break from military service, and the pair are in regular contact while they go about their separate lives. \u201cHe\u2019s texted me a message: \u2018You will win there, and I will win here,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSomething like this. \u2026 He has in his pocket \u2013 close to his heart \u2013 small pictures with us together, our family, and he said this picture is always with him. It\u2019s nice to know this.\u201d Having already qualified for the Olympics, a minor injury prevented Tkachuk from competing in Lviv, where CNN spoke to several athletes looking to secure a spot on the team. Despite Russia\u2019s invasion casting a long shadow over Ukraine\u2019s participation at these Olympics, there was a vibrant atmosphere at the event, and most athletes were excited by the chance to compete for an Olympic berth. \u201cNow, with a big team under our flag, we take part in a big Olympic movement, we take part in the biggest contest, and the entire world is looking at us,\u201d Matviy Bidnyi, Ukraine\u2019s acting sports minister, told CNN. \u201cAll of the world awaits what we will do in the Olympic Games, what we can show in the Olympic Games \u2013 that our country, which is in a condition of war now, is in a good shape.\u201d \u201cThis is a very important mission,\u201d he added, \u201cand all our athletes understand their responsibility in it.\u201d Whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to compete at this year\u2019s Olympics, which begin on July 26, has been the topic of intense debate, especially for Ukrainian athletes and officials. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said that Russian and Belarusians can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Paris, provided that they meet certain eligibility requirements. This means that teams of Russian and Belarusian athletes will not be considered, while athletes who actively support the war against Ukraine will also be ineligible. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation, such as flags, anthems or national colors. The IOC ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, but many people in Ukraine were hoping for a more stringent stance. \u201cWe think that this position is strong enough,\u201d said Bidnyi, \u201cbut we think it would be better if they were banned totally.\u201d There will be no Russians or Belarusians taking part in track and field events in Paris as governing body World Athletics has banned athletes from these two countries from competing at an elite level \u2013 the only Olympic sports federation to have done so. This means that athletes like Tkachuk will avoid the potentially challenging situation of lining up against competitors whose nations are at war with her country, irrespective of how they are presented at the Games. \u201cThis is really nice to know, for my brother also, that I\u2019m not going to competitions to run with Russians, or to speak with Russians, or to deal with something that I don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. Her teammate, fellow 400m hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends, we\u2019re not competitors,\u201d Ryzhykova told CNN about facing Russian and Belarusian athletes. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a right to be at the Olympics \u2026 because every one [of them] is guilty in some way.\u201d Like Tkachuk, Ryzhykova has had to spend time away from Ukraine while she trains and competes, basing herself in the Italian city of Brescia during the summer months. But being away from her family home in Dnipro isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cHome is my safe place where I can recharge, relax, where I feel good, where I can really rest between competitions or in my training life,\u201d says the 34-year-old, a 4x400m relay bronze medalist at the 2012 London Olympics. \u201cIn the training camps, it\u2019s totally different in other countries; it\u2019s good, some countries are really amazing, but it\u2019s not my native (country). I can\u2019t relax fully there.\u201d Ryzhykova has learned not to read the news on the days she has a competition, which means finding different ways to distract herself whenever thoughts of the war enter her mind. \u201cI use books, novels or something easier,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I have bad thoughts, I\u2019m going back to this novel, and [thinking], OK, what is my character doing? I need to concentrate on this. It\u2019s my plan for competition day.\u201d CNN\u2019s Svitlana Vlasova contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

Panama is home to the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, that has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. News of the agreement comes after Panama\u2019s new President Jose Raul Mulino vowed on Monday that the Central American nation would no longer be a country of transit for migrants. \u201cI will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony. \u201cPanama will no longer be a transit country for illegals,\u201d he said amid cheers from those present. \u201cThe numbers of illegal immigrants passing through the Dari\u00e9n are shocking,\u201d Mulino said, adding that he intends to \u201cappeal to international solidarity regarding the cause that generates the problem and will seek solutions with the countries involved, especially with the United States, which is the final destination of such immigrants.\u201d Mulino said that he\u2019s seen first-hand \u201cthe magnitude of the problem and the dimension of the humanitarian and environmental crisis\u201d that migration causes to the Dari\u00e9n Gap. \u201cThe Dari\u00e9n must continue to be a great green lung, not only for us but for the entire region.

The crash happened when the first stage of the Tianlong-3 rocket detached from its launch pad during a test, due to structural failure. It landed in a hilly area of the city of Gongyi in central China. \u201cDue to the structural failure of the connection between the rocket body and the test platform, the first-stage rocket was separated from the launch pad,\u201d Space Pioneer, also known as Beijing Tianbing Technology, said. \u201cAfter liftoff, the onboard computer was automatically shut down, and the rocket fell into the deep mountains 1.5 kilometers [0.9 miles] southwest of the test platform. The rocket body fell into the mountain and disintegrated.\u201d There were no injuries as a result of the crash, the company said, as people in the area were evacuated in advance of the rocket test. Space Pioneer, a leading company in the commercial rocket sphere, specializes in liquid-propellant rockets. In April 2023, it successfully launched its Tianlong-2 rocket, making the company China\u2019s first commercial launch operator to send a liquid carrier rocket into space and successfully enter orbit, according to state media.

The legislation, which came into effect Thursday, is part of a larger citizenship overhaul from Berlin as the government grapples with rising antisemitism, a surge in popularity for the far right, and fierce debate over its response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The country\u2019s naturalization exam will now include a number of new questions, according to a statement from the interior ministry. \u201cIn response to increasing antisemitism in Germany, the list of questions in the naturalization test has been expanded. New exam questions have been added on the topics of antisemitism, the right of the state of Israel to exist and Jewish life in Germany,\u201d it said. The war in Gaza, and Berlin\u2019s strong support for Israel, has fueled much discussion in Germany. In the aftermath of the October 7 attacks, German lawmakers, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, reiterated that Israel\u2019s security is Germany\u2019s \u201creason of state,\u201d or matter of national interest. But other voices in the country have accused authorities of going too far, infringing on the rights of pro-Palestinians to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Adding to the complex picture, Germany has the largest Palestinian diaspora in Europe, which is estimated at 300,000. German Green lawmaker Lamya Kaddor previously told CNN that Muslim communities in Germany have felt ostracized in light of events in the Middle East. \u2018A crystal clear red line\u2019 The legislation is being introduced nationwide after the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt also required citizenship applicants to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist in December. The implementation of the law on a federal level was advocated by the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party last year. The idea was also well-received by other parties in the Bundestag. Under the changes, the process for obtaining citizenship has also been sped up. Those who work in Germany and are considered \u201cwell integrated\u201d can now obtain citizenship after just five years instead of eight. Applicants no longer need to give up the citizenship of their previous country \u2013 something that used to be a requirement in Germany for first-generation migrants. Germany\u2019s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has welcomed Thursday\u2019s changes as a \u201ccommitment to a modern Germany.\u201d \u201cWhoever shares our values and makes an effort can now get a German passport more quickly and are not required to give up a part of their identity with the former citizenship,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have also made it just as clear: Whoever doesn\u2019t share our values, will not be able to get a German passport. Here we have drawn a crystal clear red line and made the law much stronger than before. Anti-Semitism, racism and other forms of contempt for humanity rule out naturalization. There is no tolerance for that.\u201d The reform comes as a new report from RIAS, an organization monitoring antisemitism in Germany, found that antisemitic incidents in the country rose around 83% last year, significantly increasing after the attack on Israel on October 7 and Israel\u2019s eight-month military offensive in Gaza.

Along with the lead horse, which was being led rather than ridden at the time, two riders were thrown from their horses as the animals ran free through the capital\u2019s streets. \u201cWe can confirm that whilst exercising this morning, three horses from the\u00a0Household\u00a0Cavalry\u00a0Mounted Regiment became loose from their riders.

He\u2019s made his name by courting the absurd and keeping audiences on their toes, embellishing his fables of love, power and free will with discordant musical motifs and disarming cuts to a wide lens. His latest project, \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d traces recognizable power dynamics \u2014 those with your boss, with your spouse or even with religious leaders \u2014 onto a surreal universe where they are intensified to their greatest (and often bloodiest) extremes. The film is told in three short stories. In the first, \u201cThe Death of R.M.F.,\u201d Jesse Plemons plays Robert, the hapless puppet of his boss Raymond (Willem Dafoe). In the second tale, \u201cR.M.F. is Flying,\u201d Plemons is a police officer whose wife (Emma Stone) has gone missing on a diving trip. When she returns, she seems fundamentally changed, prompting Plemons to test her love for him in progressively revolting ways. In the third instalment, \u201cR.M.F. Eats a Sandwich,\u201d Stone and a now-shaven headed Plemons are the disciples of a purity cult led by Dafoe, tasked with locating someone able to revive the dead. Although apparently detached from one another \u2014 bar the rotating cast and transient presence of the mysterious R.M.F. character (played by Yorgos Stefanakos) \u2014 each entry into the anthology repeats Lanthimos\u2019 career-spanning thesis: human agency is a myth, and people will commit unhinged acts to be accepted by the powerful. Happily, that dark existentialism didn\u2019t cloud the mood on set. \u201c(Lanthimos) puts together a group of really like-minded, lovely people that he feels will get along,\u201d Jennifer Johnson, the film\u2019s costume designer, told CNN via video call. \u201cWorking with Yorgos in general is a very satisfying, exhilarating and scary place, all at the same time. It\u2019s really fun!\u201d Power dressing \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is a film imbued with symbolism, and the costumes were critical in defining characters\u2019 relative status; in the first relationship we meet, Robert (Plemons) and Raymond (Dafoe) each wear their power quite literally on their sleeves. Raymond, dressed expensively in Italian suits, is \u201csomebody who has a lot of money, and exudes power and style but does it in his own way,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s this sense of confidence that was really important to telegraph very quickly, and this subtly eccentric way of dressing.\u201d His looks took inspiration from Gianni Agnelli, the head of Fiat between 1966 and 1996, who was a champion of Italy\u2019s nonchalantly chic \u201cSprezzatura\u201d style. \u201cHe would take hiking boots and wear them with a custom suit, with his watch worn on the outside of his shirt,\u201d Johnson recalled of Agnelli. \u201cIt\u2019s this mixing and matching that we take for granted now, but when (Agnelli) was dressing that was something that was very unusual.\u201d Per Raymond\u2019s written instructions \u2014 detailing not only how Robert should dress, but what he should read (always Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d); what he should eat, and when he should have sex with his wife \u2014 Plemons is also immaculately suited, if self-consciously so. \u201c(Raymond) gives him things that would make most men really uncomfortable,\u201d Johnson said, pointing to a pink Tom Ford turtleneck Robert\u2019s made to wear. \u201cIt\u2019s (one of) the little signifiers of eccentric power play.\u201d Three stories, three looks Having crafted a visual language to reflect one power dynamic, the film\u2019s structure meant the same also had to be done for the second and third chapters. \u201cEach story plays for about an hour, so there\u2019s definitely enough character development within each one that it is a full movie. That was very difficult in our short production time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWillem is such a great example: you are a CEO, and then you\u2019re (Stone\u2019s) father, and now you\u2019re a leader of a sex cult. To traverse that territory and walk all those distances in one (costume) fitting was a challenge, for sure.\u201d Most of the cast shoulder three characters each but, in the final chapter, Margaret Qualley had the additional task of playing identical twins Rebecca and Ruth. For Johnson, this required carving out clear character traits. \u201cWhat was nice is that one twin was really wild and had a punk rock spirit; you can imagine she\u2019s into indie music and is not really walking to a mainstream beat, whereas her twin sister is a veterinarian who is kind of bookish,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was important (the veterinarian) wore comfort shoes, so they were her Dansko clogs, and that she would have a darned sock; something that feels homemade. She likes pretty things, but she\u2019s not interested in fashion. You make these rules for each person.\u201d Dressing for laughs Despite the film\u2019s grim subject matter, there are unexpectedly comedic moments \u2014 not so much to offer respite but, if anything, to add to the jarring effect. Several of them rely on costuming to provide the visual gag \u2014 with Dafoe leading the charge. As Raymond, he stands up from the sofa after lambasting Robert to reveal a pair of exposed knees to the camera; a switch in tone sharp enough to pull roars of laughter from the audience in the movie theater. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of men in the world who can wear a knee-high sock and a white pleated short and look really gorgeous at the same time!\u201d Johnson joked. In the third chapter Dafoe plays a cult leader, freed from Raymond\u2019s designer suits and instead sporting little else besides eyeliner and orange Speedos. \u201cWillem is just one of the most lovely, delightful and intelligent collaborators you could ever ask for,\u201d Johnson beamed. \u201cHis physicality is so beautiful and lends itself to wearing clothing so well, so he can really go for it and wear the most absurd thing \u2014 but it\u2019s not wearing him; he\u2019s wearing it.\u201d The brightly-colored swimwear \u2014 a reflection of the cult\u2019s affinity for water \u2014 was a surprise pick for Dafoe, who made a beeline for it in the fitting room. \u201cBecause the cult is very sexual, I thought it would be great if we could get him in the least amount of clothes possible,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was the first thing that he saw and he said \u2018yup, I\u2019m putting that on!\u2019. It was a very fun moment because we didn\u2019t tell Yorgos about it. (Dafoe) walked out for the camera test in it, and it definitely got a laugh!\u201d On their hunt for the elusive \u201cwaker of the dead,\u201d Stone and Plemons\u2019 outfits \u2014 earth-tone, loosely-fitted suits paired with sandals \u2014 are also laughably conspicuous. Johnson drew reference to \u201cThe X Files,\u201d but Ken and Barbie trying to blend in on Venice Beach also springs to mind. \u201cThey\u2019re like detectives, and they\u2019re cult members but they have to pretend to be normal,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201cI think those characters thought \u2018oh, well a suit makes us look normal,\u2019 when in actuality they look really weird and more scary; they would have been better off in their cult wear, which was just outdoor gear.\u201d Plemons\u2019 suit was one of two found in a gargantuan thrift store \u2014 \u201clike a whole city unto itself\u201d \u2014 in New Orleans, where the film was shot. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun when you find that; you can just imagine the gentleman who donated it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt came in dark brown and tan, but the dark brown one never made it onto the camera.\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is an oddly-dressed, oddly-paced detour from a traditional blockbuster, but it does make a compelling argument for the collective, visceral experience of cinema. Over the course of an almost three-hour screening, Lanthimos\u2019 efforts provoked audible gasps, averted eyes and strangled groans. There was laughter: full-bodied at times, faltering at others, as viewers grappled with whether they were being entertained or horrified in real time. People recoiled. One person cried. As the credits rolled, a stunned silence fell over the room. The atmosphere had taken on its own heightened reality; complementary to Lanthimos\u2019 style, difficult to stop thinking about on the way home.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/style/kinds-of-kindness-costumes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

If successful, the lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Washington, DC, on Monday by Jewish advocacy group the Anti-Defamation League and the Crowell & Moring law firm, could unlock federal funds designated for victims of state-sponsored terrorism if the plaintiffs can prove their case. \u201cThis landmark litigation\u2026 is really about holding accountable the Islamic Republic as well as Syria and North Korea for the role that they played in providing finances and training and, of course, munitions to Hamas, enabling the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO and National Director of the ADL, told CNN. The lawsuit lays out publicly available evidence of Iran, Syria and North Korea\u2019s alleged history of support for Hamas: training, weapons and financial support from Iran; training and financing from Syria; and weapons and tunnel-digging know-how from North Korea. The lawsuit alleges that Hamas could not have carried out the October 7 attacks, which killed more than 1,200 people and led to the abduction of more than 250 others, without the support of these countries. Iran has been a longtime ally of Hamas, providing financial and military support to the group. The month after the attacks, a document\u00a0recovered from a computer\u00a0found inside a Hamas pickup truck outside Gaza, obtained by CNN from Israeli officials, showed Iran was seeking to provide technical training that would help Hamas produce its own weaponry. The 2015 Justice for United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act established the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, whose funds can be disbursed to victims and the families of deceased victims following the ruling of a US district court. Greenblatt acknowledged that it is unlikely that any of these three countries will respond to the allegations in federal court, but said he views the lawsuit as a critical step to not only seek accountability for their support for Hamas, but also to counter efforts by some anti-Israel activists to deny the horrific nature of the October 7 attack. The plaintiffs in the case are more than 100 US citizens and their families who were killed or wounded in the October 7 attacks at the Nova music festival and in several of the kibbutzes and towns near the Gaza Strip. One of the plaintiffs, Nahar Neta, is the son of California native Adrienne Neta, who was killed during Hamas\u2019 attack on Kibbutz Be\u2019eri. \u201cWhile nothing will ever undo the unbearable pain Hamas caused our family or the brutal losses we\u2019ve suffered, we hope this case will bring some sense of justice. It\u2019s important for us to be able to tell our stories so the world can hear how Hamas has terrorized Israel, the Jewish people, and many American citizens,\u201d Neta said in a statement issued through the ADL. \u201cMy mom devoted her life to caring for others regardless of race or religious beliefs. She was a peace and justice seeker who was active in many civilian efforts to bridge the gap between Jews and Arabs in Israel.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/world/us-victims-iran-syria-north-korea-hamas-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_middleeast_ultra-orthodox-in-israel-defy-orders-to-serve-in-military-mime-intl", "text": "As thousands of men hurried towards the main square in Jerusalem\u2019s ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim on Sunday for a protest, they passed signs declaring \u201cwar\u201d on a contentious order from Israel\u2019s highest court. The Supreme Court ruling on June 25 said the Israeli government must enlist draft-age ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) Jews into the military, reversing a de facto exemption in place since the country\u2019s founding 76 years ago. Sunday\u2019s rally in Shabbat Square, which drew thousands, was to demonstrate against the decision, which another poster said had \u201cthrust a sword\u201d through the \u201cbeit midrash,\u201d or Torah study hall. The protest highlighted the fault line in Israeli society between ultra-Orthodox Jews, who Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu relies on to maintain his government, and other Israelis, many of whom believe that all Jewish citizens should serve in the military, especially during wartime. Many Haredi men spend much of their early lives out of the workforce, instead studying at religious schools known as yeshivas that are partly funded through government subsidies. For many Haredis, the idea that they would be pulled from studying scripture and drafted into Israel\u2019s military is simply out of the question. An arrangement made during Israel\u2019s founding exempted several hundred Haredi men from conscription. However, the community has since grown exponentially, allowing tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox men to now avoid the draft. \u201cWe will not enlist,\u201d said Yosef, 22, who traveled to the protest from his home in Beitar Illit, a large Haredi settlement in the occupied West Bank. \u201cSince the beginning of the state (of Israel), we have not enlisted\u2026 Now they want to make us (serve) by force. It will never work,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a democratic state there is not much they can do besides put us in prison. We are not afraid of prison. We laugh about prison\u2026 and the more people that go into prison, the more demonstrations there will be in the country.\u201d As Yosef spoke, he looked up at a group of boys climbing a ladder to a nearby lamppost to hang a sign that read: \u201cWe will not enlist in the army.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t watch as they tear the Torah to shreds,\u201d said another man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, due to the cultural norms of his community, some of whom are not open to speaking to the press. \u201cWe can\u2019t be quiet. The High Court, the government, all the Knesset (parliament)\u2026 they are looking for ways for compromise and to send Haredi boys to be destroyed. We will die rather than be enlisted.\u201d The clashes between some protesters and police following the gathering in Mea Shearim \u00a0underscored the depth of emotion in the ultra-Orthodox community, many of whom believe that serving in the military is incompatible with their way of life. Some ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods like Mea Shearim shun modern technology. A man at Sunday\u2019s protest held a placard stating: \u201cLife is happy only without internet and films.\u201d Five people were arrested in confrontations after some threw rocks, set trash cans on fire and attacked the car of Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, himself a Haredi Jew. \u2018God is going to help them\u2019 But Haredi journalist Yanki Farber told CNN in a telephone interview ahead of the protest that although the protesters in Mea Shearim would be among the most \u201cextreme\u201d of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox communities, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u2014 requiring the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to recruit all Israeli men equally \u2014 had left the wider community reeling. He said that for many Haredis, the court\u2019s decision won\u2019t change their stance, adding that many said they would \u201cneed to starve because they\u2019re not going to have money to buy food,\u201d referring to the court\u2019s edict that the government must withdraw funding from any yeshivas whose students do not comply with draft notices. \u201cThey still refuse to join the Israeli army. They (say they) are just not worried about it. And they trust in God, that God is going to help them,\u201d said Farber, who writes for the ultra-Orthodox Hadrei Haredim website. Given that most other Israeli Jews are required to serve in the military, the Haredi exemption, \u201cwhile relying on disproportionate government subsidies,\u201d has fostered significant resentment among non-Haredi Jews,\u00a0according to the Israel Policy Forum. The issue came to a head after Israel invaded Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack, when the IDF initiated the largest mandatory military mobilization since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Some lawmakers in Netanyahu\u2019s own coalition have joined the opposition in pushing for the Haredi community to enlist. Despite the court ruling, the military is unlikely to immediately call-up all draft-age Haredi men. The Attorney General\u2019s office said the IDF \u201chad committed to recruiting 3,000 yeshiva students in the current recruitment year.\u201d Amichai Milici, a 45-year-old army veteran and father of seven who now studies full-time at a yeshiva, said the IDF isn\u2019t ready to absorb more ultra-Orthodox men yet. \u201cThey don\u2019t have synagogues (in the military), they don\u2019t have places to learn the Torah, there are girls all over the place,\u201d he told CNN, adding that some fear that enlisting would make the Haredis less religious. \u201cThe people are afraid\u2026 When they go to the army, who says they are going to be religious after that? After three years, he ain\u2019t going to be with kippah.\u201d He insists that any man who wants to study the Torah should remain exempt from military service, arguing that religious studies and the defense of Israel are intertwined and essential for the nation\u2019s well-being. \u201cThe study of the Torah is central to the existence of the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Jewish need the army and need the Torah\u2026 The Torah is giving power to the soldiers, and the soldiers are giving power to the Torah.\u201d Rabbis losing influence Many fear that mass enlistment could change the way of life in their insular neighborhoods. Farber, the Haredi journalist who once served in the IDF, said ultra-Orthodox rabbis may be worried about losing their influence. \u201cThe Haredi leaders, spiritual leaders\u2026 are very, very afraid that they are going to see thousands of young Haredi boys in uniform in (ultra-) Orthodox neighborhoods,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are afraid that being a soldier in the Haredi community will become something normal. And if you go into the IDF, you (might) start getting different ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou start opening your head to other opinions\u2026 and nobody\u2019s going to listen to the rabbis anymore.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party said in response to the Supreme Court ruling that it hoped to pass a \u201chistoric conscription law\u201d which would \u201csignificantly increase the recruitment rates\u201d of ultra-Orthodox men but also \u201crecognize the importance of Torah study\u201d \u2014 raising the possibility of the exemption continuing for a smaller number of yeshiva students. But a source in the political opposition told CNN they did not believe any bill on the matter that could secure the necessary majority support in the Knesset would be acceptable to Netanyahu\u2019s ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, for whom this was the \u201cnumber one issue.\u201d \u201cIn terms of legislative process (we are) stuck,\u201d the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive political matters candidly, said. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they (the Ministry of Defense) forcefully tried to recruit people against their will, even though it\u2019s the law. But it puts them in a very difficult spot now because the court ruling was so clear.\u201d The source said it was unclear what would happen to draft-dodgers. Prison is the final step in a process that starts with denying passport issuances and holding back benefits. \u201cSo it could be that we see that sort of process for a large number of ultra-Orthodox men. How much that impacts their lives, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/middleeast/ultra-orthodox-in-israel-defy-orders-to-serve-in-military-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

North Korea launched two ballistic missiles on Monday morning, according to reports from the South Korean, American and Japanese governments. The missiles, launched at 5:05 a.m. and 5:15 a.m. local time, had two different flight distances, 600 kilometers (373 miles) for the first and 120 kilometers (75 miles) for the second, according to a statement from South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). When asked about the disparate distances, Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for the JCS, in a briefing said, \u201cThere is the possibility that the second launched missile had an abnormal flight in the early stage.\u201d \u201cIf it had exploded during an abnormal flight, there is the possibility that debris fell inland,\u201d Lee said, clarifying that an \u201cexplosion\u201d is one of many possibilities. The military is \u201ccomprehensively analyzing\u201d various possibilities. He added that no damage has been confirmed so far. South Korea said the first missile, with the 600-kilometer (373-mile) flight distance, was a short-range ballistic missile, but Lee would only say the second was \u201ca ballistic missile,\u201d which leaves open the possibility of it being a new weapon. According to JCS, the two missiles were launched northeastward from the Changyon-gun area of South Hwanghae province, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) southwest of Pyongyang. If the missile exploded after flying 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeastward from Changyon-gun, the debris could have landed near Pyongyang, based on the distance traveled from the launch site. The JCS could not confirm whether there was an explosion near the capital, which is North Korea\u2019s largest city and home to more than 3 million people. Last week, North Korea said it successfully conducted a\u00a0test to deploy multiple warheads from a single-stage engine for a medium- to long-range ballistic missile, marking an important milestone in upgrading its missile technology. South Korea later said the North Korean claim was false. Lee, the JCS spokesperson, said that during a successful test, multiple warheads should separate from a missile during the descending stage of its flight, but North Korea\u2019s missile had exploded in the early stage during launch. North Korea did not make any statements after Monday morning\u2019s launches, but on Sunday put out a statement on the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) denouncing the recent US-South Korea-Japan military exercises named \u201cFreedom Edge,\u201d calling it another sign of the three partners \u201creckless and provocative military muscle-flexing.\u201d The statement said North Korea would \u201ccontinue to make important efforts to deter the acts of disturbing peace and stability\u201d on the Korean Peninsula. Technically the two Koreas\u00a0remain at war\u00a0\u2013 an armistice ended the Korean War that split the peninsula in 1953 but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Relations between the two countries thawed somewhat in 2017 and 2018, but the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years as leader Kim ramped up weapons testing in defiance of United Nations sanctions and diplomatic talks fell apart. Meanwhile, both nations are drawing closer to their respective partners \u2013 with North Korea recently signing a defense agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0and South Korea stepping up cooperation with Japan and the United States. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Monday\u2019s missile tests, which occurred during ongoing meetings of the Central Committee of the ruling Worker\u2019s Party, likely served two purposes for the Kim regime. \u201cIn both North Korean politics and military policy, the best defense is often a good offense. These missile launches are likely the Kim regime\u2019s way of compensating for recent failed tests, aiming to impress a domestic audience during ruling party meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cPyongyang is also determined not to appear weak while South Korea conducts defense exercises with Japan and the United States.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/asia/north-korea-failed-missile-test-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

The primary reason is overfishing; shark meat and fins are highly sought. \u201cThey are being killed at a rate that cannot be sustained in the future,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. Scientists worry the sharks\u2019 dwindling numbers could bring ecological collapse as they play a number of key roles in the ocean. Unlike many fish, sharks take a long time to reproduce. Fisheries kill about 100 million sharks a year, according to the non-profit Save Our Seas. Many sharks end up as bycatch when long lines and gill nets unintentionally catch them. The largest demand that drives the international trade is shark fin soup.\u00a0\u201cShark finning is problematic because when you remove the fins from a shark and you put it back in the water, it\u2019s just like a rock or a log just falling to the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. \u201cIf they cannot swim, they will suffocate to death.\u201d Hammerheads are one of the of the most critically endangered sharks- having lost 80% of their population in just the last three decades. \u201cTheir fins are big and really good quality,\u201d said the scientist. \u201cThat means they\u2019re thick and they have these cartilaginous filaments that are used in the shark fin soup.\u201d In recent years, demand has also risen for shark meat- a cheap protein consumed throughout Europe and South America. A small DNA tool makes a big difference Today Carde\u00f1osa is fighting the illegal trade of endangered sharks as a Distinguished Postdoctoral scholar at Florida International University in Miami. The marine biologist is using molecular and forensic tools to combat smuggling that stretches from Hong Kong to Latin America. One of the biggest challenges for law enforcement at ports around the world is determining whether shipments of shark fins and meat are violating CITES- The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. \u201cA lot of the fins look the same,\u201d explained Carde\u00f1osa. \u201cHow can you tell whether a shark fin that is coming into the country is legal or illegal, is from a species that is regulated or not regulated?\u201d Carde\u00f1osa, along with fellow FIU adjunct professor Demian Chapman, came up with a portable DNA kit that looks like a small red cube. It identifies species and country of origin of shark fins and meat coming into ports. \u201cWe take a little piece of this fin, we run it through a machine for two hours, and we\u2019re able to tell what species it is without sequencing very cheaply, very quickly.\u201d For years, port authorities were sending samples off-site to labs for testing that came back days if not a week later- slowing down the seizures. Their technology is now used in the shark trade\u2019s busiest ports: Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Spain, Belize, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. Carde\u00f1osa said it has helped Hong Kong authorities go from seizing an average of five tons of shark fins annually before 2018 to one hundred tons since they started using the tool. His DNA toolkits have also helped stop illegal shipments of European eels and South America\u2019s matamata turtles, earning the marine scientist Interpol\u2019s Directorate of Criminal Investigation and Interpol medal. A decade of pounding pavement leads to international shark protections Carde\u00f1osa and a team of Hong Kong scientists have surveyed fish markets for a decade to determine the source of their shark meat and fins. Using DNA, they\u2019ve tested more than 15,000 samples in Hong Kong and mainland China and discovered a whopping two-thirds of what\u2019s being sold in those markets are from threatened shark species. \u201cWe\u2019re removing and trading some of the ones that are the most critically endangered in the ocean,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. That research has helped expand the number of shark species now regulated by CITES. Governments that sign on to the agreement must require permits for every shipment of shark products that moves through their ports, ensuring the trade is legal, traceable and sustainable. Carde\u00f1osa said when he got started in the field, there were only five or six shark species regulated by the CITES agreement. Today there are more than 150 sharks and rays covered. Carde\u00f1osa also discovered through genetic tracing that 85% of the fins at those markets belong to sharks caught in the Eastern Pacific, which stretches from Baja, California south through Central and South America to Peru- including Carde\u00f1osa\u2019s home country, Colombia. \u201cThe vast majority of the markets and the fisheries for sharks around the world are unsustainable, unmanaged, unregulated and sometimes illegal,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. The scientist is working with fishermen in South America \u2013 some of whom rely on fishing all kinds of marine life for their livelihoods. He\u2019s teaching them ways to fish sustainably \u2013 without dangerous long lines and gillnets \u2013 and how to protect known endangered shark populations. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to identify areas where those hammerhead sharks spend the majority of the time and make agreements with them to not fish those locations.\u201d Carde\u00f1osa says good management of shark fisheries \u201cis a really hard task to do. Everybody is trying to find a way to do it.\u201d He also enlists those local fishermen to help him. \u201cWe teach them how to collect data and bring them in as part of our projects to help.\u201d The shark scientist is also trying to convince more countries to sign on to the CITES convention on sharks. How you can help sharks One of the easiest ways to help sharks and all marine life is to try to consume seafood from sustainable sources. There are a number of online resources and apps for that including the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. Just 4% of global shark catches are sustainable \u2013 so it\u2019s generally not a good idea to consume sharks. Additionally, their dense meat often contains a lot of mercury. \u201cThat will go to our lab and our programs to fund these projects and really have an impact on a global scale.\u201d You can also donate to the research Carde\u00f1osa is conducting through the FIU Foundation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/world/a-third-of-sharks-are-threatened-with-extinction-heres-what-one-man-is-doing-to-help-iyw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_03_style_anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-preview-intl-hnk", "text": "Billionaire heir Anant Ambani is set to marry his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant later this month, in a lavish ceremony widely described as the country\u2019s wedding of the year. Extravagant pre-wedding celebrations have already sent Indian media into a frenzy and social media feeds are abuzz over what\u2019s to come. In March, the couple had a three-day pre-wedding party in the western city of Jamnagar, attended by around 1,200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. An elaborate light show featuring 5,500 drones lit up the sky above a glass palace custom-built for the festivities where partygoers danced the night away to a performance by none other than Rihanna. Then, over a weekend in late May, the couple held a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, which made multiple stops through Europe, and included a bevy of Bollywood A-listers, with performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and opera star Andrea Bocelli. The Mumbai wedding is set to take place July 12 to 14 at the home of Anant\u2019s parents Mukesh and Nita Ambani \u2013 a 27-story residence called Antilia \u2013 as well as the family-owned Jio World Convention Centre, a sprawling venue with a capacity for more than 16,000 people. Details have been tightly guarded, but if the pre-wedding events are anything to go by, the upcoming nuptials are expected to be grand. Here\u2019s what we know. Who are the bride and groom? Ambani, 29, is the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who has an estimated fortune of $118 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His son is responsible for driving the expansion of the energy sector of the family\u2019s conglomerate, Reliance Industries. The youngest of three siblings, Ambani graduated from Brown University. His brother and sister are on the board of Reliance and manage other parts of the company. Anant has been concerned about animal welfare since childhood. He recently launched his passion project, Vantara, a 3,000-acre animal shelter, which was toured by VIP guests dressed in jungle-themed attire during the pre-wedding party in Jamnagar. Merchant, 29, is the daughter of pharma tycoon Viren Merchant, and works for his company, Encore Healthcare. A graduate of New York University, she told Vogue that she met Ambani through mutual friends during a drive in 2017. \u201cThat first meeting just sparked something special between us, and it wasn\u2019t long before we started dating,\u201d she said.  Merchant is also formally trained in Bharatnatyam, a form of Indian classical dance. Speaking of his wife to-be, Ambani said during a speech in Jamnagar: \u201cI am 100% the lucky one. It feels like I met Radhika yesterday, but every day, I fall more and more in love.\u201d What can we expect at the wedding? In keeping with Hindu tradition, the couple\u2019s wedding dates were reportedly chosen according to auspicious days on their birth charts. Hindu weddings typically include several events and take place over more than one day. The festivities usually include a haldi ceremony, where guests apply turmeric paste on the bride and groom\u2019s arms and face for good luck and protection from evil spirits. Then there\u2019s the mehndi, a ritual where an artist paints intricate henna patterns on to the hands of the bride and guests. The night before the wedding is usually reserved for the sangeet, when the bride and groom\u2019s wedding party dances for guests. According to a leaked wedding invitation posted by ANI, one of India\u2019s largest news agencies, festivities will kick off on July 12 with the \u201cShubh Vivaah\u201d or \u201causpicious wedding\u201d ceremony. The following day is the \u201cShubh Aashirwad\u201d or \u201cdivine blessing\u201d ceremony, and festivities conclude on July 14 with the \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d or reception. The invitation was placed in an ornate red box with a depiction of the Hindu god Vishnu on its front, according to a video published by ANI. Manish Malhotra, one of the country\u2019s most famous designers, has been appointed as the wedding\u2019s creative director, collaborating with Nita Ambani and numerous vendors to execute the family\u2019s vision. Malhotra told CNN that he built on Nita\u2019s \u201cvisionary approach,\u201d with his team creating themes and experiences for the wedding that \u201cembody the essence of India while reflecting the couple\u2019s distinct personalities.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he explained via e-mail. What can we expect from the wedding fashion? The bride and groom are expected to wear statement-making attire showcasing Indian craft and textiles, homegrown talent as well as pieces imbued with symbolism. The couple\u2019s outfits worn in the pre-wedding events included striking pieces from top Indian designers, such as Malhotra, Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Tarun Tahiliani. Malhotra designed two lehengas that Merchant wore to the pre-wedding bash. The golden garment was studded with 20,000 Swarovski crystals and employed the knowledge of over 70 artisans while an Art Deco inspired blue lehenga took 5,700 hours to make. Ambani\u2019s looks have also been bold. At one of the events in Jamnagar, he wore an ivory sherwani, a traditional Indian two-piece suit, designed by Rohit Bal, with a custom brooch by Lorraine Schwartz. Luxury\u00a0fashion labels have been seen alongside up-and-coming labels. Merchant wore Versace during the March celebrations \u2014 a custom pink version of the gown previously worn by Blake Lively at the 2022 Met Gala. On the Mediterranean cruise, Merchant wore a black and white gown designed by Hong Kong-born Robert Wun, with a love letter from her fiance printed onto the chiffon skirt. Coordinating with Merchant, Ambani also wore a custom black suit designed by Wun, encrusted with jewels. For the July wedding, Malhotra said his team has \u201cdedicated several months of meticulous craftsmanship to create exquisite pieces.\u201d While he was unable to reveal the details of the garments ahead of the occasion, he said work on some of them began before the pre-wedding celebrations. At the upcoming wedding, guests are expected to dress in \u201ctraditional Indian\u201d attire on Friday, according to the wedding invitation, which could include a saree for women, and a kurta \u2013 loosely fitted pants with a tunic \u2013 for men. Guests have been asked to wear \u201cIndian formal\u201d attire the following day and \u201cIndian chic\u201d for Sunday\u2019s reception event. Malhotra described the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code as something that \u201cmarries traditional Indian elements with contemporary fashion.\u201d For the couple, he said, this translates into \u201cstriking ensembles that honor our rich cultural heritage while reflecting their personal style. Think of intricate embroidery and innovative silhouettes that capture both tradition and modernity.\u201d As for the guests, Malhotra said, we can expect to see \u201ctimeless sarees and lehengas paired with modern blouses, or traditional sherwanis with a contemporary twist. \u201cThe key is to celebrate Indian craftsmanship while embracing a sophisticated, stylish aesthetic that feels both timeless and fresh.\u201d What it takes to pull off a wedding on this scale An event of this magnitude takes months to plan and likely involves hundreds of people working behind the scenes to make it happen. \u201cAny kind of mega project like this usually requires about nine to 12 months of preparation work, and there is the involvement of nearly 40 to 45 big agencies or partners,\u201d Mareesha Parikh, a Mumbai-based wedding planner and founder of Swaaha Weddings, told CNN on a phone call. Separate teams will likely be dealing with reservations, securing entertainment, managing production design, handling logistics, among others tasks on the day, she added. India\u2019s wedding industry has dramatically evolved over the last decade, with Bollywood and celebrity culture inspiring couples to throw grander and even more expensive affairs. But with the intense public fascination with Ambani and Merchant\u2019s wedding, also comes some criticism. To some, the opulence of the event stands in stark contrast to the poverty affecting tens of millions in the country, and points to what critics say is an increasing wealth gap between the rich and poor. The Ambanis, aware of their privilege, have carried out charitable acts before some of the celebrations. On Tuesday, they staged a mass wedding for 50 \u201cunderprivileged\u201d couples in the city, gifting them jewellery as well as household items and groceries for a year. Now valued at\u00a0around $130 billion,\u00a0according to the Confederation of All India Traders,\u00a0the wedding sector is country\u2019s fourth largest industry, employing millions of people. In December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a \u201cwed in India\u201d campaign to keep the money spent on weddings inside the country. \u201cAreas of specialization have also grown,\u201d Parikh said. \u201cTake gift hampers for example. We used to source those and wrap them ourselves. Now there\u2019s a separate agency that does the sourcing and a separate agency that does the packaging.\u201d Vanessa Almeida, the Goa-based owner of The Gift House, who was responsible for packaging some 8,000 gifts for Ambani\u2019s guests in Jamnagar told CNN she was in the city for two weeks to ensure all the preparations were going to plan. \u201cDuring the event, we were asked not to take photos of the event, of the people or of the work that we were doing,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cThey had very respectfully even asked the guests not to do so as they had their own teams capturing everything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/style/anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-preview-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

I saw very considerable achievements in the fighting being carried in Rafah. We are advancing to the end of the stage of eliminating the Hamas terrorist army; we will continue striking its remnants,\u201d Netanyahu said, speaking to a group of mainly Israeli and international military officials studying at the National Security College. He again vowed that Israel would achieve its goals in its war against Hamas: returning hostages from Gaza, eliminating Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities, ensuring that Gaza will not constitute a threat against Israel and also returning displaced Israeli residents securely to their homes in both the south and the north. Before launching a military operation in Rafah in May, Israeli leaders had maintained that the southern Gaza city was the last stronghold of Hamas. Netanyahu said last month that the \u201cintense phase of the war with Hamas (in Gaza) is about to end,\u201d and that the military\u2019s focus could then shift to Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the war is going to end, but the war in its current stage is going to end in Rafah.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_07_02_weather_july-fourth-forecast-extreme-heat-climate", "text": "Grills won\u2019t be the only thing sizzling this Fourth of July as uncomfortable, potentially dangerous heat sets in for millions in the US. This summer started off unusually hot and is largely expected to stay that way, as forecasts show only fleeting moments of respite in the weeks ahead. Summertime heat will be in place for much of the Lower 48 for Independence Day as the US enters its hottest time of the year. But temperatures for two large sections of the country are expected to far exceed those typical of early July. Heat will ramp up in parts of the West and southern US this week, culminating in temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal in California and Oregon on Thursday and 5 to 10 degrees above normal from Texas and Oklahoma to the Carolinas. High temperatures in the 100s and 110s will hit parts of California\u2019s Central Valley while desert areas in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will approach 115 degrees. Sacramento \u2014 which just experienced its fourth-hottest June on record \u2014 could come close to its hottest Fourth of July with a high near 107 degrees Thursday. Las Vegas could come within a couple degrees of its hottest-ever Independence Day when the mercury tops out around 112. Heat has been relentless for the city \u2014 this June was also its hottest on record. While Thursday won\u2019t be record-hot for Phoenix, temperatures in the city are expected to climb around 7 degrees above its normal high of about 107. Thursday is also likely to be the third day in a row where temperatures exceed the 110 degree mark for the city \u2014 a streak that will continue into next week. Thursday will be very hot for parts of the West but even higher temperatures are expected to follow. Brutal heat will expand into much of the Pacific Northwest on Friday and keep temperatures sky-high across California and the desert Southwest. Portland, Oregon, will swelter as temperatures climb into the mid-90s Thursday and soar to near 100 degrees on Friday \u2014 about 25 degrees hotter than normal. The South will also bake Thursday, but it won\u2019t quite reach the extremes the West will endure. High temperatures in the 90s will be widespread in the Southern states, with parts of Texas and Oklahoma set to reach into the low 100s. Dallas will climb to around 101 degrees Thursday, likely marking the fourth day in a row of the thermometer hitting triple digits. Typically, the metro should have a high of around 94 for Independence Day. Farther east, Atlanta should normally top out at around 88 degrees on the Fourth of July, but the city is expected to reach 94 degrees this time around. The heat comes after the city recorded 11 days in a row of temperatures at or above 90 degrees to the end of June and recorded its first 100 degree reading in nearly five years. Humidity will make the heat feel even worse in the South, sending heat index values \u2014 how hot the air actually feels to the body \u2014 over 100 degrees for millions. Dangerous heat index values coupled with outdoor activity for the holiday could result in heat-related illnesses without the proper precautions. In addition to the heat, Mother Nature will also provide her own Fourth of July fireworks. Thunderstorms will rumble over portions of the Mississippi Valley and Midwest from the morning hours onward as a cold front digs southward across the regions. Thunderstorms are also possible from parts of the Ohio Valley to the Northeast. As the day progresses, some severe thunderstorms are possible, mainly in parts of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas during the afternoon and evening. These storms could unload damaging wind gusts, hail, heavy rain and even a tornado or two. Any storms that linger into the evening hours could disrupt fireworks displays. Rain may prevent organizers from launching fireworks and any lightning strikes will make it dangerous for large crowds to be outdoors. Major fireworks shows in Washington, DC, Philadelphia and New York City may have to deal with storms Thursday evening.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/weather/july-fourth-forecast-extreme-heat-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd", "text": "Pollsters were surprised by the burst of populism in 2016, but many now think they shouldn\u2019t have been. In the United States and United Kingdom, swaths of voters in deprived regions \u2013 places \u201cleft behind\u201d by globalization \u2013 were given the chance to stick it to the system, and they took it. Why was anyone surprised? Pollsters have now been surprised by another trend. In this month\u2019s European Parliament elections, far-right parties performed predictably well \u2013 but especially, and unexpectedly, among young people. A few years ago, \u201cGeneration Climate\u201d \u2013 thought to be unquestionably liberal and progressive \u2013 were voting mostly green. But now, their vote has helped far-right parties capture one in four seats in Brussels. What happened? Perhaps the \u201cleft behind\u201d is not only a geographical phenomenon, but generational. Gen-Z - those born between 1995 and 2012 - has been baptized in crises: first the financial, then the eurozone, then of the pandemic and now of war in Europe. More and more young people believe they will have harder lives than their parents. Why should a left-behind generation be less vulnerable to the lure of populism than left-behind places? Roberto Foa, co-director of the Centre for the Future of Democracy at the University of Cambridge, a leading researcher of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, sees \u201ctwo big divides\u201d in Western societies: \u201cThe wealth divide between economically successful and left-behind regions, and the intergenerational divide in life opportunities.\u201d Political scientists may have overlooked both cohorts because they have long been disconnected. But now their apathy is turning into antipathy \u2013 a desire, once more, to stick it to the system. \u201cIf you are a political entrepreneur who is seeking to break the established party system, those are your options, in terms of mobilizing fresh support,\u201d Foa told CNN. The trend, he says, has been a long time coming: \u201cI\u2019m surprised that people are surprised.\u201d Youth support for far-right parties is being felt in several European countries. In Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), won 16% of the under-25 vote in the EU elections \u2013 tripling its share in that demographic from the previous vote in 2019. Among French voters under 34, the National Rally (RN) was the most popular party, with 32% of the vote \u2013 a 10-point rise compared to 2019. In Poland, 30% of under-30 voters supported the far-right Confederation party, up from 18.5% in 2019. Far-right parties enjoyed a similar uptick in support in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria, and continued to do well in Italy. How alarmed \u2013 and surprised \u2013 should mainstream parties be? Generation, not geography Consider these policy proposals. Young people will pay no income tax. If they start a business, they will be exempt from corporation tax for five years. Students working part-time will have their wages topped up by the state, which will also build 100,000 units of student housing. They can also travel by train for free. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking this must be the platform of the far left. But no: This was RN doyenne Marine Le Pen\u2019s offer in the 2022 French presidential election, which she narrowly lost. Young people, unsurprisingly, loved it. Just under 50% of 25-to-34-year-olds who cast a vote opted for Le Pen, compared to just 41% of the general population and 29% of voters over 70. Whereas the \u201cgray vote\u201d took Donald Trump to the White House and Britain from the EU, it kept the French far right at bay. That may soon change. After his Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right in the EU elections, President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election, which could result in Jordan Bardella, the RN\u2019s 28-year-old leader, becoming France\u2019s prime minister next month. For Arthur Prevot, manager of the RN\u2019s youth wing in Paris, this is great news. Macron\u2019s presidency has failed to deliver for young people, he says. \u201cPurchasing power has decreased incredibly over the past seven years. Between the \u2018gilets jaunes\u2019 crisis, the rise in fuel prices, and all the different taxes that have been introduced \u2013 all of this impacts daily life, including mine,\u201d Prevot, 22, told CNN. His economic concerns prompted him to join the party which may soon govern France, although Macron will remain president. Jonathan Verbeken, a deputy RN candidate in Paris\u2019 15th district, said the main reason he joined the party was because, \u201cwe see people suffering daily, struggling to make ends meet. We see a deplorable situation in France, specifically with security and immigration. We want to react to that.\u201d To many older voters, the RN remains a terrifying prospect. Despite its years-long effort to \u201cnormalize,\u201d previous generations remember its antisemitic, neofascist origins. But young voters appear less concerned by these roots, says Simon Schnetzer, author of a recent survey of Germany\u2019s youth. \u201cYoung people are first-time voters. They are a blank sheet. What drives their decisions most is: Who can offer me something that best fits my needs?\u201d he told CNN. The lack of historical baggage, coupled with the strange death of center-left parties in many parts of Europe, has allowed the far right to appear respectable and armed with economic solutions to young people\u2019s problems. Sarah-Lee Heinrichs, a 23-year-old politician for the German Green Party, said economic concerns have become far more prevalent among young people since the last European Parliament elections in 2019, when the Greens became the second largest party in Germany for the first time. In the wake of the pandemic, the full-scale war in Ukraine and the return of soaring inflation, environmentalism is no longer young people\u2019s priority, she says. \u201cIf governments don\u2019t provide social security \u2013 good jobs and a place to live that doesn\u2019t cost more than 50% of your income every month \u2013 then the far-right will rise,\u201d Heinrichs told CNN. And with economic insecurity is coming fiercer opposition to immigration, nearly a decade after the continent \u2013 and especially Germany - welcomed a record number of refugees fleeing war in Syria. An alarming new trend began last month, after a short clip filmed on the German vacation island of Sylt was posted on X. In the video, well-dressed German youths belt out \u201cAusl\u00e4nder Raus!\u201d (\u201cforeigners out!\u201d) and \u201cDeutschland den Deutschen!\u201d (\u201cGermany for Germans!\u201d) over a 1999 Eurodance beat. The chant has since swirled across the country, currently hosting the European soccer championships. Its appeal is not confined to Germans. As Italy played Spain last week, fans in the stadium could be heard giving their own rendition. Swiping right If that\u2019s the \u201cdemand\u201d side, what about the supply? After her center-right bloc secured the most seats in the European Parliament, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen took to the stage in Brussels to give a victory speech. But her tone was more somber than victorious. She spoke of the importance of defending European values: integration, democracy and the rule of law. How do these abstract values sound to young voters? \u201cYoung people will double check, does that help me with any of my needs? Does it entertain me? Does it give me security? Is it fun? And if it\u2019s none of that, it\u2019s boring,\u201d said Schnetzer. \u201cIf you have this TikTok logic, you\u2019ll quickly swipe further.\u201d While Europe\u2019s mainstream gives grave speeches, the far right is developing vast followings on social media platform TikTok. The RN\u2019s clean-shaven Bardella posts videos of himself wine tasting and doing shots. Maximilian Krah, the AfD\u2019s lead candidate going into\u00a0the EU elections, offers his followers dating advice: \u201cDon\u2019t watch porn, don\u2019t vote for the Greens.\u201d In one TikTok, Nigel Farage \u2013 often described as the \u201carchitect\u201d of Brexit \u2013 approaches a fruit store, says \u201clovely melons,\u201d raises his eyebrows and walks off. The clip has been viewed 2.5 million times. Farage seems aware of this burgeoning market and keen to exploit it. In a recent interview, he praised misogynist online influencer Andrew Tate for being an \u201cimportant voice\u201d for \u201cemasculated\u201d young boys. Tate \u2013 who has racked up billions of views on TikTok \u2013 is facing charges in Romania of human trafficking and rape, which he denies. But those who have puzzled over Tate\u2019s appeal to young men should not be surprised that politicians making jokes about breasts enjoy similar success. The distinction between politicians and entertainment has long grown fuzzy \u2013 but for today\u2019s young, they no longer even exist in separate spaces. Just one swipe separates the voice of a figure like Tate and the voice of a politician. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised if here is where ideas are shaped. Thrill of the new It is not yet clear how deeply these far-right sympathies are held. In a trend especially pronounced among young people, voters are increasingly \u201cnot loyal to any particular party or platform,\u201d says Foa. \u201cThey\u2019re very volatile between one election and the next.\u201d Just as young voters campaigned vociferously for green parties in 2019, their allegiances could switch again. The appeal of the far right may also be dampened if its politicians begin to govern. Out of office, the far right is unable to break promises, while it can point endlessly to the mainstream\u2019s inability to deliver. Once in government, it will prove just as disappointing. That, at least, appears to be\u00a0Macron\u2019s theory. But the burst in support for far-right parties could spell a darker trend. In his studies of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, Foa noted a growing penchant for authoritarianism. Lacking a personal memory of life under authoritarian rule or the struggle to achieve democracy, young people are less enamored with the system than previous generations. This success of far-right parties should be a warning to Europe\u2019s mainstream. To Churchill\u2019s famous quote, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others,\u201d we should not be surprised if young people ask in reply: \u201cReally?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

Judge Balo\u00edsa Marqu\u00ednez ordered the lifting all the precautionary measures made against the defendants, who have not been named. She said one of the group had died during the process. The Panama Papers were a group of over 11 million leaked documents that were published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in 2016. The documents allegedly\u00a0revealed a clandestine network\u00a0involving associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and business ties between a member of\u00a0FIFA\u2019s ethics committee\u00a0and men whom the\u00a0United States had indicted for corruption. The papers referenced 12 current or former world leaders, as well as 128 other politicians and public officials. A court statement said that evidence collected in the case did not meet due process, casting doubt over its \u201cauthenticity and integrity.\u201d On Friday, the ICIJ\u2019s executive director Gerard Ryle said that \u201cwhile the court did not hold these defendants accountable, the enduring impact of our investigation persists.\u201d \u201cBy revealing hidden truths, as we did in the Panama Papers, we empower the public with information they need to demand accountability and push for reforms,\u201d Ryle said. The trial lasted 85 hours, the ICIJ said, and included three prosecutors and 18 defense lawyers. Operation Car Wash was a money laundering investigation into Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s state-run oil company.

{"id": "2024_07_02_asia_india-uttar-pradesh-crush-intl", "text": "A crowd crush at a religious gathering in northern India killed more than a hundred people Tuesday, mostly women, in one of the deadliest such incidents the country has seen in recent years. Many of the scores killed had fallen into an open sewer next to the venue. Police are investigating the organizers, saying a quarter of a million people arrived at the venue - more than three times the number expected - and just a few dozen police officers had been deployed. Investigators are pursuing Bhole Baba, the self-styled godman who led the event. The disaster happened at a prayer meeting, known as a satsang, in Mughal Garhi village in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state. The village, in Hathras district, is around 200 kilometers (124 miles) southeast of the capital New Delhi. At least 121 people died and 35 others were injured, Sandeep Singh, the Minister of State for Education, told reporters Wednesday, after a large number of people rushed to touch Bhole Baba\u2019s feet, leading to a crush. Almost all those killed were women, Singh said earlier, with at least seven children also among the dead. About 72 bodies have been identified so far, and dozens of injured people are being treated in nearby hospitals, according to local health officials. Local officials have suggested overcrowding was the cause of the crush. An estimated 80,000 people had been expected to attend the event, where Bhole Baba was giving a sermon. However, \u201ca lot more people showed up,\u201d Singh said. Police have been on the hunt for Bhole Baba since the deadly incident and have accused the event\u2019s organizers of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, wrongfully restraining a person, causing disappearance of evidence or providing false information, according to a police report seen by CNN. \ufeffPermission was sought for the event with 80,000 attendees, however a crowd of more than 250,000 devotees gathered, the report said. Organizers and officials tried to direct the crowd as thousands attempted to leave and in the ensuing chaos dozens were trampled, it added. The report alleged that event organizers provided no assistance to the injured and attempted to cover up the incident by hiding the clothes and shoes that people had lost in the crush in a nearby field. About 40 policemen had been deployed to provide security at the event, additional director general of Agra police, Anupam Kulshreshtha, told reporters. The deadly scenes unfolded after the event had finished, when Bhole Baba\u2019s devotees rushed toward the stage to touch his feet, according to chief secretary Singh, who described scenes of chaos as people began to fall on top of each other and into an open sewer nearby. He accused the organizers of failing to comply with a list of requirements given by the district. A high-level inquiry has been launched to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident and a police report will be filed against the event organizers for allegedly exceeding permitted attendance levels, according to local officials. \u201cThere has been a major lapse on the part of the organizers. They will face a strict punishment,\u201d he said. Survivors spoke of the harrowing incident in its aftermath. \u201cPeople started falling one upon another, one upon another. Those who were crushed died. People there pulled them out,\u201d Shakuntala Devi told the Press Trust of India news agency, according to the Associated Press. Efforts are underway to provide the injured with medical care and arrangements are being made for post-mortem examinations at various locations, said Inspector General Shalabh Mathur, of the neighboring district Ambala Range. A video distributed by Reuters showed crowds gathering outside a hospital in the nearby Etah district, where distraught families cried for the victims. Medical personnel could be seen carrying people on stretchers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences in a parliamentary address. Modi said the government is conducting \u201crelief and rescue work\u201d and is coordinating with the state government. \u201cThe victims will be helped in every way,\u201d he said. Crowd crushes at religious gatherings in India are not uncommon, and deadly incidents have made headlines in the past, highlighting the lack of adequate crowd control and safety measures. A new year\u2019s crush in January 2022 at one of India\u2019s holiest shrines in Jammu, in the north of the country, killed at least a dozen people. In 2008, nearly 150 people who had gathered for a religious event in western India died in a hilltop crowd crush, and three years prior, more than 250 people were trampled to death during a pilgrimage in the western state of Maharashtra.

{"id": "2024_07_03_travel_denali-national-park-riley-wildfire", "text": "No date has been set for the reopening of a popular national park in Alaska after a rare active wildfire near the park\u2019s entrance was reported Sunday, officials said. Evacuation orders were issued for\u00a0Denali National Park and Preserve on Monday as crews began battling the Riley Fire, park officials said on\u00a0Facebook. Since then, the park has been closed, and it has no timeline for a reopening, park officials told CNN Tuesday. \u201cPark tour and transit bus service will remain suspended on Wednesday, July 3,\u201d the park posted late Tuesday. \u201cPark campgrounds will close at 11:00am on Wednesday.\u201d The wildfire had burned 388 acres and was 25% contained as of Tuesday evening, park officials said. But a bit of good news emerged Wednesday morning: \u201cCloudy skies and cooler temperatures are aiding firefighters and water-dropping aircraft,\u201d park officials said. \u201cHelicopters are able to maneuver through the Nenana River corridor to draw water from a nearby lake to make numerous water drops on the fire.\u201d More than 600,000 people visit the park every year, with most visiting in the summer, according to the National Park Service. Meanwhile, employees who were forced to evacuate from park housing are staying in the nearby town of Healy, the park said. The fire is extremely rare for that area because an active fire hasn\u2019t been there for 100 years, park officials told CNN. Although it hasn\u2019t caused any injuries or structural damage as of Tuesday, the Riley Fire is affecting local air quality conditions, park officials said. The blaze ignited as the nation grapples this week with more\u00a0extreme heat\u00a0\u2013 the deadliest form of weather globally and\u00a0one that makes wildfires more likely and destructive. Additional crews arrived at the Alaska preserve\ufeff on Tuesday to help combat the fire, according to park officials. Cloudy skies and cooler temperatures are aiding firefighters, the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s Alaska Fire Service said Tuesday on the state\u2019s interagency wildfire information website. \u201cThe fire has already burned through most of the black spruce in the area. It is now burning mostly hardwoods and brush, which helped moderate fire behavior,\u201d the Alaska Fire Service said. \u201cThe winds, which are typically channeled through the Nenana River corridor, have been uncharacteristically calm since the Riley Fire started on Sunday.\u201d The cause of the fire is unknown, and a fire investigator will be brought in to investigate, park officials said. The Riley Fire is one of 33 large wildfires currently burning across Alaska, spanning almost 300,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The Alaska wildfire season typically begins in late May and ends in late July, according to the National Park Service. On average,\u00a01 million acres burn statewide\u00a0every year, the park service says. \u201cPeak fire season period is now underway in Alaska, and conditions are expected to worsen under persisting and recurrent hot, dry air masses, combined with the long daylight period,\u201d the National Interagency Fire Center said Tuesday.
