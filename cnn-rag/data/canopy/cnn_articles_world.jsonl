The Olympic mascot \u2013 a cartoonish encapsulation of the host city\u2019s culture and history \u2013 is so important, designs are often selected and finalized years before the Games take place. According to the International Olympic Committee, the role of these quirky caricatures is to help spread a \u201cfestive atmosphere\u201d and embody the exuberant spirit of the event. Over the decades, the world has welcomed snowmen, sasquatches, cowboy-hat-wearing bears and aliens to the Olympic stage. This year, the mascot will take the form of a hat \u2014 specifically the distinctive red Phrygian cap worn by emancipated Roman slaves which became a symbol of freedom during the French Revolution. The first mascot was created in 1968 by designer Aline Lafargue for the Grenoble Winter Games in France. Affectionately named \u201cShuss,\u201d the character consists of a two-toned head and lightning-bolt shaped leg attached to skis. Despite holding the esteemed title of first ever mascot, Lafargue created and submitted her design for Shuss in just one night. To find a worthy representative, each host country will typically organize a submission call-out or contest. In 2014, a competition held by Russia in anticipation for the Sochi Winter Games received more than 24,000 drawings. The winners, a trio of arctic mammals intended to represent the three spots on the Olympic podium, were selected by a public vote with the results broadcast on Russian TV. But this hasn\u2019t always been the case: for the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, one of the first Olympic events to be heavily subsidized by corporate financing, Disney won the private bid for mascot design. Since these creatures are also pivotal to official merchandise, cute and cuddly have long been key metrics for any mascot\u2019s success. Merchandise of Beijing\u2019s\u00a0rotund panda mascot Bing Dwen Dwen\u00a0for the\u00a02022 Winter Games\u00a0sold \u201clike hotcakes,\u201d while Disney\u2019s bald eagle, Sam, was meticulously constructed to appear short, stubby and soft as opposed to realistic, pointed and ominous in order to appeal to children. And when illustrators have deviated, viewers have let them know. Ten years ago, Iris design agency produced two silver cyclops extra-terrestrials to usher in the London Games. \u201cIf these things had been in a \u201950\u2019s horror movie it would now be considered a classic,\u201d wrote one CNN reader in 2012. One mascot, the bear Misha, even went extra-terrestrial in 1978 when it went to space on the \u201cSoyuz\u201d rocket two years before the 1980 Moscow Games. Character design becomes especially important when the Games coincide with a unique moment in history. For example Sydney, Australia, the host country of the first Olympics of the millennium, commissioned three mascots for the first time in the Games\u2019 history. The three anime-style cartoons, Syd, Olly and Millie, were named in reference to Sydney, Olympics and Millennium \u2013 and t-shirts from this landmark Games are still circulating second-hand resale sites now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/style/olympic-mascot-design-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned. His office declined to give details, saying an official announcement was being prepared", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/style/fumihiko-maki-architect-dies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_sport_tahiti-summer-olympics-2024", "text": "The Olympic Games will be chock full of iconic images of Parisian landmarks \u2013 the Eiffel Tower, Versailles, the Pont Alexandre III bridge and H\u00f4tel des Invalides are all set to play a starring role. But one of the most stunning backdrops for the quadrennial competition won\u2019t be in Paris \u2013 or France for that matter. It won\u2019t even be in the same hemisphere. The world-famous waves off Teahupo\u2019o in Tahiti are set to be one of the most scenic and unique locations of the upcoming games, beginning when the island hosts the surfing competition that kicks off on July 27. The selection of Tahiti fulfills one of the pledges from Paris organizers, who promised to spread the Olympics throughout French territory. Tahiti became a French colony in 1880 and is now classified as an autonomous overseas country of the French Republic. While other cities across France are hosting soccer, basketball and other high-profile competitions, the choice to put the surfing competition in the largest island in French Polynesia has made for one of the most unique and controversial venues in this edition of the Olympics. But it\u2019s one that\u2019s well-known in the surfing community, as the swells off of the southwestern coast of Tahiti have long been a part of the stops on the competition circuit. Located roughly 9,700 miles and a 21-hour flight away from Paris, Teahupo\u2019o will make for one of the far-flung host cities for an Olympic event in history. \u201cThis is a magical place, and the waves in Teahupo\u2019o are breathtaking,\u201d said Paris 2024 President Tony Estanguet after a visit to the event site in 2022. \u201cOur vision has always been to provide the most spectacular conditions for the surfers and the sport. I have no doubt that Tahiti will deliver on that vision.\u201d Teahupo\u2019o was selected third on CNN\u2019s list of top 50 places to surf in the world in 2013, described as a short and intense ride that creates amazing waves for surfing. The name means \u201cWall of Heads\u201d and can be dangerous. Because the location of the Games\u2019 competition has long been on the worldwide surfing circuit, it\u2019s long had a wooden tower that is built for competitions in the lagoon off the coast. It\u2019s this judging tower \u2013 and the determination that it wasn\u2019t going to be compliant with the safety expectations of Olympic competition, notably refereeing and broadcast coverage \u2013 that has set off a controversy in Tahiti and surfing circles. Olympic organizers have instead built an aluminum tower in the lagoon that has become a source of scrutiny throughout the build-up to the Olympics. After initially announcing plans to build a 14-ton, 150-square-meter tower with room for 40 people, drinking water and wastewater connections, the Paris 2024 team announced last year that it would be scaling back the project following backlash. \u201cAs the current judges\u2019 tower does not meet current safety standards, it will no longer be used and must be replaced if Teahupo\u2019o is to continue to organise surfing events, whether for the Olympic Games or any other competition,\u201d organizers said in a November news release. \u201cThe second issue is that the tower must be able to guarantee good conditions for the refereeing of the competition, in particular by offering the judges the necessary visibility over the entire wave.\u201d The plans for the new aluminum tower were criticized for potentially causing damage to the delicate coral reef off Teahupo\u2019o at a time when global warming is already harming coral reefs around the world. Video posted last year by Save Teahupo\u2019o Reef showed a barge \u2013 being used to build the tower \u2013 stuck on the reef, as well as evidence of broken coral The tower had been ripped by some critics as a symbol of colonialism and accused the organizers of the event of not living up to their claims that the competition would be sustainable and environmentally friendly. Alexandra Dempsey, coral reef ecologist and CEO of Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation, said that the coral formation that makes Tahiti such an ideal place for professional surfing could be damaged by the tower. \u201cThe local communities there are incredibly passionate and culturally tied to the ocean, and particularly the reef systems and the reef systems there that caused the wave action in that area. And the perfect wave \u2026 is \u2026 a natural effect of how the reef is and has been naturally formed for millions of years,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cYou\u2019re really not only damaging the ecology of the reef, but also the structure that\u2019s been there, that\u2019s been able to create the wonderful waves that that site was chosen for. And we\u2019re not really sure what the outcomes or the fallout would be of damaging the reef system there,\u201d she added. There are over 1,000 species of fish and 150 species of coral in French Polynesia, according to Tahiti\u2019s tourism board. Threatened by the effects of climate change and mass tourism, the corals are a highly protected species. The Paris 2024 committee said in a November news release that other options had been considered \u2013 such as reinforcing the foundations of the current tower, certifying the existing tower and existing foundation as safe, building a new wooden tower and having the judges judge the competition either from the shore or from boat. All of those options were ruled out and the decision was made to construct a slimmed-down version of the new aluminum tower. \u201cThe protection of the natural environment at Teahupo\u2019o has always been a priority in the conception of all envisaged solutions for the site,\u201d the news release stated. \u201cAll development plans at Teahupo\u2019o have been studied to minimise impact on the environment. This has been the aim of all the studies carried out with a view of organising the Games, and in particular the environmental support mission during the design and construction phase of the new tower.\u201d \u201cThe new tower, less imposing and reduced in size and weight, installed on new permanent foundations, is the solution that will ensure the longevity of the tower and guarantee that future sporting events can be held at Teahupo\u2019o,\u201d organizers added. \u201cThis tower and the new foundations will be able to receive 10-year certification, which is essential for insurance purposes.\u201d The decision met with outrage from activists and condemnation from the International Surfing Association, the sport\u2019s world governing body. The new nine-ton, 50-square-meter, three-story tower is now sitting in the waters off Teahupo\u2019o and \u2013 as Surfer Magazine reported in April \u2013 is in an area that does not directly affect much of the coral, though the long-term effects have yet to be seen. \u201cThe area where the tower is built has very little coral. It\u2019s a flat shelf with small spread out corals heads and a few bigger rocks covered with coral,\u201d wrote Tim McKenna, a Tahiti-based photographer, in an Instagram post that showed photos of how the new tower looks after its construction. \u201cOver the years corals (have) even covered the previous concrete tower base structure.\u201d He added: \u201cThe new tower was never only for the Olympic Games. It\u2019s a collapsable tower that will be assembled every year for the duration of the event. \u201cThe aluminum structure designed and built exclusively in Tahiti can finally be certified for insurance and safety reasons. It\u2019s an investment the Tahitian government has made for the \u2026 next 20 years of surfing events at Teahupo\u2019o.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/sport/tahiti-summer-olympics-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_europe_keir-starmer-labour-prime-minister-profile-intl-cmd", "text": "Four-and-a-half years ago, Britain\u2019s Labour Party suffered its worst election defeat since 1935. The historic election victory of Boris Johnson in 2019 \u2013 which allowed him to finally implement Brexit \u2013 was supposed to mark another 10 years of Conservative rule in Britain, with Labour resigned to rebuild on the fringes of politics. Then Labour leader, the hard-left Jeremy Corbyn, was forced to resign and reluctantly hand his party to the centrist Keir Starmer, a former lawyer, knight of the realm and exactly the type of establishment figure that Corbyn and the far-left despise. In little over four years, Starmer has pulled off a once-impossible coup and dragged his Labour Party from the margins of British politics to a thumping victory in Thursday\u2019s general election. It will be the first time Labour has been in power since 2010 and the first time it has entered power from opposition since Tony Blair\u2019s historic win in 1997. Addressing the nation before entering 10 Downing Street Friday afternoon, Starmer pledged a return to the politics of public service, vowing to heal the \u201cweariness at the heart of the nation\u201d with \u201caction not words.\u201d It was clear going into this election campaign that Britain was screaming out for change after 14 years of Conservative rule that saw cuts in public spending, stretched public services, the chaos of Brexit, a cost-of-living crisis and a sitting prime minister fined by police while in office for the first time in history. Starmer, who had led the opinion polls since October 2021, has promised to be the agent of change that Britain wants. During the campaign, he pledged to grow the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0economy by reforming planning laws and investing in a new industrial strategy. He\u00a0said he\u00a0will set up a national wealth fund with \u00a37.3 billion\u00a0($9.3bn)\u00a0of public money that will help pay for the\u00a0transition to net zero\u00a0emissions. An\u00a0\u00a38.3 billion ($10.5 billion) publicly owned energy company, Great British Energy, will see the\u00a0United Kingdom\u2019s energy grid\u00a0decarbonized\u00a0by 2030. Starmer says all this can be achieved without raising income taxes, though there are no commitments\u00a0on other levies, such as capital gains tax, which is paid on money made from selling assets, including property and shares. The rest of the\u00a0Labour\u00a0manifesto comprised a mix of modest centrism with soft socialism.\u00a0It included imposing\u00a0taxes on private schools to\u00a0help\u00a0pay for state education\u00a0and windfall\u00a0levies\u00a0on energy companies to fund the transition to clean energy. There were\u00a0also\u00a0commitments on workers\u2019 rights, cutting waiting lists for health care\u00a0and\u00a0also controlling immigration. Critics on the right say that Starmer will need to raise taxes to fund his plans, while\u00a0skeptics\u00a0on the left say his manifesto is not bold or ambitious enough to change Britain for the better. In short,\u00a0this is\u00a0a long list of things to sort out in a five-year term when public finances are in disarray. The question for Starmer\u00a0now\u00a0is whether the mess is too big for him to fix and whether he has the political skill to bring about the change he promised. Who is Keir Starmer? On paper,\u00a0the 61-year-old\u00a0Starmer looks like a classic establishment figure. Once a leading human rights lawyer, he became Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 2008, running the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales \u2013\u00a0a high-profile job for which he was knighted, making him the first ever Labour leader to enter the job with the prefix Sir to their name. Starmer, however, is - by the standards of modern political leaders - from relatively humble beginnings. Born in 1962, Starmer grew up in a small town to the south of London. His father was a toolmaker who worked in a factory, his mother was a nurse who suffered with severe physical disabilities, which ultimately led to one of her legs being amputated. While Starmer has never claimed to have suffered poverty, he has talked of financial struggles that affected his family, as well as the learning difficulties that held back his younger brother. Clearly, these early experiences shaped Starmer\u2019s politics. He has talked about noticing people looking down on his father for working in a factory or bullying his brother. His parents were political, naming their\u00a0eldest after the first Labour leader in parliament, Keir Hardie. \u201cHe\u2019s the first Labour leader in a generation to talk about class and snobbery,\u201d\u00a0Tom Baldwin, author of \u201cKeir Starmer: The Biography,\u201d\u00a0told CNN.\u00a0\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make him a class warrior but someone who understands the different layers of pride, aspiration and guilt\u2026 He feels the sting of the disrespect his dad experienced\u2026 He talks a lot about his sister who has led a precarious life as a carer, having not gone to university.\u201d Starmer chose to study law at the University of Leeds, before completing a postgraduate\u00a0degree\u00a0at the University of Oxford. He initially thought he would have a legal career working for trade unions, but as his politics evolved in line with his studies, he became increasingly interested in human rights. What does he believe? Starmer has been on something of a journey since entering politics. He was elected to Parliament in 2015 at the age of 52 and\u00a0entered\u00a0the shadow cabinet\u00a0a\u00a0little over a year later. Corbyn,\u00a0then the Labour leader, made Starmer his Brexit chief following the 2016 referendum. Corbyn is a controversial figure in British politics and serving in his top team is still something that haunts Starmer. Corbyn had historically been\u00a0on\u00a0the far left of the Labour Party. Prior to becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn had at various points in his long career supported nuclear disarmament,\u00a0and\u00a0withdrawal from NATO, and said it was a \u201ctragedy\u201d that Osama bin Laden was killed rather than put on trial. Starmer was in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet\u00a0for\u00a0the 2017 and 2019 general elections \u2013 something the Conservatives bring up regularly as evidence that he is a threat to national security, having tried twice to make Corbyn prime minister. However, Starmer has since kicked Corbyn out of\u00a0the\u00a0Labour Party following an investigation into\u00a0antisemitism\u00a0during Corbyn\u2019s time as leader. Starmer\u00a0has also said\u00a0that he supported Corbyn knowing he would lose. Pressed on that point in a BBC \u201cQuestion Time\u201d program, he said Corbyn \u201cwould be a better prime minister\u201d than \u201cwhat we got\u201d in\u00a0Boris Johnson. Starmer also argues\u00a0that he\u00a0has brought Labour back to a position of electability. This result proves that he was right, but critics of Starmer on the left say that he used Corbyn and\u00a0his wing\u00a0of the Labour Party to win the party leadership in 2020 \u2013 committing to\u00a0several\u00a0left-wing positions\u00a0such as\u00a0nationalizing public services, scrapping university tuition fees and reversing\u00a0Conservative welfare reforms \u2013 only to abandon those pledges\u00a0once he got closer to\u00a0power. James Schneider, Corbyn\u2019s former communications chief, told CNN: \u201cStarmer is not a principled man. His campaign to become Labour leader was systemically dishonest. His cynicism and lack of policies to improve people\u2019s lives will lead to a deep disillusionment that could either feed the hard right or a future people\u2019s movement for change.\u201d Starmer has at various times responded to accusations that he has drifted politically by saying that he puts his country before his political party, and that it\u2019s only possible to change things if you are in power. Can Starmer change Britain? Whether you think Starmer\u2019s\u00a0current\u00a0plan is unambitious, dishonest, or exactly what Britain needs, it\u2019s impossible to push through policy without political and personal capital. Dominic Grieve, a Conservative politician who served as\u00a0attorney\u00a0general while Starmer was DPP, speaks glowingly of this period. \u201cHe ran his department very efficiently and effectively at a really difficult time because his budget had been cut. It was genuinely very impressive,\u201d\u00a0Grieve told CNN. Grieve\u00a0added\u00a0that Starmer was able to be an effective manager because \u201che is not bogged down with years of political ideology or baggage. He can see what is wrong and can address it.\u201d Much as Starmer\u2019s allies might see this as a strength, his opponents, from both sides of politics,\u00a0see it as a weakness. To those on the right, Starmer is a man who would say anything to get in power. He is someone who\u00a0supported\u00a0Corbyn \u2013\u00a0who is anti-NATO and has repeatedly been accused of being a terrorist\u00a0sympathizer \u2013\u00a0to get what he wants and is a danger to Britain. To the left, he is someone who doesn\u2019t have the conviction\u00a0to make radical changes\u00a0and, once in office,\u00a0will not be materially that different to a Conservative leader.

An\u00a0inability to turn that parliamentary power into tangible results\u00a0at a time when voters are crying out for something different\u00a0could mean that five years from now, his moderate, safety-first center-left program may ultimately be\u00a0seen as\u00a0just as big a political gamble as any of those the Conservatives took in the\u00a0past 14 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/europe/keir-starmer-labour-prime-minister-profile-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_americas_argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam", "text": "It was an attack that sent shockwaves through a country long considered a pioneer in LGBTQ rights. In the early hours of May 6, four lesbian women were set on fire\u00a0in Argentina. Only one of them survived. It happened at a\u00a0boarding house\u00a0in the Barracas neighborhood of Buenos Aires, where Pamela Fabiana Cobas, Mercedes Roxana Figueroa, Andrea Amarante and Sof\u00eda Castro Riglo were sharing a room. Witnesses say a man\u00a0broke in\u00a0and threw an incendiary device that set the women on fire. Pamela died soon after. Her partner Roxana died days later of organ failure. Andrea died on May 12 in a hospital. Andrea\u2019s\u00a0partner Sof\u00eda was the sole survivor. She spent weeks recovering in hospital and is alive today only because Andrea threw herself on top of her to shield her from the flames, Sofia\u2019s attorney Gabriela Conder told CNN. \u201cHer partner saved her,\u201d Conder said. Local LGBTQ rights advocates condemned the attack as a hate crime and lesbicide, saying the women were targeted because of their sexual identity. Police have arrested a 62-year-old man who\u00a0lived in the building but, according to Conder, aren\u2019t currently treating the incident as a hate crime as they say the motive is still unclear. For Argentina\u2019s LGBTQ groups \u2013 many of whom are planning to commemorate the four women with a rally this weekend \u2013 the attack represents an extreme manifestation of what they consider a growing wave of hostility against them. Those they blame most for this rising intolerance are the people in power. Chief among them, they say, is the country\u2019s new far-right leader Javier Milei. \u201cThings changed with the new government of Javier Milei,\u201d said Maria Rachid, head of the Institute Against Discrimination of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in Buenos Aires, and a board member and founder of the Argentine LGBT Federation (FALGBT). \u201cSince the beginning of the new government, there are national government officials expressing themselves in a discriminatory manner and those hate speeches before our communities from places with so much power, of course, what they do is generate \u2013 actually legitimize \u2013 and endorse these discriminatory positions that are then expressed with violence and discrimination in everyday life,\u201d Rachid said. Milei under fire When Milei ran for president\u00a0in 2023, he and his party\u00a0were accused of making offensive remarks against LGBTQ communities which were deemed hate speech by multiple groups, including Argentina\u2019s National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes. In a YouTube interview ahead of the November election, Milei insisted that he does\u00a0not oppose same-sex marriage, but in that same interview, he went on to compare homosexuality to having sex with animals. \u201cWhat do I care what your sexual preference is? If you want to be with an elephant, and you have the consent of that elephant, that\u2019s a problem between you and the elephant,\u201d he said, angering LGBTQ communities, who called the comments dehumanizing. In late October, then-congresswoman-elect Diana Mondino, who would later become Milei\u2019s foreign minister, told an interviewer that she supports marriage equality in theory, but at the same time,\u00a0compared it to having lice. \u201cAs a\u00a0liberal, I\u2019m in favor of each person\u2019s life project. It is much broader than marriage equality. Let me exaggerate: If you prefer not to bathe and be full of lice and it is your choice, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t complain later if there is someone who doesn\u2019t like that you have lice,\u201d she said. After\u00a0taking office in December, Milei took steps that\u00a0critics say weakened protections for LGBTQ groups. He banned\u00a0the use of\u00a0gender-inclusive language\u00a0in government; replaced the\u00a0Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity\u00a0with a less powerful undersecretariat within the Ministry of Human Capital; and effectively closed the national anti-discrimination agency, saying the Ministry of Justice would\u00a0absorb its functions. Milei\u2019s administration argued that some of those moves were part of his plan to cut public spending in response to the country\u2019s economic hardships. But critics say his actions have normalized a culture of discrimination toward LGBTQ groups, and in the most extreme cases, have led to violent attacks such as the deadly May 6 arson. \u201cWhen hate speech is enabled by those in power, these sectors start to feel legitimized to attack,\u201d Esteban Paul\u00f3n, a former FALGBT president who was elected to Congress last year, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cAnd obviously, behind the verbal attacks come physical attacks.\u201d \u201c(Attacks) always happened. That\u2019s the reality. But they increased more in this current government due to the hate speeches constantly maintained on television, including hate speeches that our president Javier Milei exerts,\u201d said Jesi Hern\u00e1ndez, a lesbian and communication member of Lesbianxs Autoconvocadxs por la masacre de Barracas (Self-convened Lesbians for the Barracas massacre). \u201cToday it was Pamela, Roxana, Andrea and Sof\u00eda. And tomorrow it can be me.\u201d CNN\u00a0has repeatedly reached out to the presidency for comment on these allegations but has not received a response. Rise in hate crimes In 2023, an annual report by the National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes recorded\u00a0133 crimes\u00a0in which the victims\u2019 sexual orientation, identity and/or gender expression were used as a pretext for the attacks. Those numbers rose from 2022 and 2021, when 129 and 120 crimes were recorded, respectively. Rachid points out that the observatory\u2019s numbers only represent attacks that have been officially recorded, and that the real figures are likely much higher. Hern\u00e1ndez, meanwhile, notes that daily life for many people has been impacted in ways not shown by statistics alone. Some now fear they could be targeted next. \u201cThe\u00a0truth is that now, sleeping peacefully in your bed is a privilege,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said, referencing the May 6 attack, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know if you have a neighbor who will throw something at you or come in. Sleeping is now a privilege for us.\u201d Despite calls from LGBTQ activists, the arson is currently being investigated as an aggravated homicide rather than a hate crime, according to Conder, Sofia\u2019s attorney. Sofia is set to testify at the end of the month, Conder\u00a0said. CNN has reached out to the criminal court investigating the case but has not received a response. Shortly after the May 6 killings, the presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni condemned the attack but\u00a0dismissed\u00a0the notion that it was motivated by hatred toward the sexual orientation of the victims. \u201cI don\u2019t like to define it as an attack on a certain group,\u201d Adorni said at a press conference. \u201cThere are many women and men who are suffering violence and these are things that cannot continue to happen.\u201d Progressives condemned his remarks, insisting that the government should regard lesbicide as a hate crime. Adorni responded on social media with a picture of a Spanish dictionary that said\u00a0lesbicide\u00a0is not a registered word. Progress in Argentina Argentina was once a progressive pioneer in\u00a0Latin America. In 2010, it became the first country in the region to\u00a0legalize same-sex marriage. In 2021, it also became the first to allow nonbinary people to mark their gender as \u201cX\u201d on\u00a0national identity documents. LGBTQ activists fear these historic gains are now being undermined \u2013 and potentially threatened \u2013 by the current government.\u00a0But they also take comfort in surveys that suggest anti-LGBTQ views are the minority in Argentina. According to a public opinion survey conducted in May by the University of San Andr\u00e9s, some 72% of respondents said they are in favor of marriage equality, 70% said they support policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, 75% said they do not consider that transsexuality is a disease that should be treated medically, and 79% said that comprehensive sexuality education in schools is a positive thing. The recent attacks have galvanized activists to fight for new policies and actions that would further protect LGBTQ rights. Congressman Paul\u00f3n told CNN that lawmakers are working with rights groups on various laws that would, among other things, punish discriminatory acts, prevent harassment in schools, and ban efforts to try to \u201ccorrect\u201d people\u2019s sexual orientation, identity and gender. He also said that to reduce attacks on LGBTQ communities, their voices and demands should be amplified in more societal sectors. To that end, Hern\u00e1ndez encouraged LGBTQ groups to push back against hate speech, telling those communities: \u201cThey are not insane, they are not sick, they are not people with lice. Quite the opposite. I would tell them that they are a disruptive person, that they are breaking out of the molds of \u2018normality.\u2019 And that they are very brave \u2026 and that they are whatever they want to be, despite all this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/americas/argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

It said that under the memorandum of understanding the US would also support Panama with \u201cequipment, transportation and logistics\u201d regarding foreigners found \u201cin violation of the immigration laws of Panama.\u201d Panama agreed to \u201ccomply with all international agreements and conventions on the rights of immigrants and those in refugee status,\u201d it added. Panama is home to the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, that has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. News of the agreement comes after Panama\u2019s new President Jose Raul Mulino vowed on Monday that the Central American nation would no longer be a country of transit for migrants. \u201cI will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony. \u201cPanama will no longer be a transit country for illegals,\u201d he said amid cheers from those present. \u201cThe numbers of illegal immigrants passing through the Dari\u00e9n are shocking,\u201d Mulino said, adding that he intends to \u201cappeal to international solidarity regarding the cause that generates the problem and will seek solutions with the countries involved, especially with the United States, which is the final destination of such immigrants.\u201d Mulino said that he\u2019s seen first-hand \u201cthe magnitude of the problem and the dimension of the humanitarian and environmental crisis\u201d that migration causes to the Dari\u00e9n Gap. \u201cThe Dari\u00e9n must continue to be a great green lung, not only for us but for the entire region. We must defend it and take care of it. Its biodiversity cannot be put at risk by illicit activities.\u201d Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to Panama\u2019s National Migration Service. According to migration service figures, a record 520,000 people crossed the jungle last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/americas/panama-us-darien-migrants-agreement-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_weather_west-coast-heat-wave-california-nevada-oregon", "text": "Hundreds of new temperature records could be broken into next week as sweltering heat drags on across the country, impacting millions of Americans in the Western and Eastern US. Nearly 70 million people are under heat alerts Sunday, after over three dozen high-temperature records were either set or tied on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. Highs in the upper 90s to 110s are expected up and down the West Coast and parts of the Great Basin. \u201cIn the West, intense widespread dangerous heat will continue through early next week,\u201d the weather service said. \u201cAll-time heat records may be possible in a few locations.\u201d By Wednesday, over 250 warm high and low temperature records could be set. And nearly 40 million people in the contiguous US are forecast to see temperatures over 100 degrees over the next seven days. A slew of daily temperature records were broken this Fourth of July weekend. On Saturday, Death Valley reached 128 degrees, breaking the daily record of 127 set on July 6, 2007. Las Vegas reached 115 degrees, tying with records in 2007 and 1989. Kingman, Arizona, reached 109 degrees, breaking the previous record of 108. On Sunday, temperatures in Las Vegas hit 120 degrees for the first time in recorded history, according to preliminary data from the weather service.\u00a0In more than 32,000 days of records, the temperature had never climbed above 117 degrees prior to Sunday. The city\u2019s heat is not just a record for its peak temperature, but also for its longevity. Las Vegas temperatures have exceeded 110 degrees each day since July 3 and are forecast to do so every day until at least next Sunday. That will mark a stretch of prolonged extreme heat longer than any ever experienced in the city, with 11 days or more above 110 degrees. In California, Daggett broke its daily temperature record, reaching 117 degrees. Bishop reached 108 degrees, setting another record for the state. Several record highs were also set in the Sacramento area, including in Redding, where it reached 119 degrees and beat the all-time high temperature record of 118, according to the weather service in Sacramento. Extremely dangerous heat is expected to persist in the West, with excessive heat watches, warnings and heat advisories in effect for much of the region. Heat warnings are active in California and Nevada due to the increased risk of heat-related illnesses there. \u201cIntense, widespread, and long duration heat building in the West will be extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if not taken seriously,\u201d the weather service said. An excessive heat warning is in effect until late Wednesday evening for Death Valley, California, where temperatures are expected to be between 122 to 129 degrees. Elsewhere in the state, Owens Valley could reach 111 degrees, and Barstow could reach 118. In Nevada, Las Vegas and Pahrump could also reach 118 degrees. \u201cHot temperatures overnight will mean little relief from the daytime heat, especially in Las Vegas and Death Valley, where low temperatures may not fall below 90 degrees for several days,\u201d the National Weather Service said. Death Valley \u2013 the driest national park in the US \u2013 could hit a sizzling 130 degrees by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Las Vegas. For people without adequate cooling and hydration, the multi-day nature of the heat and record warm overnight temperatures could cause heat stress to build. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0weather service. Oregon and Washington have both also seen record heat and temperatures are expected to remain in the triple digits through early next week. \u201cLook for more records to fall in the coming days as temperatures in the inland valleys are likely to climb near or above 100 degrees each day through Tuesday, July 9,\u201d the weather service in Portland said. Meanwhile, heat and humidity in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is forecast to gradually subside into next week, lingering longest along the Gulf Coast and into the Carolinas, the weather service said. Heat index values approaching 110 degrees on Saturday in the mid-Atlantic region will be lowered to near 100 degrees on Sunday. Heat advisories currently stretch from upstate New York down the East Coast to Alabama. In the West, the heat wave is expected to expand into the Great Basin and eventually the northern High Plains into next week. It\u2019s likely to remain into mid-July, according to the weather service. Wildfire threat is fueled by unrelenting heat Intense heat, paired with dry windy conditions, is bringing a critical risk of wildfires to parts of the upper Great Basin toward the Four Corners for the rest of the weekend. Portions of southern Idaho and southern Utah are particularly at risk. Sweltering heat on the West Coast could continue to fuel large wildfires in California. More than 3,000 wildfires across the state have burned over 150,000 acres so far in 2024, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.   Cal Fire spokesperson Nick Schuler says triple-digit temperatures and critical fire weather conditions have proven to be a challenge for\u00a0the more than 3,500\u00a0firefighters battling fires across the state. \u201cChallenges are immense. We\u2019re dealing with the increased temperatures, very steep and remote terrain,\u201d Schuler told CNN\u2019s Fredricka Whitfield, adding \u201cthe ability for rapid growth from the amount of vegetation that\u2019s across the state is a challenge.\u201d The Basin Fire, which is the largest active wildfire in the state, burned over 14,000 acres in Fresno County and was 60% contained Saturday evening, according to the Cal Fire. Another large wildfire, the Lake Fire, ignited Friday afternoon in Santa Barbara County and has already scorched over 13,200 acres. The Santa Barbara Sheriff\u2019s Office issued evacuation warnings in nearby areas and several roads were closed. The Thompson Fire, for which California Gov. Gavin Newsom had issued an emergency declaration, was 79% contained as of Saturday night. After starting Tuesday, it has burned through nearly 4,000 acres in Butte County. Two firefighters were injured, 26 structures were destroyed and eight were damaged by the fire, according to Cal Fire. \u201cDangerously hot and dry conditions were observed across the incident,\u201d according to Cal Fire. The French Fire in Mariposa County was 35% contained and had burned through over 900 acres after it started on the fourth of July. Due to the fire, evacuation orders and warnings were issued, four firefighters were injured and four structures were destroyed, according to Cal Fire. Meanwhile, the Mccain Fire in San Diego County had burned about 1,500 acres and was 95% contained. \u201cWe are happy to report that we are seeing an increase in the percentage of containment,\u201d Schuler said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to lift some of the evacuation orders and warnings allowing people to start to cautiously make way back to their homes.\u201d But\u00a0crews still have to contend with\u00a0several\u00a0days\u00a0ahead\u00a0of\u00a0continued\u00a0heat, Schuler said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/weather/west-coast-heat-wave-california-nevada-oregon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_france-le-pen-ukraine-mbappe-intl-cmd", "text": "As Ukraine bleeds territory to Russia, support from one of Kyiv\u2019s strongest backers looks set to falter if the far right sweep to power in Sunday\u2019s French parliamentary elections. Marine\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen,\u00a0figurehead of the French far-right National Rally (RN) party, vowed a prime minister from her party would prevent Kyiv using French-supplied long-range weapons to strike inside Russia and would stymie French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s suggestion\u00a0he might\u00a0put French boots on Ukrainian soil. \u201cIf Emmanuel Macron wants to send troops to Ukraine and the prime minister is against it, then there are no troops sent to Ukraine,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThe prime minister has the final say.\u201d Marine\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0gave a wide-ranging interview to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour on Thursday ahead of the second-round vote in France\u2019s snap\u00a0parliamentary election, called\u00a0by Macron\u00a0after\u00a0National Rally\u2019s stunning European election results in May. She tore into the national soccer side\u2019s star striker,\u00a0Kylian Mbapp\u00e9,\u00a0refused to\u00a0commit to\u00a0immediately throwing\u00a0out racist candidates in her party and signalled a\u00a0stark\u00a0shift\u00a0in\u00a0France\u2019s level of\u00a0support for Ukraine, if elected. Presenting\u00a0herself firmly as\u00a0in the French political mainstream,\u00a0three-time unsuccessful presidential candidate Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0struck a confident, combative figure, days away from perhaps the greatest political victory of her career. With polls pointing towards the National Rally holding the biggest share of\u00a0the 577\u00a0seats in the National Assembly come\u00a0Monday morning,\u00a0although potentially not achieving\u00a0an\u00a0absolute majority,\u00a0Macron will likely offer them the chance to choose the country\u2019s next prime minister.\u00a0Le Pen\u2019s youthful disciple and party leader Jordan Bardella has previously said he will only accept the premiership if National Rally wins by a large enough margin. Even without an RN prime minister, any legislative action in the French parliament will have to navigate around a far-right center of gravity. If there is an RN\u00a0premiership, it would\u00a0set up a tense \u201ccohabitation\u201d with Macron\u2019s centrist presidency, especially over centerpiece policies like French support for Ukraine\u2019s war against Russia. Beyond\u00a0blocking\u00a0potential\u00a0troop deployments to Ukraine \u2013 mooted by Macron\u00a0as a way to boost\u00a0military\u00a0instructors\u2019 efficiency \u2013\u00a0Le Pen\u00a0told CNN that Kyiv\u2019s permission to use French-supplied long-range missiles inside Russia would also be rescinded. Macron was one of the first\u00a0leaders publicly to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with Western weapons, setting the stage for Washington to do the same. This has allowed\u00a0Kyiv\u00a0to target Russian military bases, formations and artillery\u00a0used to launch attacks\u00a0into Ukraine. Aside from troop deployments, Le Pen said her only \u201cred line\u201d on Ukraine was stopping France becoming a \u201cco-belligerent\u201d in the conflict via the use of long-range French missiles against targets on Russian soil. Most Western leaders currently do not consider that such supplies constitute co-belligerence with Ukraine. Le Pen: Mbapp\u00e9\u00a0not representative Le Pen directed\u00a0most of her ire closer to home. Speaking from her party\u2019s seat in Paris,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0lashed out at French soccer star\u00a0Mbapp\u00e9,\u00a0who has made\u00a0repeated comments in recent weeks seemingly haranguing the far right. Undoubtedly the brightest star of French football today, he joined a host of celebrities\u00a0this week\u00a0in calling on voters\u00a0to mobilize\u00a0to keep the far-right from power. \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency. We can\u2019t\u00a0leave our country in the hands of these people,\u201d\u00a0Mbapp\u00e9\u00a0said\u00a0Thursday, following National Rally\u2019s strong first-round showing. \u201cIt\u2019s really urgent. I think that we\u2019ve seen the results, it\u2019s catastrophic.\u201d Speaking last month, earlier\u00a0in the Euros\u00a02024 soccer tournament in Germany, the striker,\u00a0whose family originally come from Algeria and Cameroon, stressed that he didn\u2019t want to \u201crepresent\u00a0a country\u201d that\u00a0didn\u2019t embody his \u201cvalues.\u201d Le Pen rejected his comments, dismissing him as unrepresentative. \u201cFrench people are fed up of being\u00a0lectured and advised on how to vote,\u201d\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0told CNN. \u201cMbapp\u00e9\u00a0doesn\u2019t represent French people with an immigration background, because there are far more of them living on the minimum wage, who can\u2019t afford housing and can\u2019t afford heating, than people like Mr. Mbapp\u00e9,\u201d she said. Accusations of racism If National Rally wins big enough\u00a0in Sunday\u2019s election,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0can expect to\u00a0see her loyal lieutenant\u00a0Bardella installed as France\u2019s prime minister. She will have unquestionably succeeded in bringing her party into the political mainstream. Having won nearly a third of French votes cast in the European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0elections\u00a0in May,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0refused to be labelled as a \u201cfar-right\u201d politician, which she said carries a stigma. \u201cIt does not correspond to what we are. And not at all to what the far right is in the United States,\u201d she\u00a0claimed. Le\u00a0Pen\u2019s party currently supports ending the automatic right to citizenship for people born to foreign parents in France\u00a0and\u00a0severely restricting citizenship by naturalization.\u00a0Additionally, the party proposes restricting the rights of foreigners to access some social services, including housing, with preferential access given to French nationals. The\u00a0second\u00a0pledge\u00a0listed in National Rally\u2019s manifesto\u00a0is a law targeting Islamist ideologies, although it does not elaborate on how. Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0fended off accusations of racism\u00a0made\u00a0against some of the hundreds of candidates her party fielded for the election. \u201cI think that in any political movement, there can be what we call \u2018black sheep,\u2019\u201d she said. One candidate, Florent de Kersauson,\u00a0reposted\u00a0a promotional picture showing a mixed-race child as \u201cfalse Brittany,\u201d another, Daniel Grenon, reportedly said North Africans have no place in \u201chigh places\u201d in France during a recorded local debate, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Grenon has claimed this was an \u201cerroneous\u201d quotation. \u201cI\u2019m not contesting the existence of these comments,\u201d\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0said, referring to the accusations\u00a0levelled against her candidates.

Ties with Russia Cohabiting with the staunchly pro-European Emmanuel Macron will have its complications for the keenly anti-Brussels National Rally. Top of the list of sensitivities is likely to be foreign policy, where\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0and Macron rarely see eye to eye. A far-right government\u00a0would\u00a0be welcome news for Russian President Vladimir Putin though. Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0has landed in hot water in the past over Russia. She\u2019s boasted of her admiration for Putin, refused to condemn Putin\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea\u00a0in 2014\ufeff, and even took out a\u00a0huge loan from a Russian bank. Many held similar suspicions ahead of the election of\u00a0hard-right\u00a0culture warrior Italian Prime Minister\u00a0Giorgia\u00a0Meloni\u00a0in 2022.\u00a0But in office, she\u2019s proved a team player in Europe\u2019s support for Kyiv. There\u2019s no such absolution\u00a0yet\u00a0for\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0though. On Wednesday, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry posted a\u00a0picture of\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0on X, stating that French voters are seeking \u201ca break from the dictate of Washington and Brussels.\u201d Pressed on the post\u2019s relevance,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u2019s answer may point to her following Meloni\u2019s hard shoulder to Moscow. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of interference, and in that sense, I find it unacceptable,\u201d\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0said of the post. She\u2019s broken many molds already in her time in politics; the weight of real political power for National Rally may change her further still.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/france-le-pen-ukraine-mbappe-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_middleeast_destruction-inside-rafa-gaza-israel-intl", "text": "Thick clouds of dirt and sand fill the air as our convoy of Humvees arrives in Rafah, the first time international reporters have been allowed in since the Israeli military launched its\u00a0ground\u00a0assault on this city two months ago. As the dust settles, the scale of destruction is startling. But it is also all-too familiar. This part of\u00a0Rafah,\u00a0Gaza\u2019s southernmost city which became the\u00a0last refuge for more than a million Palestinians\u00a0earlier in the war,\u00a0is\u00a0now unrecognizable. Israel has repeatedly described its ground operation in Rafah as \u201climited.\u201d But in this neighborhood in southern Rafah, the destruction looks almost identical to what I\u2019ve seen in northern Gaza, in central Gaza and in Khan Younis through the limited prism of trips into Gaza with the Israeli military. Some homes are\u00a0flattened and\u00a0other\u00a0buildings bombed out. \u201cThis is where the main destruction is because it was booby-trapped and because the tunnels were booby trapped,\u201d Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF\u2019s top spokesman, tells me when I press him on how this represents a \u201climited\u201d operation. \u201cAnd\u00a0when you see destruction, it\u2019s because either the houses were booby trapped, either when we demolished a tunnel the houses\u00a0fell apart, or that Hamas fired from those houses and risked our forces and we had no other method but to make sure that our forces were safe,\u201d\u00a0Hagari added. Other parts of Rafah are not nearly as devastated, he says. But CNN cannot independently verify his claims: Israel has barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza independently and our only access is via embeds with the Israeli military. And this devastated section of Rafah is where they have brought us. The Israeli military has brought us here not to see the destruction, but to talk about why they launched an offensive here in the first place,\u00a0what they\u00a0say they\u2019ve uncovered\u00a0and what they\u2019ve accomplished. Before arriving into Rafah, we drive along Gaza-Egypt border:\u00a0through\u00a0what\u2019s known as the Philadelphi corridor.\u00a0The area\u00a0was seized by the\u00a0Israeli military, which\u00a0says it has uncovered dozens of tunnel shafts as well as rocket launchers used to fire rockets into Israel. Hagari showed us one tunnel shaft, which he said stretched about 90 feet\u00a0(28\u00a0meters)\u00a0underground. The Israeli military says Hamas has used the Philadelphi corridor to smuggle weapons in from Egypt and then deeper into the rest of the Gaza Strip. Hagari says some of the tunnels stretch toward Egypt, but he cannot yet definitively say whether those tunnels were functional and were used to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Egypt has denied that there are any tunnels stretching into its territory from Gaza. \u201cWe are researching those tunnels carefully and making sure which ones were functional and which are not functional anymore because maybe they were \u2013 from the Egyptian side \u2013 stopped,\u201d Hagari says. He won\u2019t say exactly how long Israeli forces will need to\u00a0occupy\u00a0this corridor, but says it could be weeks or months. Hagari also says Israeli forces killed more than 900 Hamas fighters in Rafah\u00a0and are close to defeating Hamas\u2019s Rafah brigade. But how many militants have melted away and are likely to regroup once Israeli forces leave this area is less clear \u2013 and absent a long-term strategy or an alternative to Hamas governance in Gaza, Hamas has already begun to do just that in other areas where Israeli forces had previously withdrawn. As for the Rafah ground operation, Hagari cannot say whether it will be the last\u00a0in Gaza. \u201cI won\u2019t say that because what you will see is when we\u2019ll have intelligence that maybe there are hostages in one of the points in Gaza, we will operate and do a raid. If we\u2019ll get intelligence in one of those areas that Hamas terrorists are preparing a terror attack against Israelis or our forces, we will do a raid and attack,\u201d Hagari says. \u201cThis is what you\u2019ll see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/middleeast/destruction-inside-rafa-gaza-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_canada-dream-supersonic-bomber-avro-arrow", "text": "It was meant to be one of the most advanced aircraft of its era, dispatching the threat of Soviet nuclear bombers and making Canada a world leader in military aviation and engineering. The Avro Arrow, also known as the CF-105, had a lot resting on its wings. However, the dream turned into a nightmare when the program was canceled less than a year after the plane\u2019s first flight, and well before it entered into service. To this day, 65 years later, the Avro Arrow remains one of Canada\u2019s biggest collective regrets and still fuels public discourse, as recently unveiled documents have shed some light on exactly what happened to the doomed project. \u201cThis aircraft was completely Canadian,\u201d says Richard Mayne, chief historian of the Royal Canadian Air Force, \u201cand the performance markers during its development very much showed that it was at least on par with the most advanced designs of the time.\u201d \u201cWhen it got canceled, that was one of Canada\u2019s \u2019what if\u2019 moments,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe Arrow has still got a grip on our national psyche.\u201d Cold War threat The Avro Arrow was a direct response to the perceived threat from the Soviet Union, following the end of World War II, of bombers capable of flying over the Arctic and reaching North America with a nuclear payload. \u201cThe Royal Canadian Air Force put out a requirement in 1952 for an interceptor capable of Mach 2 speed and an altitude of 50,000 feet,\u201d Mayne tells CNN. \u201cThey needed something fast that had the range and the altitude to intercept these Soviet bombers as far north as possible, before they reached Canada.\u201d Aircraft manufacturer Avro Canada had just successfully put into service the CF-100 Canuck, a versatile twinjet fighter designed and built in Canada, and was tasked with developing a vastly more advanced version of it. It was an ambitious plan that came at a significant moment for Canada. \u201cThe country had emerged from the Second World War as a major player,\u201d says Mayne. \u201cWe had the third largest navy in the world, the fourth largest air force. But Canadian citizenship didn\u2019t actually exist until 1947 \u2013 Canada had just come of age.\u201d Development started in 1955, and in record time the first Arrow was rolled out to the public, on October 4, 1957 \u2013 the same day as the launch of the Sputnik I, the world\u2019s first artificial satellite, which marked the start of the space age. \u201cIt was a coincidence,\u201d says Mayne, \u201cbut a horrible one, because Sputnik demonstrated that you could put a nuclear payload on the rocket that sent it into orbit. And the Arrow wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u201d Dead on arrival Designed for a crew of two and sporting a \u201cdelta\u201d wing design and a white livery that gave it an elegant look, the Arrow was just under 78 feet long with a wingspan of 50 feet, making it comparatively larger than both its predecessor, the CF-100 Canuck, and the Phantom F4, a dominant American fighter plane that would enter service in 1961. It first flew on March 25, 1958, but by that time, Mayne says, strategic thinkers, senior military personnel and politicians already believed the world had entered a \u201cpush button\u201d warfare scenario, where the nuclear threat was restricted to long-range missiles, with interceptors and bombers no longer playing a dominant role. \u201cThat turned out to be false, because the bomber threat continued and it continues to this day, but that was the thinking at the time,\u201d says Mayne. The plane had lost relevance, and the ballooning costs of the project and the changing political climate did the rest. On February 29, 1959, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker canceled the program, and within weeks the five planes that had been built, along with most of the assembly line, were destroyed for fear that they could be the subject of Soviet espionage. As a result, thousands of jobs were lost and Avro Canada eventually collapsed entirely. \u201cIf the United Kingdom had bought some Arrows, that actually might have saved the program,\u201d says Mayne. \u201cBut with no foreign contracts, our country was too small to support such an advanced technology. We were shooting for the stars, which is ironic because a lot of Avro engineers later went down to NASA and helped with the Apollo program.\u201d A life of its own Rumors and myths immediately began to swirl around the reasons for the abrupt cancellation of the program, some of which persist to this day. \u201cThe aircraft has taken on almost a mythological standing in Canada,\u201d says Alan Barnes, a senior fellow at Ottawa\u2019s Carleton University who has looked at the role played by intelligence in the decision to stop the plane\u2019s development. One set of myths, according to Barnes, essentially blames the United States for misleading Canada on the shifting Soviet threat, supposedly because they didn\u2019t want Canada to produce an aircraft that would have been better than American ones. Another says Canadian intelligence analysts deliberately misconstrued information to support a decision that the government had essentially made, providing an excuse for it. \u201cBut all of this was speculation, as nobody had actually seen the intelligence reports,\u201d he says. But in 2023, Barnes published a paper on those reports, after retrieving archival documents that show a clear link between the intelligence and how it was used by those in charge at the time. \u201cAt the beginning, the air force really didn\u2019t pay any attention to intelligence,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cThey decided they wanted a big new fancy plane, so they came up with all the operational requirements largely in isolation, without really paying attention to what the reports were saying.\u201d By the late 1950s, he adds, the Arrow arrow was getting very expensive and quite delayed. \u201cCanadian intelligence produced a very high quality assessment in early 1958, saying the bomber threat was nowhere near as serious as previously thought, and that the Soviets weren\u2019t building up a massive bomber force, and were likely to shift their production and research into missiles,\u201d says Barnes. The policy implication was that if a threat was being reduced, there was very little reason to be spending so much money on an aircraft that wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with the ballistic missiles. \u201cBy the summer of 1958, the Chiefs of Staff Committee had come to the conclusion that they could no longer recommend continuing with the program, but didn\u2019t want to cancel it right then because of the political impact,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cThey sort of delayed things into early 1959, when it was still seen publicly as a disaster for Canadian industry as well as a political scandal. The government did what they needed to do, but it blew up in their face. They lost the election a couple of years later, to a certain extent on these defense issues.\u201d According to Barnes, the aircraft was never as good as people made it out to be. \u201cIt was canceled at just the right time to maintain this kind of mythology,\u201d he says. \u201cIt never flew with any of its armaments and the actual engines that it was designed to use. Everything was potential, so many Canadians can still pretend that this would have been the best aircraft in the world.\u201d Enduring impact In 1997, the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) commissioned a TV miniseries about the plane titled \u201cThe Arrow\u201d starring Dan Aykroyd as Crawford Gordon, president of Avro Canada. A full-size wooden model of the aircraft was built for the production and is currently in the archives of the Reynolds Museum in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. Another model, made of aircraft-grade aluminum, is on display at the Edenvale Airport near Muskoka, Ontario. A third model, about two-thirds the size of a real Arrow, is under construction at Springbank Airport in Calgary \u2013 but this one is meant to actually fly. It\u2019s the passion project of a group of engineers who are hoping to take it to the skies by 2026. Although none of the actual Arrows have survived intact, the original cockpit and nose gear of one of them as well as parts of the wings of another are on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. Perhaps the strongest indication of Canada\u2019s obsession with the Arrow came in 2018, when after a year of searching, sunken Arrow models were recovered from the bottom of Lake Ontario. The models were fired across the lake as part of flight tests in the mid-1950s, and numerous groups had been looking for them before without success. The endeavor was funded out of pocket by John Burzynski, a Canadian mining businessman. \u201cThe significance of finding the models lies in reminding Canadians of the great effort that went into designing, testing, building and flying an advanced technological aircraft, all done in a short six-year timeframe,\u201d Burzynski says, adding that among the pieces discovered was one of the very first test models, substantially intact, which is now on display at the Canadian Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. Speaking of the importance and role of the Arrow in Canadian history, Burzynski says that everything was possible to the generation that followed World War II, and the world was changing quickly. \u201cThe massive effort that went into the Arrow program was essentially a live exercise, showing that anything is possible when enough effort and ingenuity is applied to a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cTo many it seems that this would have been an inflection point for Canada to develop both a vigorous air and possibly even space program, had it not been abruptly canceled.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier headline on this story mischaracterized the Avro Arrow.

{"id": "2024_07_06_middleeast_palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl", "text": "Nearly 2 million people have been displaced in Gaza \u2013 almost the entire population \u2013 after the Israeli military last week ordered a further 80,000 people to evacuate parts of Gaza City amid a renewed ground operation, latest UN figures show. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has stepped up assaults in several parts of the Strip, including the Shujaya neighborhood in the north, where it previously said it had dismantled Hamas. UNRWA, the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees, estimates that up to 1.9 million people in Gaza have been internally displaced \u2013 about 90% of the population of the Strip, estimated by the UN to be around 2.1 million people. The number of displaced people rose from 1.7 million since Israel launched its offensive on the southern city of Rafah in May. The fresh flurry of offensives raises questions about how and when Israel will wind down its war, which has been fought for nearly nine months with the aims of destroying Hamas\u2019 military and governing capacities and rescuing Israeli hostages. Israeli officials had said its incursion into Rafah \u2013 the southernmost point of Gaza to which Hamas was thought to have regrouped after Israel\u2019s destruction of the north \u2013 would be the final stage of its war, but the uptick in fighting in the north suggests Hamas retains an ongoing presence. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Saturday that 80,000 people have been displaced this week after the IDF issued evacuation orders in eastern areas of Gaza City. Renewed offensives In Shujaya, the IDF said Saturday that its combat teams had fought \u201carmed squads\u201d of Hamas militants over the past 24 hours, \u201cdestroying weapons and terrorist infrastructures above and below the ground.\u201d It said its soldiers ambushed a group of Hamas fighters and \u201celiminated all the terrorists without any casualties to our forces,\u201d and that an air strike had wiped out a terrorist squad with rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers. Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense told CNN on Saturday that Israeli bombing in the area has continued \u201cwithout stopping.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Shujaya has been the same for 10 days and our crews cannot enter to save lives there,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, operations have also continued in southern Rafah, where the bulk of Palestinian civilians had initially been displaced. The IDF said it had eliminated a number of \u201cterrorist cells\u201d and underground structures. The IDF did not provide a figure for the number of airstrikes in Gaza over the past 24 hours. The fighting is continuing to take a huge toll on civilians, many of whom have been displaced nine or 10 times already. One man displaced in Khan Younis told CNN about the hours needed to get hold of small amounts of clean water. \u201cLife in tents is very difficult. We live on sand. Clothes get dirty. Hands get dirty. The body needs to be cleaned. Dining utensils need to be cleaned,\u201d Zakaria Bakr, from the Al-Shati camp, told CNN Saturday. He said his children often have to fetch water for the family. \u201cThe children live a life that is not their own and they have never known this suffering before,\u201d he said. On Friday, UNRWA posted a video of people in makeshift tents on a beach in the central city of Nuseirat, saying they were \u201cbuilding sand walls to protect themselves from the incoming tide.\u201d \u201cThere are few safe spaces left for families to move to,\u201d it said. \u201cMany families rely on seawater for washing, cleaning and even drinking.\u201d Elsewhere in Nuseirat, three journalists were killed Saturday in a strike on an apartment building, the Hamas-run government media office told CNN. Since Friday, two other journalists have also been killed in other parts of the Strip, it said. CNN is asking the IDF for comment on the Nuseirat strike. Across the Strip, fuel shortages are threatening work at hospitals, and in distributing the trickle of aid passing into Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for administering the delivery of aid to Gaza, said Friday that the content of 1,150 aid trucks is waiting to be collected on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing.

However, we have counted 51 candidates, deputies, or campaigners who have been physically assaulted. I am not counting verbal aggressions here,\u201d Darmanin told CNN affiliate BFMTV. The attacks have ranged from the less severe to \u201cextremely serious,\u201d Darmanin said, adding that some candidates have been hospitalised for their injuries. Roughly thirty or so people have been taken in for questioning in relation to the attacks, Darmanin added. France has been grappling with high tensions in the run-up to this Sunday\u2019s elections. An additional 30,000 police have been laid on to ensure that neither the far-left nor the far-right succeed in \u201ccreating disorder,\u201d Darmanin said earlier this week. Politicians have\u00a0repeatedly warned that a far-right victory\u00a0could provoke huge protests in the streets, with French President Emmanuel Macron going so far as to say \u201ccivil war\u201d may break out if the extreme left or right wins by a large margin in Sunday\u2019s runoff vote. French government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot and her team came under attack while canvassing on Wednesday night. Meanwhile, National Rally (RN) politician Marie Dauchy, who is running in the southeastern constituency of Savoie, opted to suspend her campaign after she said was physically assaulted while campaigning at a market.

The guns were sold at French auction house Osenat in Fontainebleau, just outside Paris, on Sunday. They were originally valued at an estimated \u20ac1.2 million-\u20ac1.5 million ($1.3 million- $1.63 million). According to the auctioneer, they were given to Napoleon\u2019s friend and squire Armand de Caulaincourt just after the emperor attempted suicide in April 1814. Leading up to this date, Napoleon had fought a series of battles against a coalition of European states formed in response to his invasion of Russia. Despite Napoleon winning a number of these battles, Paris fell to the allied coalition on March 31, 1814. In the days before the suicide attempt, Caulaincourt said, \u201cNapoleon had been talking about how to kill himself for days,\u201d according to Osenat. The emperor \u201chad frequently examined his pistols, removing bullets from his n\u00e9cessaire\u201d during this time, Osenat reports Caulaincourt as saying. Eventually, Osenat says, Napoleon tried to kill himself using poison after signing the Treaty of Fontainebleau. He survived the attempt, abdicated and was exiled to Elba, an island off the Italian coast. The guns were sold in a Burr walnut box with an ebony inlay. The lid of the box is lined with green velvet embroidered with the letter N, which is bordered with embroidered flowers. The box and two guns also bear Napoleon\u2019s cipher. Last November, Osenat sold one of Napoleon\u2019s famous black hats for a record \u20ac1.932 million ($2.1 million). Osenat told CNN Monday that the pistols were declared a National Treasure by the French government a week before they were sold, meaning that they cannot leave France. \u201cThis pair of pistols represents the fall, the end, the abdication\u201d of the French emperor, auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat said in a video posted by the auction house. \u201cNapoleon fell from the pinnacle of power.

{"id": "2024_07_05_asia_japan-us-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The US military will send dozens of its newest fighter jets to Japan as part of a $10 billion upgrade of its forces in the country, the Defense Department announced Wednesday. In a news release, the Pentagon said the effort would be carried out \u201cover the next several years\u201d to \u201cenhance the US-Japan Alliance, bolster regional deterrence, and strengthen peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\u201d The modernization plan will see 48 fifth-generation F-35A fighters replace 36 F-16s at Misawa Air Base in northern Japan, and 36 brand-new F-15EX jets deploy to Kadena Air Base on the southern island of Okinawa, replacing 48 older F-15C/D models that have been pulled from the region in the past year, the Pentagon release said. At Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, just south of Hiroshima on the main island of Honshu, the number of deployed F-35B aircraft will be modified, the Pentagon said, without giving specific numbers. \u201cThe Department\u2019s plan to station the Joint Force\u2019s most advanced tactical aircraft in Japan demonstrates the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan and both countries\u2019 shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\u201d the news release said. Japan said basing the new fighter aircraft in the country would enhance US capabilities there. \u201cIn the face of the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II, and amidst the increased military activities of neighboring countries, the United States is maintaining and strengthening the presence of U.S. forces in Japan to further enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, the government\u2019s top spokesman, said at a regular briefing Thursday. Japan\u2019s alliance with the US has become increasingly important in a region that is seeing China, Russia and North Korea all pose threats that Tokyo seeks to counter. Japan has festering territorial disputes in the north with Russia and with China over islands in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, North Korea\u2019s growing missile program, which has seen Pyongyang send missiles over Japanese territory in recent years, draws condemnation from Tokyo with every projectile test. Japan also keeps a wary eye on the situation surrounding Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that the Chinese Communist Party has vowed to bring under Beijing\u2019s control, by force if necessary. As much as 90% of Japan\u2019s energy supplies come via sea lanes near Taiwan, according to Tokyo, which sees the status quo around the island as key to its security. Okinawa is only about 450 miles (725 kilometers) from Taiwan, and both the US and Japan maintain key air bases on the island. US air power in Japan The US Air Force calls the Kadena Air Base, home of the 18th Wing, its \u201cKeystone of the Pacific,\u201d and for more than four decades the older model F-15s based there were central to US deterrence in the region. But from 2022, as the twin-engine fighters neared the end of their service life, the US Air Force began pulling them from Kadena. While the service has rotated other assets through the air base since, to cover the absence of the older F-15s, the permanent presence of the F-15EXs will bring stability to the force structure. The F-15EX is a leap above the older models. Manufacturer Boeing says the jet has \u201cunparalleled weapons capacity,\u201d with an ability to carry 12 advanced medium-range, air-to-air missiles (AMRAAM) and\u00a0to fire them from a range \u201cfarther than any other fighter in the US Air Force arsenal.\u201d Although not a stealth fighter like the F-35, Boeing says the F-15EX has next-generation survivability. \u201cIt serves as a long-range standoff weapons system that is also capable of penetrating and surviving in highly contested environments,\u201d the company says on its website. Military aviation analyst Peter Layton said the F-15EXs would be a worry for China in the event of any conflict. The jet can be fitted with stealthy long-range cruise missiles with a range of more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) that could strike inside the Chinese mainland, he said. Newer missiles under development could double that distance, he added. \u201cThat will hold at risk even more Chinese mainland military bases and offer a very quick attack option,\u201d Layton said. The F-15EX is the Air Force\u2019s newest fighter jet, with the first operational plane delivered to the Oregon Air National Guard in early June. The F-35As that will be stationed at Misawa Air Base are the Air Force\u2019s newest stealth fighters. They\u2019ve long been designated as the replacement for F-16s in the USAF inventory. F-35s deliver \u201can enhanced capability to survive in the advanced threat environment in which it was designed to operate,\u201d an Air Force fact sheet says. Layton said the F-15EXs and F-35As complement each other well in a combat scenario. \u201cThe F-35 is an excellent low-observable sensor platform that could operate forward in stealth mode relaying data back to patrolling F-15EXs with their supersonic cruise and large air-to-air missile load outs,\u201d said Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. The aircraft deployments add to other improvements Washington has been making to its force structure in Japan, where the US has more than 50,000 troops. Okinawa houses more than 25,000 US military personnel and more than two dozen military installations. Roughly 70% of the US military bases in Japan are on Okinawa. The US and Japan announced last year that a newly redesignated Marine unit with advanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and the ability to fire anti-ship missiles would be based in Japan.

{"id": "2024_07_05_middleeast_pezeshkian-wins-irans-vote-intl-hnk", "text": "Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian has won Iran\u2019s presidential election, the country\u2019s electoral authority said Saturday, defeating his hardline rival in a pivotal vote amid heightened tensions both domestically and internationally. Out of 30.5 million votes counted in Friday\u2019s runoff, Pezeshkian won 53.6%, edging out ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, who had 44.3% of the votes, state-run Press TV reported. Voter turnout was 49.8%, Press TV reported. Pezeshkian was elected in a second round of voting after securing the highest number of ballots in the first round, ahead of Jalili. The first round saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. In a victory speech in Tehran on Saturday, Pezeshkian thanked the Iranian people and vowed to serve as a \u201cvoice of the voiceless.\u201d \u201cI am the servant of the people of Iran. We will serve you, dear people of our country,\u201d Pezeshkian said at the burial site of Imam Khomeini, the leader of Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution and the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The 69-year-old trained heart surgeon and lawmaker acknowledged the challenges facing the country as he called for unity in what he described as a new chapter for Iran. \u201cLet\u2019s come together, let\u2019s stick together, let\u2019s get united and work together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would be able to deal with every aspect and area of the government: economic, financial, military and social challenges.\u201d The country\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, thanked the candidates and congratulated the president-elect. Khamenei praised the country for quickly holding \u201cfree and transparent elections\u201d in the wake of President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s death. A snap election was held after Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May in Iran\u2019s remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials. Khamenei advised Pezeshkian to act \u201cin continuation of the path\u201d of Raisi. The Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, must certify the vote before Pezeshkian can take office. Pezeshkian will take the helm in a country that is facing increasing international isolation, internal discontent, a spiraling economy and the prospect of direct conflict with its archenemy Israel. The lawmaker was the only reformist candidate vying for the top elected seat in the country after dozens of other candidates were barred from running. He has favored dialogue with Iran\u2019s foes, particularly over its nuclear program, and sees that as a means to address the country\u2019s domestic issues. \u201cThe primary issue is the perspective: Do we want to solve our problems with the world or not? I believe we must get out of the deadlock to solve the country\u2019s problems,\u201d he said at a presidential debate ahead of the second round of voting. The leaders of Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Syria were among the first to congratulate Pezeshkian. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said he was \u201ckeen to develop and deepen the relations that bring together our two countries and peoples, and serve our common interests,\u201d according to state-run Saudi Press Agency. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he hoped Pezeshkian\u2019s election would expand bilateral cooperation \u201cin all areas\u201d in the interest of \u201csimplifying regional security and stability,\u201d according to a statement from the Kremlin. The US State Department acknowledged Pezeshkian\u2019s victory, but said the elections \u201cwere not free or fair\u201d and would \u201cnot have a significant impact on our approach to Iran.\u201d \u201cWe have no expectation these elections will lead to fundamental change in Iran\u2019s direction or more respect for the human rights of its citizens,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said. While the Iranian president does enjoy some powers, the ultimate authority lies with the Supreme Leader, who has the final say on all matters of state. Who is Masoud Pezeshkian? A health minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian is a trained heart surgeon and lawmaker. He gained prominence for his stance against the crackdown on the 2009 pro-democracy protests and violence perpetrated by the notorious morality police in 2022 in the wake of Mahsa Amini\u2019s death. Amini died in the custody of the morality police after being detained for not adhering to the Islamic Republic\u2019s strict dress code for women. Hundreds were killed and thousands arrested as the authorities sought to crush the protests, according to the United Nations. During the 2022 protests, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d \u201cI bear part of the blame, the distinguished religious scholars and the mosques bear part of the blame, and the (Iranian) broadcasting authority bears part of the blame,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody should step forward and be held accountable, rather than capture that girl, beat her up, and eventually deliver her body (to her family).\u201d He has presented himself as a candidate for all Iranians. \u201cAmong my supporters are both left and right, even those who do not pray,\u201d he said at a recent presidential debate. After losing his wife and one of his children in a 1994 car crash, he devoted much of his time to politics. Pezeshkian ran for president in the 2013 and 2021 elections, but failed to make headway. The 69-year-old hails from an ethnically mixed family \u2013 his father is Azeri and his mother is Kurdish. Persian isn\u2019t his mother tongue. That has burnished his image for Iran\u2019s minorities but left him open to xenophobic attacks from some opponents. Can he bring change to Iran? Experts say a more moderate face in the presidency could facilitate dialogue between Iran and Western states. Domestically, Pezeshkian may also introduce some social changes, which he emphasized during his electoral campaign, though experts caution that such moves are far from guaranteed. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, said it\u2019s unlikely that Pezeshkian\u2019s election would immediately translate into policy changes. \u201cBut Pezeshkian has made it clear that he will try to work through and within the system in order to perhaps accommodate a less repressive environment.\u201d The reformist did not guarantee that he could make those changes, Vakil said, adding that this demonstrates the limits of presidential powers in Iran. \u201cBut it may add a bit more room for maneuver on social freedoms,\u201d she noted. Ra\u2019na Rajabi, an Iranian woman, she was happy that Pezeshkian was elected. \u201cHonestly speaking, I just hope the expensiveness decreases, and jobs are easily found for young people, and that\u2019s it, I do not have any other special feelings,\u201d she said, adding that she hoped \u201cgirls and people can easily walk in the street without being anxious about anyone picking on them.\u201d Other factors may be more difficult to change, particularly Iran\u2019s foreign policy. Pezeshkian assumes the presidency at a time when his country is embroiled in escalating tensions with Israel and its Western allies, triggered by the war in Gaza and the advancement of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Just three months ago, Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened. Israel is now preparing for a potential second front against Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Rhetoric between Iran and Israel escalated last week as Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations said that should Israel \u201cembark on full-scale military aggression\u201d against Lebanon, then \u201can obliterating war will ensue.\u201d \u201cAll options, including the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table,\u201d it said on X. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded that \u201ca regime that threatens destruction deserves to be destroyed.\u201d Pezeshkian is not expected to change the current trajectory on Israel, experts said. He has also praised General Qasem Soleimani, the controversial head of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, who was assassinated in a US strike in 2020. \u201cI consider him a source of national pride and a thorn in the eyes of our enemies,\u201d he said in a recent presidential debate. A friendlier face to the West But while Western states aren\u2019t expecting this election to change their relationship with Iran, Pezeshkian is certainly their preferred candidate, as his opponent would have only escalated those existing tensions, experts said. Former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, a key ally of Pezeshkian and a reformist who oversaw a comparatively warm period of international relations nearly a decade ago, has been mooted as a potential candidate to reoccupy his old post under the new president. Zarif was Iran\u2019s top diplomat when the regime struck a deal with the US and world powers to limit Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief (a deal that has since all but collapsed). While he is popular among Iranian youth, he has also faced criticism from hardliners at home for being too friendly to the West. \u201cWith Mr. Pezeshkian, the sanctions will likely be lifted, and that\u2019s very good for people,\u201d Hossein Imani, a Tehran resident, said. \u201cI have a positive feeling (about Pezeshkian) for now, with the condition that he fulfils the promises he has made.\u201d Ahead of the elections, however, Supreme Leader Khamenei condemned those seeking improved relations with the West. And Pezeshkian has publicly stated that he would defer to Khamenei on matters of foreign policy, so Zarif\u2019s appointment is far from assured.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/middleeast/pezeshkian-wins-irans-vote-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_nigel-farage-reform-party-win-gbr-intl", "text": "Nigel Farage,\u00a0a driving force behind Britain\u2019s Brexit movement and a confidant of former US President Donald Trump, has been elected to parliament for the first time, as his upstart right-wing Reform UK party looks to shake up the country\u2019s politics. Farage becomes a member of Britain\u2019s parliament on his\u00a0eighth attempt after winning with 46.2% of the vote\u00a0in the heavily pro-Brexit Clacton, a seaside town on England\u2019s southeastern coast where Reform UK had polled well. With most of the votes now counted, results indicate Reform UK has won at least five seats in the House of Commons, a comparatively strong showing in Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system where smaller parties often struggle to translate their national support into parliamentary seats. Farage\u2019s Reform UK party attacked the Conservative Party on its failure to bring down rates of legal and illegal migration. That message appears to have won over a considerable number of socially conservative voters, with Reform UK candidates splitting the right-wing vote and contributing to the Conservatives\u2019 losses. Farage, an outspoken and polarizing figure, has long been known for using alarmist and confrontational language when discussing immigration. Since announcing his candidacy, Farage has warned supporters of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of asylum seekers, and last month he sparked outrage from political opponents after saying the West \u201cprovoked\u201d\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The veteran Euroskeptic, played a leading role in bringing about Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and has remained a divisive and disruptive figure in the country\u2019s politics since. Farage is perhaps best-known outside of the UK for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump, recently campaigning alongside him. But he has never been elected to parliament, losing seven elections since 1994 before this victory.\u00a0He won Clacton on a massive swing towards Reform UK, picking up 21,225 votes to the Conservatives\u2019 12,820. Friday\u2019s results now give Reform UK a small but significant base from which to oppose Labour leader and soon-to-be new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a crucial parliamentary platform. \u201cIt\u2019s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the center right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Farage said after winning the seat. He pledged to \u201cchallenge the general election properly in 2029,\u201d and promised to turn his rhetoric toward the Labour Party as it enters government. In many seats around the UK, Reform came second to Labour. Farage said the \u201cLabour government will be in trouble very, very quickly and we will now be targeting Labour votes. We\u2019re coming for Labour \u2013 be in no doubt about that.\u201d His presence during the election campaign upended the Conservative Party\u2019s efforts to win back socially conservative, pro-Brexit voters. His win comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge. Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. In snap French elections, far-right National Rally\u00a0won the first round last week. Speaking to CNN Thursday night, Politico deputy UK editor Rosa Prince said the result showed a \u201cvery widespread disaffection with the Conservative Party\u201d and that Reform UK\u2019s far-right policies \u201creally chime with some parts of the electorate.\u201d \u201cThe big question is going to be whether the Conservative Party tries to draw him in to them and maybe even join forces, or whether they push him away,\u201d Prince said. \u201cBecause what you could have is a total realignment of the right\u2026 I think Nigel Farage is certainly going to be causing trouble in the Houses of Parliament.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/nigel-farage-reform-party-win-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up. I do everything possible to make sure that I achieve my objectives and achieve the vision for which I started this organization.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_france-second-round-parliament-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Voters are turning out in high numbers across France to vote in the second round of a snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron, who risks losing swaths of his centrist allies in parliament and being forced to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with the far right. According to data published by the French Interior Ministry, 59.71% of French voters cast their vote by 5 p.m. Sunday (11 a.m. ET) - a level unseen since 1981. It marks a 20-point increase compared to the same time in 2022. After taking the lead in the first round of voting last Sunday, the far-right National Rally (RN) \u2013 led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella under the watchful eye of party doyenne Marine Le Pen \u2013 is closer to power than ever before. The RN, whose once-taboo brand of anti-immigrant politics has been given a fresh and more acceptable face by Bardella, won 33% of the popular vote in the first round. The newly-formed left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), came second with 28%, while Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance trailed in a distant third with 21%. But the prospect of a far-right government \u2013 which would be France\u2019s first since the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II \u2013 has spurred Ensemble and the NFP into action. After a week of political bargaining, hundreds of candidates stood down in particular seats to try to deny the RN an absolute majority. Voting began at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), as France began the process of electing the 577 members of its National Assembly, in which 289 seats are needed for a party to hold an absolute majority. In the outgoing parliament, Macron\u2019s alliance had only 250 seats, and so needed support from other parties to pass laws. Only those who win more than 12.5% of the votes of registered votes in the first round can stand in the second, meaning it is often fought between two candidates. But this time a record number of seats \u2013 more than 300 \u2013 produced a three-way run-off, in a measure of France\u2019s polarization. In an attempt not to split the anti-far right vote, more than 200 candidates from Macron\u2019s alliance and the NFP agreed to stand down in the second round. While RN\u2019s strong showing in the first round means it could more than triple the 88 seats it had in the outgoing parliament, it is not clear if it will be able to reach an absolute majority. Although it is customary for the president to appoint a prime minister from the largest party, Bardella has repeatedly said he will refuse to form a minority government. In that case, Macron might have to search for a prime minister on the hard left or, to form a technocratic government, somewhere else entirely. Whatever the result of Sunday\u2019s vote, France seems set to endure a period of political chaos, with Macron unable to call another parliamentary election for at least a year. The campaign has already been marred with violence. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Friday that 51 candidates and campaigners had been assaulted on the campaign trail, leading to some being hospitalized. The vote is being held three years earlier than necessary. France was not due to hold parliamentary elections until 2027, but Macron called the snap vote \u2013 the first time a French leader has done so since 1997 \u2013 after his party was trounced by the RN at last month\u2019s European Parliament elections. Although the European election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. Some have argued that, with the possibility of the RN winning both the presidency and the parliament in 2027, Macron was keen to expose it to government beforehand, in the hope that it would lose its appeal once in office. If the RN refuses to form a minority government, Macron\u2019s gamble could backfire. An RN-led government would have huge implications for France and the rest of Europe. Its spending plans \u2013 which include cutting value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products \u2013 have alarmed financial markets and could put France on a collision course with Brussels\u2019 restrictive spending laws. On the continental stage, an RN-led government would further Europe\u2019s rightward shift, at a time when the center is trying to remain united on issues like support for Ukraine, migration and climate change. Standing between the RN and an absolute majority is the NFP, comprising more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, a three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique\u2019s Raphael Gluckmann. While Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies said they will do everything in their power to stop the RN coming to power, it has refused to collaborate with or endorse candidates from France Unbowed. Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege and the outgoing prime minister, has vowed never to enter into alliance with Melenchon. Polls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-second-round-parliament-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_weather_heat-record-temperatures-saturday", "text": "The weekend is off to a sizzling start as more than one-third of US residents face heat advisories and additional cities are expected to see record temperatures in the coming days. The list includes customarily hot Las Vegas, where temperatures are expected to be near 114 degrees Saturday and even hotter Sunday, when it could break the daily record of 116. Nearly 130 million people in both the West and East are under heat alerts across 18 states and the District of Columbia. \u201cThese conditions will be extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if not taken seriously,\u201d meteorologists with the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center said in a forecast discussion. \u201cThe multi-day nature of the heat and record warm overnight temperatures will cause heat stress to build in people without adequate cooling and hydration.\u201d The dangerous heat will expand into the Intermountain West and northern High Plains by next week, forecasters say. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0weather service. In\u00a0San\u00a0Jose, California, a homeless man\u00a0died Tuesday due to the extreme heat, Mayor Matt Mahan said.\u00a0The man was 69, according to the mayor\u2019s spokesperson, Tasha Dean, citing information from the\u00a0Santa Clara Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. The same day, a 10-year-old\u00a0died in Arizona\u00a0after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, the Phoenix Police Department said. Also in Arizona, a 69-year-old hiker from Austin, Texas, died last week after hiking at the Grand Canyon, according to the National Park Service. Heat was a contributing factor, officials said. Major to extreme heat risk, the highest 2 levels, are expected for much of California and the Southwest on Saturday and Sunday, meaning health impacts from heat become more likely in anyone without adequate hydration or cooling. Even in the Pacific Northwest, the heat is punishing Parts of Oregon will experience triple digits up to five days with poor overnight relief, the\u00a0National Weather Service in Portland\u00a0said Friday. A\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0was declared in Multnomah County, Oregon\u2019s most populous county, for this weekend\u00a0as temperatures were expected to climb. \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend,\u201d Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno said in a news release. \u201cThey\u2019ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.\u201d Bruno said the area has had few hot days so far this year, and residents\u2019 bodies have not yet acclimated to the heat. Other areas of the West were experiencing unusual heat. Palm Springs, California, reached 124 degrees Friday afternoon, exceeding the previous all-time record high for the date of 123 degrees set in 2021. An all-time record high of 105 set in 2012 was broken in Raleigh, North Carolina, where temperatures of 106 degrees were recorded Friday. Additional daily record highs set Friday included: \u2022 127 degrees: Death Valley, California\u2022 114 degrees: San Jacinto, California\u2022 109 degrees:\u00a0Medford, Oregon\u2022 109 degrees: Campo, California The weather service said more than 35 million people in the contiguous United States will see temperatures in excess of 100 degrees in the next seven days. Conditions ripe for wildfire spread The extreme heat \u2013 combined with gusty winds and low humidity \u2013 means any wildfires that start will spread quickly through already parched vegetation. Red flag warnings are in effect through Saturday night across the West, including in the area of the\u00a0Thompson Fire, which has consumed more than 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday. The blaze, which was 71% contained by Saturday morning, has forced thousands of people to evacuate and prompted about 2,000 firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat and extremely dry conditions in the Oroville area. The wildfire has injured 11 firefighters, including eight who were affected by heat-related illnesses, according to Chris Peterson, a spokesperson for the\u00a0California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection\u00a0\u2013 also known as Cal Fire. Twenty-six structures have been destroyed by the blaze and more than 450 are under threat. In Central California, four firefighters have been injured battling the 908-acre French Fire about 55 miles north of Fresno, according to Cal Fire. The blaze is 25% contained. \u201cChallenges are immense. We\u2019re dealing with the increased temperatures, very steep and remote terrain,\u201d Cal Fire deputy director of communications Nick Schuler told CNN, adding \u201cthe ability for rapid growth from the amount of vegetation that\u2019s across the state is a challenge.\u201d The largest current fire in the state is on federal land, with the Basin Fire having consumed more than 14,000 acres. According to officials with Sierra National Forest, the fire is 46% contained and hasn\u2019t grown much in the past day. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with more than 150,000 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 8,674 acres burned by this time last year, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. There are now nearly two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest where\u00a0Cal Fire is the lead agency. California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0for the area of the Thompson Fire on Wednesday. The declaration cleared the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. It will feel like 110 in some areas of the South and mid-Atlantic As the West swelters, hazardous heat persists in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast and humidity will make it feel like up to 110 degrees at times.  Heat advisories are in place from the beaches of Alabama and Florida all the way to upstate New York. \u201cTake extra precautions when outside. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cTry to limit strenuous activities to early morning or evening.

{"id": "2024_07_04_uk_uk-election-results-tracker-map-2024-intl", "text": "The tectonic plates of British politics have shifted after Britons resoundingly voted to put an end to 14 years of Conservative rule, and deliver a landslide victory for the Labour Party. Labour\u2019s victory is bigger than the party could have imagined until fairly recently. At the last general election in 2019, it slumped to its worst defeat in more than 80 years and appeared set for a long period in the political wilderness. But the party has since rebuilt itself under the leadership of Keir Starmer, who will now become the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. Under Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post voting system, people in 650 constituencies across the nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have voted to select their member of parliament (MP) to represent the area, producing a flurry of results in the early hours of Friday morning before almost all the results were tallied later that day. The final result of the election will not be announced until Saturday morning, however, due to a recount in the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. A party needs 326 seats to officially win, a milestone that Labour cleared at around 5 a.m. local time on Friday, and the new government will have a commanding majority of more than 170 in the next parliament. Because of its electoral system, Britain can see large discrepancies between the share of seats won by a party and its share of the popular vote. If support for one party \u2013 or antipathy toward another \u2013 is spread fairly evenly across the country, it does not need to win a large share of the popular vote to win a huge majority of seats in parliament. Labour secured its landslide victory even as it won just about a third of the popular vote. The results represent one of the largest swings in British political history, and a stunning defeat for the Conservative Party after 14 years in government, bringing a brutal end to Rishi Sunak\u2019s premiership as his party lost around two-thirds of the 372 seats it was defending. Britain\u2019s traditional third party, the Liberal Democrats, also enjoyed a huge bump, going from just 11 seats won at the 2019 general election to more than 70 \u2013 its best result ever. Nigel Farage\u2019s right-wing, populist Reform UK party won its first five seats and came second in many more, splitting the right-wing vote and contributing to the Conservatives\u2019 losses. Meanwhile, in Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered a dismal night, with its number of seats slumping to just nine from 48 in 2019, as of Friday morning. Elsewhere across the UK, Sinn F\u00e9in became the largest Northern Irish party in parliament, winning seven of the 18 seats there. Its MPs do not take up their seats, as part of the party\u2019s refusal to recognize British sovereignty over Northern Ireland, given that it advocates for reuniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in the south.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/uk/uk-election-results-tracker-map-2024-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_jordan-bardella-national-rally-france-profile-intl", "text": "Jordan Bardella\u2019s rise to the peak of French politics has been so swift he is still asked about his teenage years spent playing \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d Next week, at the age of just 28, he could become France\u2019s prime minister \u2013 and Europe\u2019s youngest for more than 200 years. He\u2019s the fresh face of an old party that has striven to make itself new. Handpicked as leader by National Rally (RN) doyenne Marine Le Pen in an effort to purge the far-right party of its racist and antisemitic roots, Bardella has taken it closer to the gates of power than ever before. On Sunday, the RN smashed President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance in the first round of a snap parliamentary election. Whether the RN forms a government and Bardella becomes prime minister after the July 7 runoff is not clear. Despite the surge in support for the RN, France\u2019s left and centrist parties have called on their supporters to vote tactically to deny the far right an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. This week, more than 200 parliamentary candidates from Macron\u2019s alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) stepped down in a bid to avoid splitting the vote in the second round. But as Paris wraps a week of political bargaining, one thing is clear: France \u2013 and the rest of Europe \u2013 must reckon with the prospect of a far-right French government, headed by a popular but untested leader. So, who is Bardella, and what might his party do in power? The only child of Italian immigrants, Bardella was brought up in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb of Paris. He joined the RN at 16, and later began a geography degree at the prestigious Sorbonne university, before dropping out to climb the party ranks. He did so briskly. After becoming party spokesperson, he became the RN\u2019s lead candidate for the 2019 European Parliament election at the age of just 23. In 2022, after Le Pen narrowly lost the presidential election to Macron, he succeeded her as party leader, leapfrogging the party\u2019s long standing vice-president and Le Pen\u2019s former partner, Louis Aliot. Freed from the day-to-day management of the party, but almost certain to run again for the presidency in 2027, Le Pen has been able to freshen the RN\u2019s image and untether it from its reputation. Le Pen began her yearslong effort to detoxify the RN by ousting her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2013 a convicted Holocaust denier \u2013 from the party he founded, and later changing its name. The appointment and subsequent rise of Bardella may represent the completion of her mission to bring the party into the modern age. For many older voters, the prospect of a far-right government \u2013 reminiscent of the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II \u2013 remains terrifying. But among young people, not weighed down by this historical baggage, the party has proved hugely popular. While the RN\u2019s messaging has remained similar, the messenger has changed entirely. Suave, composed, unflappable, a child of the screen generation, Bardella has built up a huge TikTok following, where young voters can watch him tasting wine and doing shots. Even a video of him eating a bon-bon has been viewed 7.5 million times. In just two years, Bardella has helped to give the RN an acceptable \u2013 and potentially electable \u2013 face. Whereas Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance has sought to distance itself from the president\u2019s image, the RN\u2019s election manifesto is filled with splashy portraits of the prime minister-in-waiting. Fantasy promises? But campaigning and governing require different skills. If he becomes prime minister, Bardella will face the problem common to parties that make the leap from protest vote to credible governing force: How, after making extravagant promises as they rail against the mainstream, to avoid disappointing people once in office? Despite its freshened image, its decades-old philosophy remains the same: Immigrants threaten France\u2019s social fabric. The RN is committed to abolishing the birthright to citizenship for children of foreigners born on French soil, and to discriminate in favor of French citizens in welfare and public employment. But on other things in its 21-page manifesto, the RN is more vague. Detailing how it intends to \u201cpreserve French civilization,\u201d it says it will enact \u201cspecific legislation targeting Islamist ideologies,\u201d without elaborating, and that it will \u201cexperiment with the creation of a voluntary national heritage service.\u201d But already, the RN has begun to temper some of its more extreme nativist positions. After initially advocating to ban dual-citizenship, Bardella softened this stance, but maintained that \u201cthe most strategic positions\u201d within government will be reserved for French citizens. \u201cCan you imagine Franco-Russians working at the Ministry of the Armed Forces today?\u201d he said ahead of the first round. But the party has not yet provided a definition of \u201cstrategic positions.\u201d Could, for instance, the Spanish-born Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo remain in post, or would she have to renounce her Spanish citizenship? Mocking the vagueness of the RN\u2019s pledges, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon \u2013 the far-left leader of the France Unbowed party, which belongs to the New Popular Front coalition \u2013 has asked: \u201cWhat does Mr. Bardella want? We don\u2019t know. He says nothing. He\u2019s a good-looking guy, but what\u2019s his program? Throwing immigrants into the sea.\u201d Critics have said Bardella\u2019s chronic absence from key votes while he was a member of the European Parliament, and his lack of grasp of policy details, make him unfit to govern. In a recent debate with Gabriel Attal, the outgoing French prime minister and Macron\u2019s protege, Bardella confessed, with a smirk, to not having read the text of a bill he had voted against. On the economy, the RN has pledged to slash value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products from 20% to 5.5% and suspend it entirely for scores of basic necessities. While this may be appealing to voters, it has alarmed both Brussels and the financial markets. France is running one of the highest deficits in the eurozone and now risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules, which had been suspended to help countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. French government spending could soon be brutally constrained by Brussels, despite the lavish promises of the RN. \u201cTightening will be necessary next year, to bring France into compliance with EU expectations and rules,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at political risk consultancy the Eurasia Group, told CNN. If the RN falls short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, Bardella might choose not to govern. In bullish speeches before the first-round vote, he ruled out leading a minority government, which would require the support of allied parties to pass laws. While France might escape a far-right government for now, it faces the growing prospect of Le Pen becoming president in 2027, and then calling parliamentary elections to see Bardella installed as prime minister. The Meloni model? Since 2022, formerly fringe nativist parties hoping to govern have found a model to follow. After the technocratic government led by Mario Draghi collapsed in Italy, triggering a snap election, Giorgia Meloni became Italian prime minister, becoming the country\u2019s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini. Before she took office, Rome\u2019s allies thought a hard-right Italian government could compromise Western unity on support for Ukraine, pointing to Matteo Salvini, Meloni\u2019s deputy prime minister and a longtime admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin who used to don T-shirts emblazoned with his image. But Meloni\u2019s premiership has proven more moderate than many feared at the outset. While she has pursued hard-right policies domestically \u2013 seeking to limit abortion, surrogacy and even removing lesbian mothers\u2019 names from their children\u2019s birth certificates \u2013 she has largely toed a mainstream line on foreign policy issues. Might the RN adopt this bifurcated strategy? The RN is notoriously euroskeptic, but talk of a \u201cFrexit\u201d has cooled - perhaps because Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union proved an act of serious economic self-harm, and perhaps because hard-right leaders \u2013 like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban \u2013 have shown it is easier to weaken the bloc from the inside than from without. With that aim, the RN has promised to cut funding to the EU by up to 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion), partly to fund tax cuts at home. But, with EU budgets agreed on a seven-year basis and the current one running until 2027, the RN cannot legally renege on France\u2019s spending commitments. Bardella has also ruled out sending French troops to Ukraine \u2013 an idea floated by Macron \u2013 and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. But a Bardella premiership could tip France into a constitutional crisis. While the National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws and the prime minister controls the budget, the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the prime minister and president belong to different parties \u2013 in a rare arrangement known as \u201ccohabitation\u201d \u2013 things can grind to a halt. With Macron set to see out his term, which finishes in 2027, the line between domestic and foreign issues may become blurred. If Macron pursues a foreign policy that requires parliament to pass large spending bills, it is not clear whose preferences would prevail: his or Bardella\u2019s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/jordan-bardella-national-rally-france-profile-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_france-election-what-next-explainer-intl", "text": "On Sunday night, joy: French voters had, once again, kept the far right out of power. On Monday morning, uncertainty: A hung parliament, shaky alliances and the threat of turbulent years ahead. President Emmanuel Macron called France\u2019s snap parliamentary election to \u201cclarify\u201d the political situation. But after the shock second-round results, the waters are more muddied than they have been in decades. While a surge in support for the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition foiled Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party, French politics is now more disordered than it was before the vote. So, what did we learn last night, who might be France\u2019s next prime minister, and has Macron\u2019s gamble \u201cpaid off?\u201d A shock victory, but not a decisive one After leading the first round of voting last Sunday, the RN was closer to the gates of power than ever before, and was on the cusp of forming France\u2019s first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But after a week of political bargaining, in which more than 200 left-wing and centrist candidates withdrew from the second round in a bid to avoid splitting the vote, the NFP \u2013 a cluster of several parties from the extreme left to the more moderate \u2013 emerged with the most seats in the decisive second round. The NFP won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group in the 577-seat parliament. Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which trailed in a distant third in the first round, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. And the RN and its allies, despite leading the first round, won 143 seats. Does that mean the NFP \u201cwon\u201d the election? Not quite. Although the coalition has the most seats, it fell well short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, meaning France now has a hung parliament. If this was a victory for anything, it was the \u201ccordon sanitaire,\u201d the principle that mainstream parties must unite to prevent the extreme right from taking office. The far right kept at bay, but more potent than ever It was meant to be a coronation. Crowds of supporters had crammed into election night events at the RN party HQ in Paris and at outposts all over the country, to watch the moment many felt had been decades in the making: Confirmation that their party, and its long-taboo brand of anti-immigrant politics, had won the most seats in the French parliament. That wasn\u2019t to be. The fervent atmosphere soured as supporters saw the RN had slumped to third place. Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader handpicked by Le Pen to freshen the party\u2019s image and purge it of its racist and antisemitic roots, was dyspeptic. He railed against the \u201cdangerous electoral deals\u201d made between the NFP and Ensemble which had \u201cdeprived the French people\u201d of an RN-led government. \u201cBy deciding to deliberately paralyze our institutions, Emmanuel Macron has now pushed the country towards uncertainty and instability,\u201d Bardella said, dismissing the NFP as an \u201calliance of dishonor.\u201d Still, the RN\u2019s success should not be underestimated. In the 2017 elections, when Macron swept to power, the RN won just eight seats. In 2022, it surged to 89 seats. In Sunday\u2019s vote, it won 125 \u2013 making it the largest individual party. That unity means it will likely remain a potent force in the next parliament, while the solidity of the leftist coalition remains untested. Will the left remain united? A month ago, the NFP did not exist. Now, it is the largest bloc in the French parliament and could provide France with its next prime minister. It chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. Sunday\u2019s results mean it has done so again. But while it achieved its founding purpose, it is unclear whether this capacious \u2013 and potential fractious \u2013 coalition will hold. The hastily assembled bloc comprises several parties: the far-left France Unbowed party; the Socialists; the green Ecologists; the center-left Place Publique and others. This many-headed hydra does not speak with a single voice. Each party celebrated the results at their own campaign events, rather than together. Two of its most prominent figures \u2013 Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the populist France Unbowed leader, and Raphael Glucksmann, the more moderate leader of Place Publique \u2013 are barely on speaking terms. Disagreements over economic and foreign policies could spill over, as the NFP\u2019s expansive spending plans \u2013 which include raising the minimum wage, capping the price of certain foods and energy and scrapping Macron\u2019s pension reforms \u2013 collide with the European Union\u2019s restrictive fiscal rules and France\u2019s need to rein in its ballooning deficit. A better night for Macron than expected, but he emerges weakened Macron once said his thoughts are \u201ctoo complex\u201d for journalists. Still, his decision to call a snap election \u2013 three years earlier than necessary, and with his party way behind in the polls \u2013 baffled the sharpest of political analysts, caught even his closest allies off guard and left many French voters confused. He called the vote minutes after his party was trounced by the RN in last month\u2019s European Parliament elections. Although European results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. But Sunday\u2019s results suggest he has achieved the opposite. \u00c9duoard Philippe, France\u2019s former prime minister and an ally of Macron, said what was \u201cintended as a clarification has instead led to great vagueness.\u201d Although Macron\u2019s party recovered from the first round, it lost around 100 seats compared to the 2022 election. Where does France go from here? Macron\u2019s first decision is to appoint a new prime minister. He has already delayed this process by declining Gabriel Attal\u2019s resignation, asking him to stay in office for now. Typically, the French president appoints a prime minister from the largest bloc in parliament. But it is unclear from which party within the NFP this will be. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party won the most seats within the NFP, but Macron\u2019s allies have repeatedly refused to work with France Unbowed, saying it is just as extreme \u2013 and therefore as unfit to govern \u2013 as the RN. In order to reach the majority needed to pass laws, the NFP will likely have to enter into alliances with Ensemble \u2013 as two coalitions enter an even larger coalition, straddling vast ideological ground. Finding common ground will be a fraught task, meaning gridlock is likely. Without a clear majority, a minority government faces the risk of no-confidence votes as soon as this month, which could lead to several governments replacing each other. One way out could be a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d government, which would involve Macron appointing ministers with no party affiliation to manage day-to-day matters. But these can come to seem undemocratic and can further fan the flames of populism. Just look at Italy: after the premiership of Mario Draghi, the technocrat par excellence, the country elected its most far-right government since Benito Mussolini. While France avoided a far-right government for now, the RN threat is likely to remain strong.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/europe/france-election-what-next-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_asia_india-narendra-modi-russia-visit-intl", "text": "India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Russia on Monday for his first visit to the country since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a sign that the two nations remain close despite the Kremlin\u2019s deepening dependence on China. During his two-day visit, Modi is expected to attend a private dinner hosted by Vladimir Putin and hold talks with the Russian president, according to India\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. The summit will \u201cprovide an opportunity to the two leaders to review the whole range of bilateral issues,\u201d Jaiswal told reporters in New Delhi last week, adding that Modi and Putin will \u201calso share perspectives on regional and global developments of mutual interest.\u201d India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Trade between the two countries was worth nearly $65 billion in 2023-24, primarily due to strong energy cooperation,\u00a0but most of that total flowed toward Russia, Jaiswal said. Reducing the trade imbalance would be a \u201cmatter of priority\u201d in Modi\u2019s discussions with Putin, he added. Modi last met with Putin on the sidelines of the 2022 SCO meeting in Uzbekistan, when he told the Russian leader: \u201cNow is not the time for war.\u201d But while India has called for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and restoration of peace, it has also abstained from all resolutions on Ukraine at the United Nations and stopped short of condemning Russia\u2019s invasion. \u201cI look forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues,\u201d Modi said in a statement from his office before departing for Russia. \u201cWe seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking in the wake of Russia\u2019s deadly attacks on Ukraine Monday, said it was a \u201chuge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\u201d Following Modi\u2019s arrival, Putin showed the Indian leader around his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo in the Moscow region. They greeted each other with a hug, chatted over tea and rode around in an electric vehicle. Putin also showed Modi the stables and they watched a horse show. The trip is Modi\u2019s first bilateral visit since winning a third consecutive term in a massive general election last month and is seen as a rare break in convention for an Indian leader who typically travels to neighboring countries such as Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The visit also comes as Russia draws ever closer to China, potentially making New Delhi uncomfortable due to its longstanding Himalayan border dispute with Beijing, which has simmered in recent years. Modi\u2019s trip follows Putin\u2019s return from Kazakhstan, where the Russian leader last week attended the annual leaders\u2019 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a bloc of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia, at which he claimed\u00a0Moscow-Beijing relations were experiencing \u201cthe best period in their history.\u201d For India, that burgeoning relationship is \u201ca matter of deep concern,\u201d\u00a0said Nandan Unnikrishnan, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. \u201cThat is one of the reasons that Mr. Modi is undertaking this trip because traditionally, the Soviet Union and then subsequently Russia, has been a balancer in our relationship with China, which has been not the best since the late \u201950s of the last century,\u201d he said. Despite India being an SCO member, Modi was visibly absent from the meeting in Kazakhstan, indicating to some analysts that the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy does not view the bloc as an effective channel through which New Delhi can pursue its interests. Modi\u2019s visit to Russia is also widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. Despite undermining Western sanctions by purchasing large quantities of Russian oil, New Delhi has remained close with the United States, a key partner as both countries share concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a\u00a0state visit to Washington\u00a0in June last year, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. India is a member of the Quad security grouping with the US, Japan and Australia. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine. Following his Russia trip, Modi will visit Austria in the Indian leader\u2019s first visit to the European nation, according to his office.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/asia/india-narendra-modi-russia-visit-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Vatican said in a statement that the prelate had refused to \u201crecognize and submit\u201d to the authority of the pope, and had rejected \u201ccommunion\u201d with members of the Catholic Church and its authoritative teachings. In 2018, Vigan\u00f2 released a bombshell dossier calling on Francis to resign and\u00a0accusing the pope of knowing about allegations of abuse\u00a0of trainee priests carried out by the former cardinal of Washington, DC, Theodore McCarrick, and failing to act.\u00a0A Vatican inquiry later challenged Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account\u00a0and cleared Francis. As a Vatican diplomat, the archbishop was tasked with serving the pope, which makes his excommunication for schism highly unusual. The ruling means the archbishop cannot receive the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church, such as communion. The Vatican explained Friday that Vigan\u00f2 was excommunicated following an \u201cextrajudicial penal process,\u201d although the archbishop has said he did not \u201crecognize the legitimacy\u201d of the process. Recently, the archbishop has said Francis\u2019 election to the papacy should be considered \u201cnull and void\u201d and has instead accused the pope of \u201cheresy and schism.\u201d He has accused the pontiff of supporting what he called the \u201cclimate fraud\u201d and has criticized him for backing Covid-19 vaccines and for promoting an\u00a0\u201cinclusive, immigrationist, eco-sustainable, and gay-friendly\u201d church.

The Vatican later said the meeting \u201cshould not be considered a form of support of her position.\u201d Following Vigan\u00f2\u2019s 2018 call for the pope to resign, several bishops in the US issued statements of support for the archbishop, which were\u00a0criticized by some commentators. For some, the archbishop had been seen as an effective diplomat and official in years gone by. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See\u2019s Secretary of State, said recently about the now-excommunicated archbishop.

{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_france-election-results-gamble-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "\u201cI threw my live grenade at their feet\u201d is how French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly saw his call for snap elections after a stinging far-right victory in June\u2019s European elections. It was an explosive gamble and the\u00a0final\u00a0results took the country by surprise:\u00a0France\u2019s left-wing alliance coming in first with 182 seats and the far-right trailing in third place - a shocking reversal of last Sunday\u2019s first-round results. On Place de la Republique in Paris news of the projected results was met with rapturous applause and fireworks as people embraced one another, breathing a collective sigh of relief:\u00a0in their eyes,\u00a0France had been pulled back from the brink. Turnout on Sunday was the highest in a parliamentary election for more than 20 years as French citizens took to the ballot box to make their feelings known: they did not want the far-right to govern. However, with the left falling short of the 289 seats needed for a majority and with a weakened\u00a0president, the national assembly is expected to be more fractured than ever. What\u2019s certain is that France is set to enter a prolonged period of instability as three opposing blocs with competing ideas and agendas try to form coalition or find themselves stuck in a state of paralysis. Visibly disappointed, the far-right National Rally (RN) leader Jordan Bardella argued that\u00a0his\u00a0party\u2019s defeat was only made possible by the tactical voting orchestrated by\u00a0Macron and the\u00a0left-wing\u00a0NFP\u00a0coalition that\u00a0decided to withdraw 200 candidates from the race this week in an effort to block the far right. Though the RN didn\u2019t do as well as expected, it is still a victory for French far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen with her party\u00a0getting more votes with each passing election. 8 in 2017, 89 in 2022, 143 in 2024 \u2013 the latter with the help of allies. For the left-wing\u00a0NFP alliance,\u00a0it is\u00a0going to have a tough time speaking with one voice. The last time\u00a0it formed a bloc under the name of Nupes, in 2022,\u00a0it\u00a0fell apart\u00a0because of personal differences as well as policy. The bloc brings together five different parties. Far-left France Unbowed and the\u00a0Communist party\u00a0has\u00a0joined with the center-left parties, the socialists and the greens to form\u00a0a\u00a0New Popular Front. Now\u00a0the challenge\u00a0is no longer whether\u00a0the left\u00a0can unite against the far right, but rather can\u00a0the different groups\u00a0work together to agree first on who might be prime minister from their camp \u2013 and then on the policies they might pursue? How instability might impact internationally With such a divided parliament there is no hope for major structural reforms at a domestic level, the best\u00a0the leftists can hope for are\u00a0ad hoc alliances to vote through individual pieces of legislation. It\u2019s equally hard to imagine how the current constellation would allow France to play an important role regarding Ukraine.\u00a0Macron in the past has vowed to continue supporting Ukraine militarily while\u00a0Le Pen has said her\u00a0party would prevent Kyiv using French-supplied long-range weapons to strike inside Russia\u00a0and would oppose sending French troops. The left has remained relatively quiet on Ukraine - different parties from the coalition have slightly different stances - France Unbowed is against what\u00a0it\u00a0calls\u00a0\u201cescalation\u201d\u00a0with Russia. Macron\u2019s central bloc seems to have held up quite well,\u00a0winning 163 seats. Even though it lost roughly\u00a0100\u00a0MPs, it\u2019s a much better result than what the polls were suggesting, although we will see a shift in power from the Elys\u00e9e to the National Assembly. Macron\u2019s gamble may have prevented the far right from coming to power, but it could\u00a0yet\u00a0plunge the country into chaos.

After telling the construction crew to go home for the day, artifacts like pottery, old and broken dishes, glassware, bottles and more bones were unearthed from the loose, sandy\u00a0terrain\u00a0filled with bricks. With guidance and inspection from a local museum and a specialist in early porcelain dating, the items were roughly dated\u00a0from the early 1700s up through the mid-1800s. The bones didn\u2019t belong to human bodies but to\u00a0animals \u2013\u00a0including\u00a0a possible jawbone from a wild boar. \u201cThe guess right now is maybe (the spot) is either a root cellar that was associated with an early home or a cistern for water storage, again associated with another early home in the city,\u201d Cinci said. The\u00a0North Carolina Office of State Archaeology\u00a0from the Raleigh and Greenville offices were called in to possibly further identify and date the items. Five days later, the ground was excavated, according to\u00a0CNN affiliate WTKR. After the state office agreed with the artifacts\u2019 initial dating estimate, they\u00a0were\u00a0labeled and placed on\u00a0plates in the church\u2019s kitchen until they can\u00a0be sent away for further testing.  Cenci was told that either a team from the Raleigh or Greenville archeology offices may return to the site, a graduate student from a local university would be tasked with continuing the excavation or the church\u00a0could\u00a0hire an outside archaeological firm. Due to the church being on private property and the lack of requirement for environmental review and permitting, the North Carolina Office of State Archaeology is not directly involved in the project past its initial assessments, Michele Walker, a representative for the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources told CNN in a statement Monday. Christ Episcopal Church\u00a0was founded in 1825\u00a0but the building it currently occupies wasn\u2019t built until 1856, according to Cenci. From research done by church parishioners\u00a0Ian Lowry, Robyn Nix and Sam Moncla,\u00a0who dug into deeds, wills and estate documents at the Pasquotank County courthouse, the group has discovered a Black man named George Davis used to own the property in the early 1800s that the church sits on \u2013 on two of the most premier lots in the city. His daughter Charlotte was married in the Episcopal church in 1833, according to church records and as posted by\u00a0Lowry on Facebook.\u00a0Nothing is confirmed yet, but some of the artifacts are thought to have been owned by Davis, Cenci explained. \u201cWe can safely say that Mr. Davis was living there, and we can also safely say that the bulk of artifacts found thus far fit into the time period of his occupancy,\u201d Lowry wrote in an email. \u201c(Davis) did very well for himself based on the items that have come out of the excavation site,\u201d Cenci said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found bottles of French wine and we found imported porcelain from China \u2026 It seems we have uncovered the history of an early African American in our community that was quite influential (and) quite affluent in the town which I think is really interesting.\u201d Cenci said all he did was stop the construction; Lowry, Nix and Moncla are \u201creally the heroes in this story as far as finding out what was in there and why it matters.\u201d With the church being founded in 1825, this discovery comes just in time for its 200th anniversary. \u201cAs a Christian, I believe it\u2019s God\u2019s providential timing that it would happen right as we\u2019re coming into our 200th anniversary,\u201d Cenci said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting\u00a0this \u2013 almost like a time capsule \u2013\u00a0back to when the church was founded.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/style/north-carolina-artifacts-church/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_popes-chief-of-staff-london-property-trial-intl-latam", "text": "One of Pope Francis\u2019 closest aides has undergone an intense cross-examination as he gave evidence in a case that marks the first time the Vatican has stood trial in an English court. Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, who holds the role of \u201csostituto\u201d (\u201csubstitute\u201d), the equivalent of a papal chief of staff, took the witness stand in a dispute over the Holy See\u2019s disastrous investment in a London property, the center of the Vatican\u2019s\u00a0\u201ctrial of the century\u201d. The archbishop\u2019s appearance in court is rare given the Vatican and its senior officials have largely avoided legal actions in foreign courts \u2013 often concerning sexual abuse cases \u2013 under the protection of sovereign immunity. But the London legal action is believed to be the first time the Vatican has stood trial in a foreign jurisdiction, while Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra is one of the highest-ranking Vatican officials to give evidence in such a case. The 64-year-old Venezuelan archbishop wore a black clerical suit during his evidence and began by swearing an oath on \u201calmighty God\u201d that he would tell the truth. Although he was occasionally assisted by an interpreter, he answered questions in English. Over more than a day and a half of cross-examination, the archbishop insisted several times that he is a \u201cpriest, and not a specialist in banking\u201d as he explained that the Vatican had been the victim of extortion in the property deal. The case against the Holy See has been bought by Raffaele Mincione, an Italian-British financier who was among those convicted by a Vatican court last December of embezzlement and self-laundering for his part in the London property deal. Mincione has denied all the charges against him and is appealing his convictions. That trial marked the first time a cardinal was convicted and sentenced by a Vatican court for financial crimes and is considered an important moment\u00a0in Pope Francis\u2019 long battle to clean up the Vatican\u2019s finances. But Mincione is now seeking a ruling in the London courts that he acted in\u00a0\u201cgood faith\u201d throughout his dealings with the Vatican, which concerned\u00a0investments in a\u00a0vast property in southwest London\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood,\u00a0originally\u00a0built as a car showroom for the Harrods department store. The Holy See says it spent around $400 million on the deal over several years but ended up with losses of $150 million after eventually selling the asset. In 2014, the Vatican invested $200 million for a 45% stake in the Chelsea property through a fund run by Mincione, whose companies had purchased the building for around $165 million (\u00a3129.5 million) at the end of 2012. Although there was a plan to turn the property into apartments, the Vatican says the property\u2019s value was inflated by Mincione and that it was losing money on its investment. Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra, who was not in post at the time of the original investment, sought to exit the deal by buying the building outright and, in the process, the Holy See paid \u00a340 million to Mincione. The Vatican says this was a \u201cfraudulent overpayment.\u201d Helping to broker the exit deal in 2018 from Mincione\u2019s fund was another financier, Gianluigi Torzi, who was also convicted at the Vatican trial last December. He was found to have structured a deal which left him in control of the building and the Vatican purchasing an\u00a0\u201cempty box\u201d. Torzi was then accused of extorting around $16 million from the Vatican as Pe\u00f1a Parra and his office sought to finally gain control of the Chelsea building. The property was eventually sold by the Holy See in 2022 for around $229 million. Under cross-examination the archbishop was questioned repeatedly about the Torzi payments and was accused by Mincione\u2019s barrister of dishonesty because the payments to Torzi involved a false invoice. The archbishop admitted to sending a false invoice but said Torzi had \u201ctrapped\u201d the Vatican and would \u201clie and lie.\u201d Pe\u00f1a Parra told the judge repeatedly that he had been trying to extricate the Holy See from a bad deal and gain control of the building. The archbishop, who became the Vatican number three in October 2018, said he only became aware of Torzi\u2019s schemes later and that some of his staff were \u201csuperficial and na\u00efve.\u201d He insisted that now \u201cI would give Torzi nothing, and I would put him in jail several times.\u201d Mincione\u2019s lawyers have accused the Vatican of an \u201cincoherent and confused allegation of conspiracy\u201d against their client, while the Holy See insist that Mincione did not act in good faith. Mincione was also cross examined during the trial, with lawyers accusing him of producing \u201cgrossly misleading\u201d figures about the Chelsea property\u2019s value. The heart of the dispute concerns the value of the Chelsea property. The Vatican\u2019s legal team said the stated value of \u00a3275 million ($350 million) for the London property in 2018 was a \u201cfraudulent representation\u201d of its market worth, while Mincione\u2019s lawyers denied this, saying it was an \u201caudited valuation.\u201d In his witness statement, Pe\u00f1a Parra said he was told of \u201cconcerns\u201d that the value of the building was less than the Vatican had \u201coriginally thought.\u201d The trial is expected to conclude later this month with a judgment likely to be released later in the year. The archbishop is due to conclude giving evidence on Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/popes-chief-of-staff-london-property-trial-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

Lt Col. Peter Lerner said that while speaking with the world\u2019s media on behalf of the military, he came to realize the \u201closs of international trust in Israel and the government\u2019s failure to maintain widespread support for the war against Hamas over time.\u201d\u00a0Lerner served in the IDF for more than 25 years \u2013 most recently as a spokesman during the war, before stepping down last month. Lerner was speaking in an extended interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. \u201cNetanyahu promised a complete victory over Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the international arena he and his government led us to defeat.\u201d Lerner told Haaretz that in the early days of the conflict, following Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on October 7, \u201cThere was a clear understanding that Hamas is an evil and dangerous organization, and that Israel must act against it.\u201d That goodwill quickly eroded, he said, partly because of the inevitable suffering of Palestinian civilians as the IDF began the ground invasion of Gaza. But he also blamed the government, saying \u201cthere is no political strategy for the war, even after nine months in which we are fighting on two fronts.\u201d Lerner said that as he was increasingly asked about the goals of the operation, \u201cI quickly realized that I had no answers to these questions, not because they haven\u2019t been decided yet, but because they simply aren\u2019t going to be decided.\u201d He said he felt like \u201ca soldier who goes to guard without cartridges\u2026 I don\u2019t have the ammunition I need to deal with the interviewers\u2019 questions. I just had to say that I am speaking on behalf of the army, and that these questions are the responsibility of the government. But the government also had no answers, because it was politically inconvenient.\u201d Lerner was also critical of ministers who \u2013 he maintained \u2013 had reduced the legitimacy of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. \u201cHamas damaged almost all the power lines that connect Gaza to Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had the opportunity to come and say: Hamas is harming the citizens of Gaza, and we, Israel, will try to fix it, but only if he stops the shooting. Instead, the Minister of Energy at the time, Israel Katz, comes out with populist statements about the fact that he will cut them off from electricity and will not deliver fuel to them either.\u201d Lerner quoted a remark by Netanyahu in 2016 that the test in the field of propaganda is very simple: Were your hands tied when you wanted to defend yourself? He said the Prime Minister had failed that test \u201cmiserably. The US and the UK are cancelling arm s shipments, France forbids us to participate in a large arms exhibition. We delayed for months the entrance to Rafah. This issue requires a state inquiry commission, just like the failures of October 7.\u201d Lerner\u2019s remarks follow multiple accounts of tensions between Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s military leadership. Last week, Netanyahu rejected the idea of starting a ceasefire in Gaza while Hamas remains in power, after the New York Times published an article\u00a0citing six current and former security officials who said a truce would give Israeli troops time to prepare for a potential land war with Hezbollah. The officials, most of whom spoke anonymously to \u201cdiscuss sensitive security matters,\u201d also said a truce would be the most effective way to secure the release of the Israeli hostages. Former Israeli National Security Advisor Eyal Hulata, who according to the Times maintains regular communication with \u201csenior miliary officials,\u201d spoke on the record, saying, \u201cthe military is in full support of a hostage deal and a cease-fire\u2026 they believe that they can always go back and engage Hamas militarily in the future.\u201d In a statement, Netanyahu said, \u201cI do not know who these anonymous sources are, but I am here to make it unequivocally clear: This will not happen. The war will end once Israel achieves all of its objectives, including the destruction of Hamas and the release of all of our hostages.\u201d That report came days after Israel\u2019s\u00a0top military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Hamas could not be destroyed, and that anyone who claimed otherwise was \u201cthrowing sand in the eyes of the public\u201d \u2013 an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, who has repeatedly pledged to eliminate the group.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/middleeast/idf-former-spokesman-blames-government-war-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_weather_hurricane-beryl-south-texas-coast-weekend-sunday-monday", "text": "Tropical Storm Beryl is expected to strengthen into a hurricane again before it reaches the South Texas coast on Monday, bringing damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge and dangerous flooding beginning late Sunday. It\u2019s expected to mark the first US landfall storm of the 2024 Atlantic season. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022 Beryl to hit Texas as a hurricane: Beryl is forecast to make landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas, as a Category 1 hurricane Monday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. Currently a tropical storm, Beryl is in the Gulf of Mexico about 245 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, fanning maximum winds of 60 mph as of 5 a.m. ET Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. The state is likely to start seeing the effects of Beryl starting Sunday and several counties have already announced evacuation orders. \u2022\u00a0Hurricane and storm surge alerts: Hurricane warnings are in effect for the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to Sargent, while the stretches south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, and north of Sargent to San Luis Pass, are under hurricane watches. A tropical storm warning is also in place for the area north of Sargent to High Island, and the Mexican coast from Barra el Mezquital to the Rio Grande. Storm surge warnings are in effect from the north entrance of the Padre Island National Seashore to High Island, including Corpus Christi Bay, Matagorda Bay and Galveston Bay. The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande River northward to North Entrance of the Padre Island National Seashore, as well as San Luis Pass to Sabine Pass are under storm surge watch. \u2022\u00a0Dangerous storm surge along US Gulf Coast: Tropical storm conditions will begin to be felt along the western Gulf Coast on Sunday, with hurricane conditions expected later in the day. Storm surge up to 6 feet is forecast for parts of the Texas coast late Sunday night into Monday as rising waters push inland from the shoreline. Rip currents will also cause life-threatening beach conditions through Monday across much of the Gulf Coast. \u2022\u00a0Flooding and damaging winds expected: Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with localized amounts of 15 inches, is forecast across the Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas late Sunday through the middle of next week, the National Hurricane Center said. It\u2019s expected to produce flash and urban flooding. Hurricane-force winds will hit the lower and middle Texas coast Sunday night and Monday. A few tornadoes could also occur along the Texas Coast Sunday afternoon and evening. \u201cPreparations should be rushed to completion before tropical storm conditions begin late today,\u201d the hurricane center said Sunday morning. \u2022 At least nine dead due to Beryl: Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic on record earlier this week. The storm killed at least nine people in the Caribbean, including two in Jamaica, three in Venezuela, three in Grenada and one person in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. After hammering several Caribbean islands, the storm unloaded strong winds, torrential rainfall and dangerous storm surge over much of Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. \u2022 Beryl worsened by climate change: The\u00a0abnormally warm ocean waters\u00a0fueling Beryl\u2019s intensification show this hurricane season will be far from normal. Beryl\u2019s blow to Jamaica was worsened by climate change,\u00a0a new rapid attribution analysis from ClimaMeter found. Modern storms like Beryl tracking close to Jamaica are capable of unloading 30% more rain and 10% stronger winds compared to the similar storms from 1979 to 2001 because of human-caused climate change, the study found. \u2022 How to help those affected: Jamaican residents are assessing the damage after Beryl pounded the Caribbean island with destructive winds and storm surge. The storm killed two people in the country and left hundreds of thousands of homes without power. Beryl was the strongest storm to impact the country in more than 15 years. Beryl also caused major damage\u00a0across the region, including in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados and Grenada. Several charities are\u00a0actively distributing aid\u00a0throughout the region. Contribute to relief efforts here. Texas officials ask coastal residents to be prepared to leave Texas officials are urging residents to prepare before Beryl\u2019s expected hit to coastal areas later this weekend. \u201cEveryone along the coast should be paying attention to this storm,\u201d Texas\u00a0Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said during a briefing on Friday. \u201cWe pray and we hope for nothing more than a rain event, but even a rain event may be very heavy,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cWe prepare at the state for the worst-case scenario.\u201d Already, several counties have asked residents to evacuate due to the potentially dangerous conditions Beryl could bring. Gov. Greg Abbott has also issued severe weather disaster declarations for 40 counties, as the state contends with \u201cheavy rainfall, flooding conditions, and strong tropical wind.\u201d Matagorda County issued a voluntary evacuation order ahead of Beryl\u2019s arrival, the county\u2019s Emergency Operation Center said on social media. The order calls for people to voluntarily evacuate coastal areas in the county, including Sargent, Matagorda and Palacios. Aransas County issued an evacuation order for residents of \u201clow-lying areas and flood-prone areas and persons with special needs requirements\u201d at 6 p.m. local time. There are no emergency shelter facilities in the county, according to the county\u2019s Facebook announcement, and \u201cmedical and emergency services will likely be affected by the effects of the predicted landfall of Hurricane Beryl.\u201d A mandatory evacuation was ordered Saturday afternoon for all residents of Refugio County, County Judge Jhiela Poynter announced in a\u00a0Facebook post. The county has a population of more than 6,600 people. Poynter said that they know how quickly things can escalate, given that they are still rebuilding infrastructure from when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017. \u201cI would rather be cautious and let Tropical Storm Beryl come crawling in with a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind to an empty\u00a0Refugio\u00a0County than the alternative if it were to strengthen more than the predictions, which we know has happened with several storms in the past,\u201d Poynter said. During the storm, the county\u2019s local hospital will be rerouting emergency patients, city water will eventually be turned off and city ambulances and fire trucks will no longer be able to mobilize, Poynter said. City officials will provide bus transportation to an out-of-town emergency shelter for residents who are unable to evacuate on their own, Poynter said. The City of Port Aransas, on Mustang Island,\u00a0issued\u00a0a mandatory visitor evacuation by noon Sunday, which does not include residents and property owners, according to the city. In Kleberg\u00a0County, Judge Rudy Madrid issued a \u201cVoluntary Evacuation for Baffin Bay, Loyola Beach and all low lying areas,\u201d according to a social media post from the city of Kingsville. Nueces\u00a0County\u00a0Judge Connie Scott asked citizens on the coast in low-lying areas or who need assistance to evacuate due to the possibility of the storm making landfall in the\u00a0area\u00a0as a hurricane, the county posted on social media. The National Weather Service in Corpus Christi is warning residents, \u201cnow would be the time to prepare\u201d for Beryl as its track forecast is trending farther north along the Texas coast. \u201cResidents should really be aware that the earliest \u2026 arrival of the tropical storm force winds is predicted for Sunday afternoon,\u201d Mayor Paulette Guajardo said on Friday. The mayor declared a local state of disaster Saturday afternoon, taking effect immediately. Guajardo asked those visiting the city for the Fourth of July weekend to \u201cplease consider returning at an earlier time if it\u2019s what you feel you need to do.\u201d In Houston, the weather service is likewise asking people to stay vigilant. \u201cAt this time, the main impacts for SE TX will remain increased rainfall (Mon/Tues) and the potential for tropical storm force winds (34kts) as early as Sun morning. Stay tuned and stay informed,\u201d the weather service\u00a0posted on X. The city of Rockport issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in low-lying areas and local officials are in touch with the state to place their residents on the registry for evacuations if necessary, police spokesperson Lee Brown told CNN on Saturday. While no local hurricane shelter had been established in the area, charter buses will be ready to evacuate residents at the Aransas County Airport on Saturday evening, Brown said. Rockport, 30 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, suffered major damage\u00a0from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Voluntary evacuations have been announced for some low-lying areas in Port Lavaca, northeast of Rockport. City spokesperson Tania French said about 1,000 people, mostly in beach areas, may be affected.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/weather/hurricane-beryl-south-texas-coast-weekend-sunday-monday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_weather_west-coast-california-oregon-heat-wave", "text": "An extremely dangerous, unusually long heat wave is intensifying and spreading up the West Coast \u2013 and there will be no relief for days. California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Arizona are bracing for potential wildfires, opening cooling centers and warning residents to stay indoors and keep hydrated as the unrelenting heat wave delivers sweltering temperatures well into the 100s and 110s \u2013 with highs in the 120s possible in the Desert Southwest. And it\u2019s only getting hotter. Death Valley, California, could top 125 degrees by Sunday or Monday, setting a new daily record for those dates. Las Vegas, Nevada, could also exceed its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees Sunday or Monday. \u201cConfidence is increasing that this potentially historic heatwave will last several days,\u201d the National Weather Service in Portland warned, adding the risk of heat-related illness will increase significantly. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service. In\u00a0San\u00a0Jose, California, a homeless man\u00a0died Tuesday due to the extreme heat, Mayor Matt Mahan said.\u00a0The man was 69, according to the mayor\u2019s spokesperson, Tasha Dean, citing information from the\u00a0Santa Clara Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. The same day, a 10-year-old died in Arizona after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, the Phoenix Police Department said. \u201cThis is a DANGEROUS situation, especially for sensitive populations,\u201d the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said, reminding residents to drink plenty of water, stay in the shade, wear light, loose fitting clothes and never leave anyone in a car. Saturday will likely be the hottest day in this prolonged heat wave. High temperatures in the 110s are becoming common across California, outside coastal areas and higher elevations, the National Weather Service said. \u201cThis level of heat throughout parts of the Mojave Desert and Sacramento/San Joaquin valleys of California could pose a risk to anyone if proper heat safety is not followed,\u201d the weather service said. Nationwide, nearly 140 million people remain under heat alerts \u2013 mostly in Western states, where the heat wave is expected to last through the middle of next week. More than 70 million people will be under heat alerts in parts of 10 western states on Saturday. Parts of Oregon will experience triple digits Friday, and the heat could last up to five days with poor overnight relief, the National Weather Service in Portland said. A state of emergency was declared in Multnomah County, Oregon\u2019s most populous county, for this weekend\u00a0as temperatures were expected to climb. \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend,\u201d Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno said in a news release. \u201cThey\u2019ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.\u201d Bruno said the area has had few hot days so far this year, and residents\u2019 bodies have not yet acclimated to the heat. A previous heat wave that scorched Oregon in 2021 left dozens of people dead. Power equipment buckled in the heat, triggering rolling blackouts for tens of thousands as temperatures soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. While this heat wave isn\u2019t expected to be as intense as the 2021 scorcher,\u00a0forecasters are concerned about its long duration, said Meteorologist Noah Alviz of the National Weather Service in Portland.\u00a0\u201cGetting into the upper 90s or even triple digits of 100 to 105 for four to five days \u2013 that is very unusual for this location,\u201d Alviz told CNN. \u201cThe triple-digit heat will expand northward into the Pacific Northwest and parts of the central Great Basin, with widespread highs rising into the 90s and low 100s,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cThe duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week.\u201d Intense heat is expected to persist for much of the West Coast into the weekend. Major to extreme heat risk, the highest two levels, are expected for much of California and the Southwest on Saturday and Sunday, meaning health effects of heat become more likely in anyone without adequate hydration or cooling. Over a dozen high-temperature records were either broken or tied on Thursday, including multiple California cities. Palmdale reached 110 degrees, and Madera hit 109 degrees. The extremely dangerous and potentially deadly heat baking parts of the US also set a few all-time record high temperatures in some locations Friday. Palm Springs, California, reached 124 degrees Friday afternoon, exceeding the previous all-time record high for the date of 123 degrees set in 2021. An all-time record high of 105 set in 2012 was also broken in Raleigh, North Carolina, where temperatures of 106 degrees were recorded Friday. Additional daily record highs set on Friday included: \u2022 114 degrees: San Jacinto, California\u2022 109 degrees:\u00a0Medford, Oregon\u2022 109 degrees: Campo, California Dozens of additional temperature records are expected to be tied or broken each of the next few days. The dangerous heat will expand into the Intermountain West and northern High Plains by next week. The stage is set for wildfire spread The extreme heat \u2013 combined with gusty winds and low humidity \u2013 means any wildfires that start will spread quickly through already parched vegetation. Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the area of the Thompson Fire, which has consumed more than 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday. The blaze, which was 55% contained by Friday afternoon local time, has forced thousands of people to evacuate and prompted more than 2,000 firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat in the Oroville area. The wildfire has injured 11 firefighters, including eight who were affected by heat-related illnesses, according to Chris Peterson, a spokesperson for the\u00a0California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection \u2013 also known as Cal Fire. Twenty-six structures have been destroyed by the blaze and more than 4,000 are under threat. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with more than 145,000 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 7,812 acres burned by this time last year, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. There are now nearly two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing fires on the coast in San Diego, to the foothills in Butte,\u201d Cal Fire Deputy Director Nick Schuler told CNN Wednesday. \u201cOur\u00a0firefighters are battling fires across California and often times on the line for more than 24 hours. It\u2019s difficult conditions that they face.\u201d A wildfire in California\u2019s Mariposa County, the French Fire, injured three firefighters and destroyed four structures, according to Cal Fire. It also triggered evacuation orders Thursday night. The fire has burned more than 900 acres just northwest of the small community of Mariposa, outside Yosemite National Park, and is 20% contained as of Friday evening. More than 800 structures are under threat. \u201cFirefighters continue to gain containment and cool hot spots throughout the fire,\u201d CAL Fire said in an update on its incident page Friday. \u201cUtility crews are working diligently to repair and replace damaged infrastructure.\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0for the area of the Thompson Fire on Wednesday. The declaration cleared the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. And in central Washington state, fireworks sparked an active wildfire called the Balsam Root Fire early Friday morning, according to Wenatchee Valley Fire Department Chief Brian Brett. The fire is burning in Wenatchee, about 150 miles east of Seattle. The fire is currently around 250 acres and is 30% contained, Brett told CNN. A Level 3 Evacuation Alert is in effect for approximately 150 homes. Residents under this advisory are being told to leave immediately. The department had previously reminded residents \u201cprivate fireworks are banned in most of Chelan and Douglas Counties.\u201d Fireworks started an estimated 31,302 fires in 2022, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Southeast to see sizzling temperatures, too As the West swelters, oppressive heat and humidity will begin to shift eastward to the mid-Atlantic and Southeast for the end of the week. \u201cWarm overnight conditions in the upper 70s and low 80s will offer little relief, leading to a dangerous situation for those without access to adequate cooling,\u201d the National Weather Service said. New heat alerts are now posted in southeast Texas, extreme southern Florida and parts of the Southeast northward to the mid-Atlantic, where high temperatures will range between 95-105 degrees. Cities including Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Raleigh and Washington, DC, will be feeling the heat. The heat index values \u2013 how air feels to the human body \u2013 will range between 100 and 115 degrees in those areas. \u201cA cold front entering the southern Plains is anticipated to offer cooler and below average temperatures to Oklahoma, much of northern/western Texas, and the Mid-South by Friday,\u201d the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/weather/west-coast-california-oregon-heat-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

CNN cannot independently verify the ministry\u2019s numbers. A displaced man at the school told CNN children were among the injured. \u201cThere was a swing here, swings were here, (children) were playing. What was their fault?\u201d he said as he held his little daughter. \u201cWe barely found this place in the school, but even the school is not safe.\u201d CNN video shows several injured children arriving at a nearby hospital following the attack. The Israeli military said in a statement on Saturday militants were operating in structures located in the school area. \u201cThis location served as a hideout and operational infrastructure from which attacks against IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops operating in the Gaza Strip were directed and carried out,\u201d the statement added. CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military\u2019s claim. UNRWA Communication Director Juliette Touma told CNN UNRWA does not have all the information yet, adding that half of UNRWA\u2019s facilities in Gaza have been hit since October 7. \u201cAt least 500 people sheltering in those (UNRWA) facilities have been killed, many were women and children,\u201d she added. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said it \u201ccondemned in the strongest terms\u201d the attack on the UNRWA building, which it said \u201chouses thousands of displaced civilians.\u201d Jordan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the strike and what it called Israel\u2019s \u201cclear disregard for the rules of international law,\u201d saying that humanitarian facilities and shelters must be protected under international law. The news comes just as it appeared some progress was being made in long-stalled hostage release and truce negotiations. A senior Hamas official told CNN the militant group was ready to reconsider its insistence that Israel commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement that would usher in a temporary truce and begin a process to release hostages. Meanwhile, the near-weekly demonstrations against the Israeli government continued on Saturday. Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv\u2019s Democracy Square to call for new elections and the release of hostages amid discontent with how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has handled issues including the war in Gaza. Israeli police said in a statement that two protesters were arrested at the Tel Aviv demonstration, citing violations of public order and unsafe behavior, including \u201clighting bonfires on the road.\u201d The police said they deployed in large forces to maintain security and order and dispersed the demonstration after protesters illegally gathered on Menachem Begin Road and tried to block it, despite initial approval for the protest. Protesters waved Israeli flags and held signs criticizing Netanyahu, while police used water cannons to disperse demonstrators blocking the traffic on the Ayalon Highway. \u201cAfter most of the protesters dispersed naturally and in light of the violations of order by a handful of protesters, the police had to declare an illegal demonstration,\u201d the police said. \u201cDuring the dispersal of the rioters, the police arrested two suspects.\u201d The Israeli police further warned that it \u201cwill act with zero tolerance towards those who disrupt the order and will not listen to the policemen\u2019s instructions.\u201d The chairman of Israel\u2019s National Unity and former war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, was seen participating in a rally calling for the return of the hostages. The often-weekly demonstrations have yet to change the political landscape, and Netanyahu still controls a stable majority in parliament. Additional reporting by Hamdi Alkhshali and Ibrahim Dahman.

{"id": "2015_07_20_travel_shark-attack-how-to-survive", "text": "First things first. Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon. But sharks do occasionally attack humans \u2013 and they certainly make news when they do: \u2022 A 14-year-old boy was bitten in the leg by a shark at a\u00a0North Carolina beach\u00a0in late June 2024. \u2022 A lifeguard and surf instructor, who also appeared in \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,\u201d died after an apparent\u00a0shark\u00a0attack on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii, in late June 2024. \u2022 Florida fire officials asked beachgoers to exercise caution in early June 2024 after three people were injured in two separate shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other at neighboring Walton County beaches. \u2022 A Russian citizen was killed by a shark in the Red Sea in Egypt on June 2023. While these kinds of encounters understandably cause would-be ocean swimmers to worry, there\u2019s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines. The Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s International Shark Attack File found just 69 confirmed, unprovoked shark attacks on people and 36 confirmed bites worldwide in 2023. That compares with 57 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 32 bites in 2022. Think about it a minute \u2013 the world population is more than 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And that\u2019s all the shark attacks recorded. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher. In 2023, the United States once again led the way in unprovoked attacks in 2023 at 36; Florida had the highest state total at 16. That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel. Before you get in the water Know your environment Sharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,\u201d said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.  \u201cFortunately, humans aren\u2019t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.\u201d Still, there are places you\u2019re more likely to encounter a shark.  River mouths are not the best place to swim You should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.  Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks. \u201cAn awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river \u2013 people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,\u201d said Peirce. Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out. Avoid areas with fishing Before you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says \u201cforget it.\u201d \u201cWhether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,\u201d he said.   Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That\u2019s a possible sign a shark might be nearby. He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore. Avoid dusk and dawn Swimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it\u2019s also the time when a shark attack is most likely. \u201cA lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,\u201d Peirce says, \u201cdue to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.\u201d Hang with lifeguards Chris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to \u201cdo your homework\u201d before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places. If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.  \u201cI always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It\u2019s a lot safer,\u201d he said. Don\u2019t wear shiny objects in the water \u201cBe careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.\u201d Lowe said. In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.\u201d Follow your instincts \u201cProbably the most important thing is to follow your gut,\u201d Hammerschlag said. \u201cIf you feel wary about getting in the water \u2026 just don\u2019t go in the water.\u201d \u201cA lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn\u2019t listen to it,\u201d he said. If a shark is nearby Don\u2019t panic So you\u2019re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic. \u201cDon\u2019t start splashing around \u2013 you\u2019re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark\u2019s interest,\u201d said Peirce. Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose. \u201cA shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it\u2019s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we often get exploratory bites which don\u2019t result in death and sometimes don\u2019t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you\u2019re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.\u201d Maintain eye contact As the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact. \u201cSharks are ambush predators,\u201d Peirce explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it\u2019s not going to be half as comfortable as if it\u2019s able to sneak up from behind.\u201d Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you\u2019re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore. If you\u2019re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. \u201cLet the shark know it\u2019s being watched.\u201d Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,\u201d Fragola says in the video. Stay big or get small This is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.  \u201cThe bigger you are in the water, the more respect you\u2019ll get,\u201d he said. But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce\u2019s advice is to roll up into a ball. \u201cIf a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor \u2013 and if it wasn\u2019t showing massive interest in me \u2013 I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.\u201d If you\u2019re being attacked Don\u2019t play dead This isn\u2019t a bear, it\u2019s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots \u2013 but be careful where you aim. \u201cThere\u2019s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That\u2019s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThis is a moving object in the water and you\u2019re not staying still either, so what you don\u2019t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.\u201d A good shot to the gills can also do the job: \u201cThe gills are very sensitive \u2013 giving a shark a whack in the gills isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201d Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you\u2019re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,\u201d Peirce says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it\u2019s (been) enough to use a shark billy \u2013 a small metal rod between two and three feet long \u2013 and I\u2019ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.\u201d It\u2019s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you\u2019ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten. Cut off the angles If you\u2019re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can\u2019t get behind you, says Peirce. \u201cKeep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you\u2019ve only got one direction to look. You\u2019re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.\u201d Slowly back away Displace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore. \u201cYou must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you\u2019ve got to be careful \u2013 large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.\u201d Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim. \u201cIf a white shark is in full attack mode, there\u2019s not much you\u2019re going to be able to do at that point,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2015/07/20/travel/shark-attack-how-to-survive/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

No discriminatory behavior of any kind has a place in French rugby.\u201d Jaminet, who came off the bench in France\u2019s 28-13 victory over Argentina in Mendoza on Saturday, released an apology via his Instagram story. \u201cI am deeply sorry and ashamed of my words. I want to apologize to everyone. I understand that this may have hurt and offended many people, and I want to make it clear that these remarks in no way reflect my values or those of the French Rugby team,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRacism in all its forms is unacceptable and goes against everything I believe in. I understand the sanction from the FFR and am available to them to shed light on this matter.\u201d CNN has reached out to Jaminet for comment. At club level, Jaminet plays for Toulon in France. Toulon said it \u201ccondemns\u201d Jaminet\u2019s comments and \u201cdisassociates itself from them\u201d in a post on X. The team added it has also opened an investigation into the matter.

{"id": "2024_07_08_travel_barcelona-tourism-protests-scli-intl", "text": "Protesters in Barcelona have sprayed visitors with water as part of a demonstration against mass tourism. Demonstrators marching through areas popular with tourists on Saturday chanted \u201ctourists go home\u201d and squirted them with water pistols, while others carried signs with slogans including \u201cBarcelona is not for sale.\u201d Thousands of protesters took to the streets of the city in the latest demonstration against mass tourism in Spain, which has seen similar actions in the Canary Islands and Mallorca recently, decrying the impact on living costs and quality of life for local people. The demonstration was organised by a group of more than 100 local organizations, led by the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turi\u0301stic (Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth). According to official figures, almost 26 million visitors made an overnight stay in the Barcelona region in 2023, spending \u20ac12.75 billion ($13.8 billion). However, the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Tur\u00edstic says that these visitors increase prices and put pressure on public services, while profits from the tourism industry are unfairly distributed and increase social inequality. It has published 13 proposals to reduce the number of visitors and transition the city to a new model of tourism, including the closure of cruise ship terminals, more regulation of tourist accommodation and an end to public spending on tourism promotion. On Saturday, the city\u2019s mayor, Jaume Collboni, highlighted a series of measures that he has announced recently to reduce the impact of mass tourism, including increasing the nightly tourist tax to \u20ac4 ($4.30) and limiting the number of cruise ship passengers. At the end of June, Collboni also announced that it would end apartment rentals for tourists by 2028 by scrapping short-term rental licenses for more than 10,000 apartments. This would help to make housing more affordable for long-term residents, according to Collboni, who said rents had increased 68% in the past 10 years, with the cost of buying a house up 38%. However, Collboni has been criticized for allowing events such as a Louis Vuitton catwalk show in architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s Parc G\u00fcell in May, as well as the upcoming America\u2019s Cup sailing competition. The growing discontent in Barcelona echoes similar protests in other parts of Spain. In April, locals in the\u00a0Canary Islands\u00a0mobilized to protest against\u00a0excessive tourism, blaming visitors for pricing them out of their homes and causing environmental damage. These complaints are common to many tourist hot spots around the world, which have experienced record visitor numbers recently as the travel industry has roared back from a pandemic-induced downturn. Such surges may be sweet for local economies and hospitality businesses\u2019 bottom line, but they also come with notable downsides: increased noise, pollution, traffic and strain on resources; a lower quality of life for locals; and a diminished visitor experience, among others. Not surprisingly, many tourist magnets have created initiatives and restrictions intended to combat overtourism, including new or increased tourist taxes, campaigns aimed at discouraging problematic visitors and attendance caps at popular attractions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/travel/barcelona-tourism-protests-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

After an impressive 6-2 6-1 win, an emotional Svitolina struggled to get through her on-court interview after the match. The 29-year-old received a rousing round of applause from the crowd on Court 2 as she tried to compose herself. \u201cIt was a good performance from my side today and it\u2019s a very difficult day today for Ukrainian people,\u201d Svitolina said while fighting back tears. \u201cSo it was not easy to focus on the match today and since the morning it\u2019s very difficult to read the news and just to go onto the court is extremely tough, so I\u2019m happy that I could play today and get a win. \u201cThank you for the support.\u201d Svitolina, the No. 21 seed at Wimbledon, was utterly dominant in her win over Wang and needed just 55 minutes to book her place in the quarterfinals. A semifinalist at Wimbledon last year, Svitolina hit 21 winners - including eight aces - and made just 10 unforced errors against her Chinese opponent, ranked 42nd in the world. A ruthless Svitolina converted four of her six break point chances and she will now face 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina on Wednesday for a place in the semifinals. Rybakina, the No. 4 seed, was involved a hard-fought contest earlier on Wednesday until opponent Anna Kalinskaya had to retire in the second set due to a wrist injury. At least 36 people were killed across Ukraine in Russian attacks on Monday, Ukrainian authorities said. Kyiv\u2019s Okhmatdyt hospital has been crucial in supporting some the sickest children from across the country. Two adults were killed and 16 others \u2013 including seven children \u2013 were\u00a0injured in the attack, according to Kyiv\u2019s mayor Vitaliy Klytchko Some 137 people were wounded in the attacks which left nearly 100 buildings damaged.

{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_uk-election-labour-win-gbr-intl", "text": "The Labour Party has won a landslide victory in the UK general election, sweeping into power after 14 years of Conservative rule on the back of a wave of public disillusionment. Party leader Keir Starmer took over as prime minister on Friday after King Charles III formally asked him to form a new government, with the politician promising the British public he would steer the country towards \u201ccalmer waters.\u201d Starmer, 61, begins his term with what is one of the biggest parliamentary majorities in British history and is expected to introduce a program of far-reaching reforms. Addressing the nation from outside 10 Downing Street for the first time as prime minister, Starmer had one overarching message: Change starts now. \u201cIt is surely clear to everyone that our country needs a bigger reset, a rediscovery of who we are,\u201d he said, cautioning that the national renewal he was promising would take time. \u201cChanging a country is not like flipping a switch, the world is now a more volatile place,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party recorded the worst result in its history, prompting some commentators to observe that the overall election result was as much about British voters booting out the Conservatives as voting in Labour. The party lost more than 250 of the seats it had held in the 650-seat Parliament since 2019. \u00a0There were high-profile casualties, with the short-lived former Prime Minister Liz Truss and several cabinet ministers being booted out by voters. Conservative leader and, as of Friday morning, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took responsibility for the electoral wipeout, apologizing to voters in his farewell address. \u201cI have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change; and yours is the only judgment that matters,\u201d he said on the doorstep of the famous 10 Downing Street residence. Sunak announced he would resign as the leader of the Conservative Party as soon as arrangements were made to find his successor. \u201cI have heard your anger, your disappointment. And I take responsibility for this loss,\u201d he told voters as his wife Akshata Murty stood by. The handover of power is a swift \u2013 and sometimes brutal \u2013 process in the UK, with the outgoing prime minister replaced within hours of losing the election. In keeping with tradition, Sunak left Downing Street for the last time immediately after his speech and was driven the short distance to\u00a0Buckingham Palace to meet the King and hand in his resignation. Having conceded the election in the early hours of Friday, Sunak was out of the job by midday. An hour or so later, election winner Starmer arrived for a brief audience with the King. Leaving the palace as the newly minted prime minister, he then headed straight to Downing Street. The two politicians paid respectful tribute to each other, even though they did not meet in person on Friday. Sunak called his successor \u201ca decent, public-spirited man who I respect\u201d on his way out, while Starmer praised his predecessor\u2019s \u201cdedication and hard work\u201d and highlighted the significance of him being the first British Asian prime minister. Many winners, as many losers While the night was marked by a seismic shift in power from the Conservatives to Labour, other parties scored big wins. The Liberal Democrats went from winning just 11 seats at the 2019 general election to securing more than 70. Traditionally the third-biggest party across the UK, the Lib Dems have in the past struggled to break through and convert their relatively high vote share into parliamentary seats because of the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system, which favors the biggest parties. Reform UK, the insurgent rightwing populist party, won roughly 14% of the vote but took only five seats in parliament, having split the rightwing vote in many places and further hurt the Conservatives. The grouping is led by Nigel Farage, the face of the Brexit movement and an ally of former US President Donald Trump. Farage himself was elected a member of parliament (MP) for the first time \u2013 after running unsuccessfully seven times in the past. It was a good night too for the Green Party. While the party stood candidates in a record number of constituencies in this election, its official goal was to win four seats - and it succeeded in all four, managing to take two seats from the Conservatives. Meanwhile, the Scottish National Party, or SNP, had a disastrous night, suffering a near total wipeout and ending up with just nine seats, compared to 47 previously. While that defeat might put the push for an independent Scotland on the backburner for now, in Northern Ireland the Irish nationalist Sinn F\u00e9in became the biggest party, overtaking the Democratic Unionist Party, or DUP. Sinn F\u00e9in advocates for a united Ireland and boycotts the UK Parliament, traditionally abstaining from Westminster politics. The DUP, meanwhile, wants a tighter relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Turnout nationwide was low, at just below 60% - only the second time in the past century that more than 40% of voters decided to stay home. And although Labour won by a landslide in terms of seats in parliament, the popular vote showed the party\u2019s win was not a resounding victory. Labour only increased its vote share by a few percentage points from its dismal 2019 showing. Government-building and soul searching Starmer began to form his government on Friday, promising the public he would start working immediately. He appointed Rachel Reeves as the UK\u2019s first female treasury chief and his long-time deputy party leader Angela Rayner as his deputy PM. The new cabinet is expected to mirror Starmer\u2019s former shadow government, although some Labour MPs might see their roles diminished following a poorer than expected showing in their individual constituencies.\u00a0\u00a0Starmer also named David Lammy as Foreign Secretary and Yvette Cooper as Home Secretary. The new prime minister begins his tenure with a strong personal mandate. The huge Labour victory is seen by many as his personal success. His rise to the top job caps what has been a remarkable, and swift, transformation of the Labour Party since the last general election in 2019, when it suffered its worst loss in a generation under its former hard-left leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who, in another twist was re-elected as an independent after being expelled from Labour. Starmer has moved the party back toward the center, promising sustainable public finances, no increases in income taxes and a green agenda. Labour\u2019s tally ended up just shy of the record-breaking majority secured by Tony Blair in 1997. The party\u2019s stance on the war in Gaza may have been a factor, as might weeks of opinion polls predicting a massive Labour win, which may have impacted turnout. Several pro-Palestinian independent candidates took seats that were expected to fall into Labour hands. Starmer \u2013 a former human rights lawyer \u2013 said shortly after the October 7 attacks by Hamas that Israel \u201chas the right\u201d to withhold power and water from Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but added: \u201cObviously, everything should be done within international law.\u201d The party has since become increasingly critical of Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza and now supports a ceasefire, along with the return of hostages held by Hamas. Meanwhile, the Tories, as the Conservatives are often referred to in the UK, must now endeavor to figure out where it all went so terribly wrong. The party has likely paid a price for what are widely seen as years of chaos and a worsening standard of living under its watch. A notable trigger for that turmoil was the decision by the then Prime Minister David Cameron to call a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. What started out as Cameron\u2019s attempt to shut down the Euroskeptic opposition within his own party brought on years of uncertainty and infighting followed by Brexit \u2013 while many voters still support the country\u2019s departure from the EU, it has caused Britons to be worse off than they used to be. The Brexit debacle was followed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its handling in Britain was marked by a series of scandals involving top government officials, including Sunak and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who were fined for breaching the same rules they had imposed on citizens. A cost-of-living crisis that hit much of Europe and the United States, exacerbated by energy prices sent soaring by the war in Ukraine, was made worse in the UK by the Truss government\u2019s disastrous tax-cutting gamble, which caused a political and economic meltdown and sent the cost of borrowing skyrocketing. But with turnout plunging to the lowest level in decades, one thing is certain: like elsewhere in the world, many people in the United Kingdom have become disillusioned with politics, losing their hope for a better future. It will be up to Keir Starmer to convince them otherwise \u2013 a tough job given the sluggish economy, war in Ukraine and the Middle East and the unfolding climate crisis.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/uk-election-labour-win-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

The report from the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) confirmed the authenticity of a June 30 video statement by 16 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) leaders announcing they were dissolving the extremist network. In the statement, captured on video and shared online, the leaders confirmed their commitment to the Indonesian state and law, and said all material taught in JI-affiliated boarding schools would be in line with orthodox Islam. \u201cIt is too early to say what the consequences are, but the men who signed the statement have enough respect and credibility within the organisation to ensure widespread acceptance,\u201d said Sidney Jones, who authored IPAC\u2019s preliminary analysis. The Al-Qaeda-linked militant group is accused of orchestrating some of the deadliest attacks in Indonesia, including the 2002 bombing of Bali nightclubs that killed more than 200 people. Indonesia\u2019s National Counter Terrorism Agency (BNPT) declined to comment on the development, but said it planned to hold a press conference soon. The decision to disband the organization, said Jones, was likely driven by several factors, including the influence of intellectuals within JI who were less interested in violent jihad, and a cost-benefit analysis on the best way to protect the group\u2019s biggest assets \u2013 its schools. Intensive engagement with counter-terrorism officials also played a role, the report said. Despite the clout of the figures involved, IPAC noted the group has a history of splinters and it was possible one could emerge in the future, although probably not immediately. \u201cFor the moment, the likely result is the flourishing of JI-affiliated schools and the increasing involvement in public life of the men who signed the 30 June statement,\u201d said IPAC. \u201cWhat happens to the rest of the membership remains to be seen.\u201d Adhe Bhakti, a terrorism expert at the Jakarta-based Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, said he doubted the group\u2019s splinter factions would follow their seniors. He said these groups could become threats because they will feel they need \u201cto do something violently,\u201d although he did not believe this will happen in the near future. \u201cThe splinters have in fact become wild at this vulnerable point,\u201d Adhe said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/asia/jemaah-islamiyah-militant-group-disbanded-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_france-election-second-round-result-intl", "text": "A left-wing alliance has won the most seats in the French parliament after tactical voting in Sunday\u2019s second round election thwarted Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party, but France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority. In a surprise result, the New Popular Front (NFP) \u2013 a cluster of several parties ranging from the far-left France Unbowed party to the more moderate Socialists and the Ecologists \u2013 won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group but short of the 289 required for an absolute majority, according to the French Interior Ministry. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which had slumped to a dismal third in the first round of voting last Sunday, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. Despite leading after the first round of votes, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party and its allies won 143 seats. The RN\u2019s strong showing in the first round stirred fears that France could be on the cusp of electing its first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But Sunday\u2019s results come as a huge upset and show French voters\u2019 overwhelming desire to keep the far right from gaining power \u2013 even at the cost of a hung parliament. After the first round, an unprecedented number of seats \u2013 over 300 \u2013 went to a three-way runoff between Ensemble, the NFP and the RN. By Tuesday, more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates withdrew from the second round, in a bid to avoid splitting the vote. Cheers rang out on the streets of Paris as the projection was published. Speaking to a crowd of his ecstatic supporters near Stalingrad square, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the firebrand leader of France Unbowed, said the results came as a \u201chuge relief for the overwhelming majority of people in our country.\u201d \u201cOur people have clearly rejected the worst-case scenario,\u201d M\u00e9lenchon said. \u201cA magnificent surge of civic mobilization has taken hold!\u201d Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege, announced he would resign as prime minister Monday morning. He seemed to take a swipe at Macron\u2019s decision to call the snap vote, saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t choose\u201d for France\u2019s parliament to be dissolved. Elsewhere in Paris, the buoyant atmosphere at a RN campaign event in Bois de Vincennes took a nosedive an hour before the polls closed. After the projection was announced, Jordan Bardella, the party\u2019s 28-year-old leader, said France had been thrown into \u201cuncertainty and instability.\u201d Handpicked as leader by Marine Le Pen in an effort to purge the party of its racist and antisemitic roots, Bardella had taken the party closer to the gates of power than ever before. Visibly disappointed by the results, he slammed the NFP as an \u201calliance of dishonor.\u201d \u201cAs from tomorrow, our deputies will take up their places to make sure we counter the migration policies and other policies of the far left. We will not enter into any kind of coalition or compromise, we will be the side of the French people,\u201d he said. A hastily assembled coalition In a brief statement, the Elysee said Macron is awaiting the full results of all 577 constituencies \u201cbefore taking the necessary decisions.\u201d \u201cIn his role as guarantor of our institutions, the president will ensure that the sovereign choice of the French people is respected,\u201d it said. After parliamentary elections, the French president appoints a prime minister from the party that won the most seats. Ordinarily, this means a candidate from the president\u2019s own party. However, Sunday\u2019s results mean Macron faces the prospect of having to appoint a figure from the left-wing coalition, in a rare arrangement known as a \u201ccohabitation.\u201d Speaking to supporters near Stalingrad square, M\u00e9lenchon said Macron \u201chas the duty to call the New Popular Front to govern.\u201d But it is not clear from which party within the coalition that Macron will appoint a prime minister. France Unbowed won 74 seats, making it the largest single party within the NFP, ahead of the Socialists with 59. But Macron and his allies had repeatedly stressed that they would refuse to enter into coalition with M\u00e9lenchon. Speaking after last Sunday\u2019s first round, outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal \u2013 Macron\u2019s protege, said France Unbowed was preventing the formation of a \u201ccredible alternative\u201d to the far right. The NFP formed less than a month ago, after Macron called the snap vote following his party\u2019s disastrous loss to the RN in last month\u2019s European Parliament election. The capacious \u2013 and potentially fractious \u2013 coalition chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. Sunday\u2019s results mean the NFP has managed to do this again. It campaigned on a platform to raise the minimum monthly wage to 1,600 euros (more than $1,700), to cap the price of essential foods, electricity, fuel and gas, and to scrap Macron\u2019s deeply unpopular pension reform, which raised the French retirement age \u2013 already one of the lowest in the Western world \u2013 from 62 to 64. A mess of Macron\u2019s making? Sunday\u2019s vote represents a victory for the French \u201ccordon sanitaire,\u201d the principle that mainstream parties must unite to block the far right from taking office. But the RN\u2019s success should not be underestimated. In the 2017 elections, when Macron swept to power, the RN won just eight seats. In 2022, it surged to 89 seats. In Sunday\u2019s vote, it won 125 \u2013 making it the largest individual party in parliament. While the risk of a far-right government has been avoided for now, these elections have plunged France into political uncertainty. Macron called the election three years earlier than necessary, just minutes after his party was trounced by the far right in the EU election. Although EU election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. But Sunday\u2019s results may further muddy the French political picture. Unable to call a new election for at least another year, and with three years left on his presidential term, Macron looks set to preside over an unruly parliament, as problems mount at home and abroad. \u00c9douard Philippe, France\u2019s former prime minister and an ally of Macron, said Macron\u2019s gamble had further complicated the situation. \u201cThe truth is that none of the political blocs in the assembly has a majority on its own to govern. The dissolution of the assembly, which was intended as a clarification, has instead led to great vagueness,\u201d he said Sunday evening. \u201cThe central political forces therefore have a responsibility to stay. They must, without compromise, promote the creation of an agreement that will stabilize the political situation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-election-second-round-result-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

The change in Hamas\u2019 position was first reported by Reuters, and comes amid intensified efforts towards reaching an agreement.\u00a0The group has long demanded Israel agree to a permanent ceasefire before signing any deal, terms Israel sees as unacceptable. The apparent willingness to compromise raises the possibility a deal could be reached. Hamas would instead accept that talks on reaching a permanent ceasefire would take place throughout the first phase of any deal, which would last six weeks, the official told CNN. The Hamas official \u2013 who is a member of the negotiating team \u2013 confirmed to CNN that mediators would guarantee a temporary truce, the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops so long as indirect talks continued on implementing the second phase of the agreement. The Hamas official, who declined to be named, said Hamas accepted a proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli men and soldiers held in Gaza no later than 16 days after the first phase of the agreement begins to be implemented. Israeli media previously reported that a draft Israeli plan laid out\u00a0terms for a similar agreement. The draft stipulates that \u201cno later than the 16th day, indirect negotiations will begin between the two parties to conclude the conditions for the implementation of phase 2 of this agreement. The negotiations should be completed before the end of the 5th week of the first phase.\u201d The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) has not confirmed the authenticity of that draft. Indirect negotiations between an Israeli team and Hamas resumed in Qatar this week after Prime Minister Netanyahu authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations to try and broker a deal. Mossad director David Barea was in Qatar\u00a0to meet with the mediators and discuss the details of a potential new framework agreement for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Upon his return, the PMO issued a statement saying \u201cthere are still gaps\u201d between the parties. Efforts to reach a deal between Hamas and Israel have stalled for months. Netanyahu \u2013 who faces competing pressure from far-right cabinet ministers and family members of hostages to secure their release - has said Israel won\u2019t stop fighting until Hamas is destroyed. A three-phase Israeli proposal was unveiled by US President Joe Biden in May, setting conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following Hamas\u2019s October 7 attacks, which left around 1,200 dead.

Starmer\u2019s victory, with a three-figure majority in parliament, is all the more remarkable considering the journey that Labour has been on since the last general election in 2019. Then, the party suffered its worst loss in a generation under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who stood on a hard-left platform. A path back to credibility and even being competitive in a general election looked potentially a decade off, as the Conservatives emerged triumphant from the carnage of Brexit under the charismatic leadership of Boris Johnson. Johnson not only defeated his political rivals, but completely upended the norms of British politics. Under his leadership, his party won seats in traditional working-class Labour areas once deemed out of reach to Conservatives. For a year at least,\u00a0he seemed untouchable. It was in this context that Starmer took control of a broken Labour Party on April 4, 2020. On that day, David Lammy, one of his Labour colleagues, took him to one side and warned Starmer: \u201cSet yourself a 10-year cycle. You might just lose the next election, and then you can go again.\u201d According to Lammy, Starmer smiled and said \u201cNo, I can do this in five.\u201d Even Starmer could not have predicted what would happen between the end of 2021 and Thursday night. The Conservatives succumbed to repeated self-inflicted wounds, beginning with the \u201cpartygate\u201d scandal, when Downing Street staff held illegal gatherings while the rest of the country was under strict Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns. Johnson would cling to power until the summer of 2022 despite what seemed like daily calls to resign. His successor Liz Truss would propose unfunded tax cuts that threw the economy into turmoil and forced her to resign after just 49 days in power. Rishi Sunak would replace her at the end of 2022, but by that point, most in the Conservative Party had accepted it was over. During that time, Starmer stood his ground and dragged Labour firmly into the center ground of British politics with moderate policies designed not to spook Conservative voters. Critics within his party say that he has not offered an exciting enough program for government. They fear that Starmer\u2019s moderate policies of fiscal responsibility and mild manners won\u2019t enthuse voters and that five years from now, at the time of the next election, he could fall foul of a right-wing populist surge. Their fears might not be unfounded: one of the main sub-plots of the night was the surge of the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by the only Brexiteer more famous than Johnson and noted friend of Donald Trump, Nigel Farage. There has for months been a working assumption that a Starmer victory would be in part thanks to a general disdain for the Conservatives after 14 years in power. Farage\u2019s return to frontline politics during the election campaign meant that the right-wing vote would split further, helping Starmer come through the middle in key seats and secure an even more comfortable majority. In other words, Starmer\u2019s victory might not immediately mean public support for him personally or any great enthusiasm for Labour\u2019s legislative agenda. That could become a problem once he gets his feet under the desk. It has been clear for a long time that the public wanted change more than anything else. For all these reasons, it is reasonable to say that this win is not without its caveats. The populist threat is real, the Conservative Party is far from crushed and Labour\u2019s majority is not as large as some polls had predicted in the days before the election. Starmer will not be worrying too much about this for now. He is heading for a parliamentary majority so large that he will be able to push through his agenda with ease, and he will have the full mechanics of the state to help him govern. It is a level of power that seemed out of reach for any Labour leader, least of all a boring lawyer, not so long ago. And after 14 years in the wilderness, that will be enough for many in Labour for now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/labours-landslide-victory-is-a-personal-triumph-for-keir-starmer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

The drone attack took place in a settlement in the Podgorensky district, Voronezh governor Aleksandr Gusev said Sunday. Ukrainian sources said the warehouse was targeted because it was being used to supply ammunition to Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. \u201cSeveral UAVs were detected and destroyed by on-duty air defense forces over the territory of the Voronezh region last night. A fire broke out at a warehouse due to the fall of their wreckage. Detonation of explosive items began in the Podgorensky district,\u201d Gusev said.

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_sport_emma-navarro-wimbledon-us-tennis-spt-intl", "text": "The US already boasts a promising roster of young tennis stars but there is a new name on the scene. Emma Navarro is quickly establishing herself as a force to be reckoned with on the senior tour, with the 23-year-old reaching the quarterfinals at this year\u2019s Wimbledon. As if to underline her credentials, Navarro beat reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff in straight sets \u2013 6-4 6-3 \u2013 in the fourth round on Sunday to continue her best run at a grand slam. \u201cI don\u2019t have a ton of words but just really grateful to be out here on Center Court at a tournament with so much history and tradition, that so many legends have played on before me,\u201d Navarro said during her post-match interview after beating Gauff. \u201cIt\u2019s a real honor. I can\u2019t wait to play again.\u201d Navarro\u2019s form at this year\u2019s Wimbledon follows what has already been an impressive season for the youngster. The American reached the third round of the Australian Open earlier this year, before progressing to the fourth round at the French Open. According to the WTA, she has won 33 tour-level matches in 2024, more than twice as many as she won last year, while $1,074,546 of her $1,847,241 in career prize money has been won in 2024 alone. She claimed her first WTA title at the Hobart International in January and has risen from 149th in the world at the start of last season to her current position as world No. 17, \u201cI think that mindset has definitely helped me just not to look at a day like today as any different than any other match,\u201d she said, per WTA, explaining her rise after reaching the quarterfinals.  \u201cI think just being able to look at individual matches for what they are and not make them anything greater than that.\u201d While her rise through the ranks has been rapid, it perhaps shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Navarro enjoyed a successful college career at Virginia, becoming the 2021 NCAA champion in her freshman year \u2013 a result which then qualified her for the US Open main draw, where she lost in the first round. She decided to turn her full attention to professional tennis in 2022, finishing her college career with a record of 51-3 in singles matches. Billionaire heiress Just like compatriot Jessica Pegula, Navarro is the daughter of a billionaire. Her father Ben Navarro is founder and CEO of Sherman Financial Group and is valued by Forbes as being worth $1.5 billion. He has also invested heavily in tennis. In 2022, he paid nearly $300 million to buy the Cincinnati Open \u2013 a warmup event for the US Open every year. In an interview with the Tennis Channel earlier this season, Navarro credited her calm demeanour and mindset to her dad. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the smartest guy I know and he\u2019s dropped a lot of knowledge and wisdom on my siblings and I over the years,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s taught me a bunch about the perspective I want to take into things, especially on-court stuff.\u201d Despite being set to inherit a fortune, Navarro looks determined to make her own name and has a chance to do exactly that at this year\u2019s Wimbledon. She will next face Italian Jasmine Paolini on Tuesday for a place in the semifinals.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/sport/emma-navarro-wimbledon-us-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_asia_china-monster-coast-guard-ship-philippines-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China anchored one of its two \u201cmonster\u201d coast guard ships inside the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone (EEZ) last week in what a Philippine official called an act of \u201cintimidation\u201d in the ongoing territorial dispute between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea. Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the China Coast Guard vessel CCG-5901 anchored near Sabina Shoal in the Spratly Islands, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of the Philippine island of Palawan on July 3, well within Manila\u2019s 230-mile EEZ. Displacing 12,000 tons and with a length of 541 feet, CCG-5901 is three times the size of the United States Coast Guard\u2019s main patrol vessels, the National Security Cutters - leading many observers to refer to the Chinese vessel as \u201cThe Monster.\u201d While at Sabina Shoal, the Chinese ship anchored within 800 yards of one of the Philippine Coast Guard\u2019s newest and biggest ships previously deployed to the area, Tarriela said in a post on X. CCG-5901 is more than five times the size of the Philippine ship, the BRP Teresa Magbanua. \u201cIt\u2019s an intimidation on the part of the China Coast Guard,\u201d Tarriela said during a forum on Saturday, according to a Reuters report. But he said the Philippines would not back down on its South China Sea claims. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pull out, and we\u2019re not going to be intimidated,\u201d Tarriela added. When asked the Philippine claims during a regular press briefing Monday, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the area in question was part of the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone. \u201cChina\u2019s military and police ships patrolling and enforcing the law in the waters near Xianbin Jiao are in compliance with China\u2019s domestic law and international law,\u201d spokesperson Lin Jian said, using the Chinese term for the Sabina Shoal. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. A clash near Second Thomas Shoal in June saw Chinese coast guard officers\u00a0brandishing an axe\u00a0and other bladed or pointed tools at Filipino soldiers and\u00a0slashing\u00a0their rubber boat. A Filipino soldier lost a thumb during the confrontation. CCG-5901 wasn\u2019t involved in that incident but has been prowling areas of the Philippines\u2019 EEZ since, according to Ray Powell, a South China Sea expert and director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University. \u201cImmediately following the dramatic standoff at Second Thomas Shoal \u2026 The Monster toured nearly every Philippine outpost and key feature in the South China Sea,\u201d Powell said. Powell and other analysts say intimidation is one of the main jobs of the CCG-5901, which is larger than any regular coast guard ship in the world (a specialty US Coast Guard icebreaker is bigger) and even outsizes US Navy destroyers. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers displace 9,700 tons or less and are about 35 feet shorter than CCG-5901. The US Coast Guard\u2019s National Security Cutters, displace 4,500 tons, a third of the size of CCG-5901. In a firepower comparison, CCG-5901 also betters the US cutters, with two main 76.2-millimeters guns compared to one main 57-millimeter gun on the US ships. \u201cIts massive size enables it to intimidate its neighbors while avoiding the escalatory implications of sending a gray-hulled military vessel,\u201d Powell said, referring to navy ships. Coast guards, known as white-hulled vessels because of their color, are usually assigned to law enforcement and search-and-rescue operations. In most countries, they are not normally expected to participate in military operations. The US Coast Guard, for instance, is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, not the Defense Department, although US Coast Guard vessels can come under US Navy control in certain scenarios. The China Coast Guard is part of the country\u2019s People\u2019s Armed Police, which is under the command of the Central Military Commission. Analysts say that\u2019s a key difference between the two coast guard agencies. \u201cIt is not really intended to carry out traditional coast guard missions, but is primarily used as a central element in China\u2019s paramilitary maritime force,\u201d Powell said of \u201cThe Monster.\u201d Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center, said CCG-5901\u2019s size and crew enable it to be a central command ship for a larger operation. He noted that a Chinese navy aircraft carrier was also operating near the Philippines in recent weeks and that the combination of the two is a coordinated effort to demonstrate overwhelming Chinese naval power to Manila. China has both the world\u2019s largest navy, in terms of sheer ship numbers, as well as the world\u2019s largest coast guard. Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said \u201cThe Monster\u201d shows the Chinese military\u2019s ability for \u201cescalation dominance,\u201d adding that the vessel the Philippines had previously sent to Sabina Shoal, the Teresa Magbanua, was one of its best. The China Coast Guard \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be outdone thus this monster came along to show who\u2019s got a bigger set of muscles,\u201d Koh said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/asia/china-monster-coast-guard-ship-philippines-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-talks-hamas-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations to try and broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, an Israeli official and a source familiar with the negotiations said. The decision signals that Israel and Hamas are entering a new phase of negotiations that could produce a final deal within a matter of weeks, if successful. Israel and Hamas on Thursday both appeared inclined to underplay the latest developments in written statements, with people involved in the talks expressing cautious optimism. For months, Israel and Hamas have engaged in mediated negotiations focused on trying to reach a framework agreement, intentionally leaving key details \u2014 such as the identity of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for hostages \u2014 \u00a0aside as they worked to hammer out a framework. The breakthrough in the talks came earlier this week after the United States proposed new language for two key clauses (8 and 14) focused on the scope and sequencing of negotiations set to take place during the first phase of the agreement in order to unlock the second phase of the deal. Hamas broadly agreed with the new language, unlocking detailed negotiations following Netanyahu\u2019s approval. Mossad Director David Barnea, who has led Israel\u2019s negotiating team, is set to lead the negotiating delegation for the new round of detailed talks, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said. Talks are expected to be held in Doha, Qatar, starting as early as Friday, according to a senior Biden administration official. The Mossad director is expected to meet with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani for discussions aiming to bring the parties closer to a deal in Gaza, according to a source with knowledge of the talks. Those negotiations are expected to last two to three weeks, the Israeli source said, to resolve issues such as the identities of Palestinian prisoners to be released, the exact ratio of prisoners to hostages and the technical sequencing of the releases. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau,\u00a0told CNN,\u00a0\u201cthere is nothing official about an effective agreement for ceasefire. The enemy\u2019s media are talking about sending a delegation to Egypt,\u00a0but there is nothing official or any details. Negotiations did not start yet.\u201d \u201cWe are also waiting for a positive response from the Israeli side, which will initiate negotiations into details of the deal,\u201d Naim added. \u201cWe have no information about any delegation visiting Cairo.\u201d Netanyahu spoke Thursday with US President Joe Biden to discuss the progress in the negotiations and the Israeli Cabinet was set to meet Thursday evening. The call focused on the details of the hostage and ceasefire deal, the senior Biden administration official said, adding that there seems to be a \u201cpretty significant opening\u201d for the hostage deal to be agreed upon by all the involved groups.

{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_ukraine-russian-strike-childrens-hospital-intl", "text": "A Russian missile strike partially destroyed a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv on Monday, causing terrified patients and their families to flee for their lives, as officials fear more people could be trapped beneath the rubble. Moscow launched a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across Ukraine during morning rush hour, killing at least 37 people and injuring 170 others, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The large scale bombardment struck areas in the capital, as well as in Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. The death toll includes 27 people killed, including three children, in the capital, the Kyiv city military administration said Monday. Two people were killed and at least 16 were injured in the strike on Kyiv\u2019s Okhmatdyt hospital. The facility is Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s medical center and has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country. Every year, around 7,000 surgeries \u2013 including treatments for cancer and hematological diseases \u2013 are conducted at the hospital, according to Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman\u00a0Dmytro Lubinets. Videos from the scene of the children\u2019s hospital showed volunteers working with police and security services to sift through the rubble as smoke billowed from the hospital, as staff described how they tried to rush children to safety in the wake of the attack. Ukraine\u2019s health minister Viktor Liashko said intensive care units, oncology departments and surgery units had been damaged. More than 600 patients were evacuated from the hospital, with more than 100 transferred to other healthcare facilities, Liashko said, according to state news agency Ukrinform. \u201cThe key task here is to get people out of the rubble and provide assistance to those we can reach, as we have already taken out all the first ones,\u201d Liashko said in a Telegram post. The attacks were part of a rare daylight bombardment on Ukrainian cities, some of which are heavily populated areas far from the front lines. It came a day before US President Joe Biden hosts a crucial NATO Summit in Washington, where new announcements over the alliance\u2019s military, political and financial support for Kyiv are expected. Biden called the strikes a \u201chorrific reminder of Russia\u2019s brutality.\u201d \u201cIt is critical that the world continues to stand with Ukraine at this important moment and that we not ignore Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said, noting that he would meet with Zelensky during the summit \u201cto make clear our support for Ukraine is unshakeable.\u201d \u201cTogether with our allies, we will be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s air defenses to help protect their cities and civilians from Russian strikes,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, seven people were killed in a Russian attack Monday on a private medical facility in Kyiv belonging to the Adonis network, the company said. Of those killed, five were staff members and two were patients, Adonis said. Russia\u2019s defense ministry on Monday claimed that Moscow had struck \u201cmilitary industrial facilities of Ukraine and air bases of the Ukrainian armed forces\u201d using long-range, high-precision weapons. Eyewitnesses recount hospital strike Natalia Sardudinova, a senior nurse, described the moment the strike hit the children\u2019s hospital, saying that \u201cit was scary, but we survived.\u201d \u201cIt was loud, the windows were crunching,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAs soon as the alarm sounded, the children were taken out into the corridor.\u201d She said two children had been in the operating theaters at the time of the blast, and both were relocated to the basement shelter once their procedures were completed. \u201cEverything was in smoke, there was no air to breathe. The doctor was cut by shrapnel. The windows and doors were blown out. One nurse in the hospital was heavily injured,\u201d Sardudinova added. \u201cMy hands are still shaking. They don\u2019t let anyone in now, they are afraid it will collapse.\u201d Yulia Vasylenko, the mother of an 11-year-old cancer patient at the hospital, said her son Denys was evacuated outside following the strike. \u201cMy son is on painkillers. He has cancer. He has been without medication for half a day. He was brought down the stairs from the third floor. There was smoke (and) heavy dust,\u201d she said. Iryna Filimonova, a senior nurse at the pediatric urology department, told CNN an operation on a 2-year-old was underway when the strike happened. \u201cThe lights went out, everything went out. We pulled out the instruments, shining flashlights. Everything was sewn up quickly,\u201d Filimonova said. \u201cThe baby was brought down (to the shelter). I immediately ran to help clear the rubble. Some of my nursing colleagues who worked in the operating theaters and some doctors were cut by glass fragments. Our department was destroyed.\u201d Another operating theater nurse, Oksana Mosiychuk, said they sheltered in the emergency room when the explosion rocked the building. After that, she added, the medical team had to extinguish a blaze that broke out in their department, including an operating table which had caught fire. \u201cFortunately, everyone is alive. One of our colleagues was heavily injured, he had numerous cuts and shrapnel wounds, and was taken away by an ambulance. I also have minor shrapnel wounds, but I\u2019m fine. It was very scary. I was scared for the children,\u201d she said. A UN team who visited the site after the strike saw children \u201creceiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds set up in parks and on streets, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas, amongst chaos, dust and debris,\u201d the UN\u2019s human rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. \u201cShockingly, one of the strikes severely damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Okhmatdyt, which is Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s referral hospital, and destroyed its children\u2019s toxicology department, where children receive dialysis,\u201d Turk said. In the hospital\u2019s newer building, 12 departments were damaged, and a section of Ukraine\u2019s only oncology and hematology laboratory was completely destroyed, according to the Kyiv military administration. UN holds special meeting The UN Security Council will hold a special meeting on Tuesday to discuss Russia\u2019s deadly strike on the children\u2019s hospital, after Zelensky called for an emergency assembly while vowing retaliation over the attacks. The Ukrainian leader said in a post on X that the exact number of casualties at the hospital was not yet known and that \u201cthere are people under the rubble\u201d but that everyone from doctors to local residents are helping clear debris in the strike\u2019s aftermath. \u201cApartment buildings, infrastructure, and a children\u2019s hospital have been damaged. All services are engaged to rescue as many people as possible,\u201d Zelensky wrote in a post on X. Ukraine shot down 30 out of 38 missiles launched by Russia during its attack on Monday, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Force said in a statement, adding that Moscow used ballistic, cruise, guided and air-launched ballistic missiles. Ukrainian defense minister, Rustem Umerov, appealed for more air defense systems to support the war-torn country. Zelensky has repeatedly called on the West to provide it with more air defense systems to better protect its cities. Last month, he praised Biden for prioritizing the delivery of air defense systems after the two presidents signed a security agreement between their nations. Air raid sirens continued to ring out over Kyiv in the aftermath, with CNN video showing people who had been evacuated outside the hospital pushing children on stretchers to safety in shelters. Scores of volunteers later dropped off much-needed supplies and donations \u2013 including water, food, medicine and diapers \u2013 to the hospital. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general sent evidence of Monday\u2019s Russian attacks to the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Monday. It came as several European nations denounced the shelling, with France urging for the attack to \u201cbe added to the list of war crimes for which Russia will be held to account.\u201d The United Kingdom\u2019s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, described the hospital strike on innocent children as \u201cthe most depraved of actions.\u201d A top official at the UN\u2019s children\u2019s agency, executive director Catherine Russell said the devastation wrought on the medical facility \u201cis yet another brutal reminder that nowhere is safe for children in Ukraine.\u201d According to the World Health Organization, there have been more than 1,600 instances of heavy weapons attacks impacting medical facilities in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, with 141 people killed in these attacks. Last December, 12 pregnant women and four newborn babies had a lucky escape from a maternity hospital in Dnipro that had been extensively damaged in an airstrike. Previously, the bombing of a maternity and children\u2019s hospital in Mariupol less than a month after Russian troops flooded across the border sparked international condemnation. \u201cIt\u2019s a really difficult day in our hometown. Today\u2019s one of the biggest massive missiles attack on our hometown,\u201d Vitali Klitschko, the\u00a0mayor of Kyiv, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson.

{"id": "2024_07_08_middleeast_israel-hamas-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands-explainer-mime-intl", "text": "Israeli and US officials showed optimism last week around a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, as the Palestinian militant group expressed willingness to compromise on a key sticking point. But an agreement may still be elusive despite the new momentum. Optimism that a deal may finally be reached came as a senior Hamas official confirmed to CNN Saturday that the group is ready to reconsider its demand that Israel must commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement that would usher in a temporary truce and begin a process to release hostages still held in Gaza. Last week, a US official told CNN that a framework agreement is \u201cin place\u201d and talks resumed Friday in Doha. And, according to Egypt\u2019s state-affiliated Al-Qahera News channel, they will continue in Cairo this week. A statement by the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office on Sunday, however, cast doubt on whether the deal would progress, laying out several \u201cprinciples\u201d Israel is not prepared to abandon, including resumed fighting in Gaza \u201cuntil all of objectives of the war have been achieved.\u201d Israel launched its war on Gaza nine months ago, in response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The war has left swathes of the enclave unrecognizable, displaced almost the entire population and killed more than 38,000 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. Israel had said it wouldn\u2019t end the war until all hostages are freed and Hamas is eliminated. Some experts say Netanyahu\u2019s statement on Sunday suggests the deal may face new hurdles. The prime minister\u2019s conditions block \u201cany possibility of progress from the Israeli side,\u201d Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who once acted as a channel to Hamas, told CNN, adding that the conditions were \u201ccompletely against what Hamas\u2019 demands are.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that Hamas will give in to additional Israeli demands,\u201d such as staying on the Philadelphi Corridor, Baskin said, referring to the 14-kilometer (about 8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border. Hamas is also unlikely to agree to an Israeli demand of \u201ca veto on the selection of Palestinian prisoners to be released.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know about where the talks stand. What is the deal that is on the table? US President Joe Biden in May laid out a three-phase proposal that he said Israel had submitted, as he declared \u201cit\u2019s time for this war to end.\u201d The first phase of the potential agreement would last six weeks and include the \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza\u201d as well as the \u201crelease of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d Phase 2 would allow for the \u201cexchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers.\u201d In Phase 3, the president said, a \u201cmajor reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence and any final remains of hostages who\u2019ve been killed will be returned to their families.\u201d On Thursday, a senior US administration told CNN\u00a0that the framework for a deal is \u201cnow in place,\u201d following a call between Biden and Netanyahu. An Israeli source familiar with the negotiations echoed a similar message earlier on Wednesday, telling CNN the two sides appear to be on the brink of a framework agreement. What is Hamas\u2019 position? Hamas has long demanded that Israel agree to a permanent ceasefire before signing any deal, which Israel has so far refused. The senior Hamas official \u2013 who had been involved in negotiations \u2013 told CNN Saturday the group would instead accept that talks on reaching a permanent ceasefire would take place throughout the first phase of any deal, which would last six weeks. This means, in the first phase, mediators would guarantee a temporary truce, the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Indirect talks\u00a0would continue towards implementing the second phase of the agreement. The demand for a prior commitment to a permanent ceasefire had been a key sticking point for Israel, as Netanyahu insisted his country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated \u2013 a goal critics deem too ambitious to achieve. What is Netanyahu\u2019s position? Netanyahu on Thursday authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed talks in a bid to broker a deal, an Israeli official and a source familiar with the negotiations said, signaling progress after weeks of deadlock. In a statement Sunday, however, Netanyahu\u2019s office published a list of principles that it said will not be infringed upon by the plan agreed to by Israel and Biden. The prime minister\u2019s \u201csteadfast position\u201d against calls to halt Israeli military action in the southern Gaza city of Rafah is what brought Hamas to the negotiating table, the statement said. The principles include a resumption of the war until \u201call of objectives of the war have been achieved\u201d and the prevention of \u201csmuggling of weapons to Hamas from Egypt to the Gaza border.\u201d Israel began a ground operation in Rafah on\u00a0May 7, crossing the Philadelphi Corridor and seizing the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Israel has long accused Hamas of using the Philadelphi corridor to smuggle weapons from Egypt. Netanyahu also said there will be \u201cno return of thousands of armed terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip,\u201d the statement said. What is the White House saying? A US official told CNN Thursday that last week\u2019s call between Biden and Netanyahu seemed to reach a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d on the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2, adding that the deal is now \u201cvery consistent\u201d with what Biden had laid out in May. Asked if the administration believes that Netanyahu is playing politics and could try to sabotage the deal, the official said the deal is structured in a way that \u201cfully protects Israel\u2019s interests.\u201d The developments came after the US proposed new language to help bridge gaps in discussions for a deal, and as Biden scrambled for political survival after floundering in a presidential debate against his predecessor Donald Trump. Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict has been a key issue for voters. Are the two sides closer to a deal? Optimism that a deal may be reached has possibly been dampened by Netanyahu\u2019s demands on Sunday. Opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the prime minister, calling his statement \u201cprovocative.\u201d \u201cWhat is it good for? We are at a critical moment in the negotiations, the lives of the abductees depend on it,\u201d Lapid wrote Sunday on X.\u00a0\u201cWhy issue such provocative messages? How does it contribute to the process?\u201d Baskin, the former negotiator, said that added US pressure is unlikely to sway the Israeli prime minister, who is battling for political survival amid anti-government protests demanding his resignation.  Netanyahu is also bound by the demands of right-wing ministers in his coalition who are opposed to any compromise with Hamas. US pressure is \u201cstrongly diminished now\u201d after Biden\u2019s debate against Trump, Baskin said. Biden\u2019s weak debate performance only led more Democrats to express doubts that he can beat his opponent in the upcoming election. \u201cIf the Americans are still optimistic (after Netanyahu\u2019s Sunday statement), then they are really living in La La land,\u201d Baskin told CNN. \u201cThey have really no idea what is going on in the mind of Netanyahu.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands-explainer-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_uk_britains-keir-starmer-hard-part-gbr-intl", "text": "Keir Starmer\u2019s historic victory in Britain\u2019s general election Thursday hands him a level of power that was unthinkable for a Labour leader just five years ago. To win a working parliamentary majority of over 170 seats just four-and-a-half years after his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, led the party to its worst loss in a generation is nothing short of remarkable. Starmer was arguably elected on a mandate of change rather than on a personal endorsement. It is no secret that a large number of voters were not voting exactly for Starmer himself, but to get rid of a Conservative Party that had been in power for 14 years and led the country through some of its most chaotic days in peacetime. The change the country has voted for could be interpreted in many ways, as there is a lot wrong with the UK right now. Waiting lists for doctors\u2019 appointments are in the millions. The cost-of-living crisis that has plagued Europe left many in Britain having to make unthinkable decisions between heating their homes or eating. Immigration, particularly irregular migration, has become a major issue for voters on the right. There are many more examples but, bluntly, there has been a sense for some time that the UK simply doesn\u2019t function well as a country. If the Brexit vote of 2016 told the British political establishment anything, it\u2019s that large parts of the nation were fed up with the status quo. If nothing else, Starmer has to make the people of Britain feel that they are living better lives with his time in office. But he must do so with some challenges, despite the size of his majority. It is no secret that he doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of public money to spend. He has loosely pledged not to raise taxes. Convincing the public that the Labour Party could be trusted with public finances was a big part of his electoral campaign. This combination of limited public money and a promise to balance the books runs into another of the key challenges facing Starmer: those in his own party who believe he should be radical. Of course, Labour members and activists are pleased to see the back of the Conservative Party after 14 long years in power. But some, especially on the left of the party, don\u2019t want to see a thumping majority squandered on moderate policy that returns right-wingers to power in five years. Their concerns may not be completely unfounded. While the story of this election is Starmer\u2019s landslide, the anti-Conservative vote split in a few different directions. Most notably, the hard-right Reform UK, led by friend of Donald Trump Nigel Farage, secured 14% of the national vote. Reform took a lot of votes from the Conservatives through vicious attacks on its record in government. It\u2019s extremely likely that with Starmer now in power, Farage and his acolytes will turn their attention to tearing chunks out of the Labour Party. If Starmer decides to stick to his moderate guns, it isn\u2019t hard to see how Reform starts labeling this Labour government as virtually the same as the Conservatives, using populist rhetoric that clearly appeals to many in Britain. On the other hand, Starmer cannot afford to spook the center-ground majority that just put him in Downing Street, having believed and trusted his message that he would be stable and responsible. Delivering meaningful change while trying to stand still is not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination. It is likely that Starmer will soon have to make some difficult decisions that will deviate in some way from his pledges made while running for office. This is normal, and most governments have to make some compromises while in power. But it will upset some of his own base. Fortunately for Starmer, he has quite a lot of political capital to spend. What he must now decide is who he spends it on.

{"id": "2024_07_04_style_hong-kong-disneyland-dress-up-disneybound-intl-hnk", "text": "There are a lot of princesses at Hong Kong Disneyland, but not the ones you think. Instead of your Cinderellas, Elsas and Annas in their royal best, it\u2019s a fuzzy pink fox that\u2019s inspiring the princess-esque outfits of Disney-goers in their teens and 20s. LinaBell is the latest addition to a line of plush toys called \u201cDuffy and Friends,\u201d created by Disney for the Asian market. She has never made it onto the big screen, but she and her furry companions have resonated with fans in the region, becoming one of the company\u2019s best-selling franchises in the city\u2019s theme park. Young women in particular are drawing inspiration from the pastel-colored characters, creating coquettish looks. \u201cLinaBell is my favorite,\u201d said Liang Xiaoyu who was visiting from the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The 18-year-old was dressed in a pink-trimmed white frock, her hair in two loose ponytails, and was carrying a LinaBell backpack and keychain. Others spotted during a rainy June day channeled CookieAnn (a yellow dog who loves to bake), by wearing dog-ear headbands as well as ShellieMay and Duffy, the line\u2019s two bears. Dressing up is popular at Disney theme parks across the world \u2014 not just for kids, but for adults as well. Known as \u201cDisneybounding,\u201d the phenomenon sees visitors circumvent rules on wearing full Disney costumes (some masks, for instance, are banned\u00a0to avoid any confusion with the parks\u2019 own costumed employees) by using clothing and accessories that evoke their favorite characters. Qin Wuxiao, dressed from head to toe as Jessie the cowgirl doll from the \u201cToy Story\u201d franchise, was taking photos with her mother in front of the Castle of Magical Dreams. The 23-year-old student said it\u2019s become popular for young people to dress up like characters and post pictures of themselves on Chinese social media apps like Xiaohongshu. Charmy Chan and her friend Yanni Chung dressed for the day as Officer Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde from \u201cZootopia.\u201d The Hong Kong Baptist University students grew up watching Disney movies and now that they\u2019re in college they find themselves with more time to visit. \u201cWe usually come to the park once a month,\u201d said Chan, in front of the park\u2019s bakery on Main Street USA.  And at Hong Kong Disneyland, Disney characters aren\u2019t the sole fashion inspiration for dedicated fans. All around the park, there were guests like 27-year-old Li Mengru from China\u2019s Fujian province and 16-year-old Chen Xinyu from Guangdong province, dressed as Lolitas.  Not a Nabokovian Lolita, but women who dress in an unabashedly feminine style of clothing popularized in Japan in the mid-1990s. Think petticoats, dainty shoes and accessories. Li wore a light baby blue dress with statement bows and elaborate crystal nails, while Chen went with a more gothic look. Linda Lee, meanwhile, wore a bold striped black and white dress adorned with cherries and red ribbons. In the age of Instagram and TikTok, the park lends a perfect background for Disneybounders and cosplayers to immerse themselves in a fantasy world. There\u2019s the World of Frozen that opened in November last year, where influencers can be found taking photos in front of a snowflake fountain on the streets of Arendelle. Tomorrowland lends itself as a futuristic backdrop for Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans while Toy Story Land with its outsize wooden blocks, green army men and race cars make for some playful shots. A sweet escape Since the pandemic, the city \u2013 which imposed some of the world\u2019s strictest travel restrictions \u2013 has been looking to boost tourism numbers by launching a \u201cHello Hong Kong\u201d campaign, that included giving away free flights. Though most visitors to the park are local residents, the majority government-owned Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is one of the key attractions being promoted to tourists. The Hong Kong Tourism Board\u2019s exit survey of around 93,000 people in 2023 showed the park was the third most visited attraction in the city. The shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui and scenic spot The Peak were the two top spots respectively. Many of the non-local visitors to Hong Kong Disneyland live in mainland China or countries in Southeast Asia like the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore, with some coming from Japan and South Korea as well. Wandering into Adventureland from Grizzly Gulch, 34-year-old Kris Yang and 35-year-old Jimmy Redinger stopped to chat with CNN.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s crazy about Disney,\u201d said Yang who is from mainland China of his partner, who is from the United States. The two primary school teachers were visiting from the northern Chinese province of Hebei. They wore shirts from \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cHercules\u201d and were decked out in Disney paraphernalia. \u201cIf you like my outfit today, you should have seen me yesterday,\u201d said Redinger who proudly identified himself as a \u201cDisney adult,\u201d a term that might come with some baggage in the United States, given some of the extremes fans have gone viral for. \u201cI was in a full Goofy movie get-up.\u201d \u201cI embrace the idea of a \u2018Disney adult\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s in the name. Adults who love Disney. Someone who really has that connection to the company and parks.\u201d In Asia, the penchant for child-like things as adults broadly carries less social stigma than in the West. China\u2019s \u201cmeng\u201d and Japan\u2019s \u201ckawaii\u201d cultures embrace cuteness. Many, like 37-year-old Mariko Otomo kitted out in Disney accessories, were there as a form of escape. \u201cUsually we work very hard. We go office and back, office and back,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we finally come to Disney we forget the daily stuff.\u201d \u201cEven just walking here, (I) have a good feeling,\u201d said Ankh Wong a 24-year-old saleswoman who has visited the park more than 20 times over the past six years. As soon as she got her first job, she bought a ticket to the park. \u201cIt\u2019s a place for happiness and I can put down my worries,\u201d said 16-year-old Deng Chundan. Tactics like themed staycations and special events, collaborations with brands like Le Creuset, Godiva and local jeweler Chow Tai Fook and cultivating successful franchises such as Duffy and Friends are part of the park\u2019s strategy to appeal to Gen Z and millennials. In recent years, the park has invested a reported $1.4 billion in expanding some of its attractions, which included a new \u201cFrozen\u201d themed section of the park. (\u201cFrozen,\u201d which came out in 2013, is likely one of the first Disney films Gen Z would have watched as children). Disney declined CNN\u2019s request for information on the ages of its annual visitors, but it\u2019s clear the Hong Kong park draws many grown-up fans. Redinger said nostalgia brings him back time and time again. \u201cAs the parks grow, we grow with the parks, reliving that time with our families (that) we had.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/style/hong-kong-disneyland-dress-up-disneybound-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

Their peaceful green campaigns have been championed by climate activist Greta Thunberg and in 2015, they successfully fought against a plan for a hydroelectric dam they claim would have damaged a pristine rainforest valley. But this week, the Southeast Asian nation sentenced 10 activists from the group Mother Nature Cambodia to up to six years in prison each on charges of conspiring against the state. The government says the group encourages social unrest, but to their supporters, the ruling is just the latest in a pattern of attacks on climate activists in the wider region. \u201cWe demand that our friends in Mother Nature Cambodia, and all political prisoners, be released immediately,\u201d said Fridays for Future, the youth-led global climate strike movement founded by Thunberg, in a statement. Exiled opposition leader Mu Sochua said the group had tried to highlight environmental issues that \u201cthreaten Cambodia\u2019s fragile environment\u201d and claimed, \u201cthey would be heroes in any free country.\u201d \u201cTheir convictions only show how Cambodian courts are simply being used as weapons (by the state) to halt any kind of public discussion,\u201d Mu Sochua told CNN. \u201cThe sentences are a disaster for environmentalism in Cambodia and for people everywhere, who care about the future of our planet.\u201d Cambodia, a kingdom of nearly 17 million people that is rich in natural resources, faces pressing threats to its environment, including deforestation from illegal logging and agricultural expansion, water pollution affecting inland and coastal areas, and a surge in plastic waste. The country maintains about 46% forest cover and is home to 2,300 plant species and 14 endangered animals, according to the United States Agency for International Development. \u201cDeforestation and wildlife crimes continue to threaten Cambodia\u2019s forests and biodiversity,\u201d USAID says on its website. Critics and environmental groups say those threats have heightened under the nearly four-decade-long rule of strongman Hun Sen \u2013 who has quashed dissent and jailed opponents in recent years, forcing many to flee overseas. Though his eldest son, Hun Manet, succeeded him as prime minister last year, Hun Sen is still widely seen as the ruling party\u2019s center of power. \u201cLike what we are seeing with dictators in other countries, Cambodia is becoming more repressed,\u201d said Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, a Spaniard who co-founded Mother Nature Cambodia over a decade ago, alongside local Cambodian activists. Climate activism in the country is at a \u201crougher, grassroots level,\u201d he added, with the conversation centering more on \u201cextremely rich and powerful tycoons and corrupt government officials trying to exploit and privatize,\u201d the environment. \u201cThis is Cambodia now \u2013 logging, poaching, mineral extraction, turning lakes into land and destroying rivers, as well as exporting massive amounts of sands. There are systems in place where (officials) exploit the environment for profit and our group has been doing as much as we can to stop these unethical projects and protect the environment \u2013 and that is why we are a threat in the regime\u2019s eyes.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Cambodian government for comment on the court ruling and allegations in this story. Outside the court ahead of Tuesday\u2019s ruling, a government spokesperson denied that the charges against the activists were politically motivated. \u201cThe government has never taken action against those who criticize. We only take action against those who commit crimes,\u201d spokesperson Pen Bona told Reuters. Award-winning campaigners Founded in 2012, Mother Nature Cambodia has campaigned against environmental destruction and exposed alleged corruption in state management of precious mineral resources, and their savvy use of social media has resonated with young Cambodians. In 2023, the group was awarded the Right Livelihood Award, often called the \u201calternative Nobel Prize.\u201d \u201cMother Nature Cambodia is a group of fearless young activists fighting for environmental rights and democracy in the face of repression by the Cambodian regime,\u201d the jury said in a speech at the time, describing them as \u201ca powerful voice for environmental preservation and democracy in Cambodia.\u201d Several activists were unable to receive the award in person as Cambodian courts denied their requests to travel to Sweden to collect the prize. \u201cThey have successfully helped local communities stop environmental violations,\u201d Right Livelihood\u2019s executive director Ole von Uexkuell said last year. \u201cThrough innovative and often humorous protests, their activism defends nature and livelihoods while upholding communities\u2019 voices against corrupt and damaging products.\u201d The group has strongly leveraged social media, saying it helps get their message across to young supporters. They have more than 450,000 followers on Facebook, the most widely used social platform in the country. But it\u2019s on TikTok that their videos really make an impression on young Cambodian users like Run Bunry, a high-school student from the capital Phnom Penh and his friends. \u201cThey are positive and lighthearted and also teach us a lot about the environment,\u201d he said. One video, highlighting an investigation into the alleged illegal export of rare silica sand, showed three members buried up to their heads in sand and was shared more than 1,000 times. Another viral video taken along a beach in the coastal city Sihanoukville showed the extent of alleged illegal construction by hotels and casinos on the shore. \u201cFollower numbers have grown especially in the last five years and a lot of our old content regularly resurfaces on TikTok and goes viral,\u201d said founding member Gonzalez-Davidson, who was expelled from Cambodia in 2015 after the group\u2019s successful campaign to stop a Chinese-funded hydropower dam from being built over the Areng Valley, an area of pristine rainforest in southwest Cambodia. Members of the group say they have faced increasing threats, harassment and criminal charges for years. Under scorching heat on Tuesday, members of the group \u2013 dressed in white and accompanied by a crowd of supporters \u2013 staged a mock funeral procession in the streets leading to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. But peaceful scenes descended into chaos after the sentencing was announced. Video footage showed activists Mother Nature Cambodia activists Ly Chandaravuth, Long Kunthea, Thun Ratha, Phuon Keoraksmey and Yim Leanghy surrounded by dozens of armed police officers and dragged away into waiting cars, bound for prisons across the country. Rights activist Pilorge Naly of NGO the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights was at the scene and told CNN the arrests were immediate and violent. Journalists and supporters were also pushed and shoved by security officers, she said. Arrest warrants have been issued for five other members of the group, including Gonzalez-Davidson, who was sentenced to eight years in prison Tuesday on the conspiracy charge and insulting Cambodia\u2019s king. \u201cThe increasing use by Cambodian authorities of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 and other articles of Cambodia\u2019s criminal code to penalise the exercise of human rights is deeply worrying,\u201d United Nations Human Rights spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement following the ruling. Gonzalez-Davidson, however, said the ruling would backfire against the authorities and inspire a new cohort of environmental campaigners. \u201cThis week, a new generation of Cambodian activists was born \u2013 one that did not exist back in 2012,\u201d he said. \u201cMany young Cambodians are very engaged in the next steps and public campaigning must continue. There have been (arrests and jailings) before and each time, we come out stronger. \u201cThey won\u2019t break our spirits. We are not going to be shut down.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/asia/mother-nature-cambodia-climate-youth-activists-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
