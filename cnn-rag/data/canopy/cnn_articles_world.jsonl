Despite the school shuttering its doors due to financial difficulties, the Panthers defeated Randolph-Macon 9-7 on Saturday with a walk-off home run in Eastlake, Ohio to stay alive in the Division III College World Series. They completed their win in dramatic fashion when, with the score tied 7-7 heading into the bottom of the ninth inning, first baseman Jackson Webster hit a two-run walk-off home run to continue on the school\u2019s \u201cCinderella story.\u201d It sparked delirious scenes in the crowd and at watch parties back in Birmingham while Webster was mobbed by his teammates who were all waiting for him at home plate. \u201cBaseball miracle, right?\u201d Webster said, per the NCAA. \u201cThe storybook isn\u2019t finished. It\u2019s a hard pill to swallow. We don\u2019t have anything to go back to so we take the field like we don\u2019t have anything to lose. And a team that has nothing to lose is a team that\u2019s hard to beat.\u201d The Panthers had jumped to an early 4-0 lead by the bottom of the third but faltered in the middle innings after a series of mistakes and trailed 7-4 by the eighth. After losing their opening game on Friday, they had to win this one to remain in the tournament and even their head coach Jan Weisberg had doubts creep into his mind. \u201cYou just had the feeling of this is how it\u2019s going to end,\u201d he said afterwards, according to the NCAA. \u201cWhat this team has been through in particular \u2026 with all that we\u2019ve had hanging on our heads, there had to be some thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it happened to me for a brief second in between innings. I started thinking about what am I going to say, am I going to keep it together? And I just told myself stop, just stop.\u201d Then, all three of their pinch hitters delivered at the plate in the ninth inning, giving Webster an opportunity to seal the victory, though on his first swing he mistimed his effort so badly that he tapped his chest to apologize. He connected on the third pitch, however, and sent it over the left field wall for a famous win. The Panthers will play Wisconsin-Whitewater on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET, and should they win that match, they will play again on Monday for a place in the national championship game. Should they lose, it will mark the end of an improbable run despite the difficult circumstances. Birmingham-Southern was a private liberal arts school, located in Birmingham, Alabama, which opened its doors in 1856. In March, the school\u00a0announced\u00a0it would close and then the baseball team went on a miraculous run to clinch a spot in the DIII College World Series with the help of a GoFundMe page. Along with the GoFundMe page, Topps\u00a0announced\u00a0earlier this week it was producing trading cards featuring Birmingham-Southern\u2019s baseball team with proceeds going to the program. Topps also said it was giving some cards to \u201cdistribute to players, friends & family.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/sport/birmingham-southern-cinderella-run-diii-world-series-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea said it was stopping sending trash-filled balloons to South Korea after Seoul reported hundreds more airborne waste deliveries floating across the border. North Korea\u2019s vice-defense minister Kim Kang Il said that the country will \u201ctemporarily halt dropping trash over the border,\u201d after claiming to have sent a total of 15 tonnes of trash to its neighbor, according to his statement released by state media KCNA on Sunday. Kim said the balloon were \u201cstrictly a responsive act\u201d to South Korea\u2019s years-long practice of sending balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets the other way. \u201cWe\u2019ve let the South Koreans experience enough of how dirty it feels and how much joint effort it takes to clean up spread-out rubbish,\u201d Kim said. A South\u00a0Korean official pledged his country would take\u00a0\u201cunendurable measures\u201d against North\u00a0Korea for sending more trash balloons this weekend, which will be \u201cspecified in the coming days.\u201d The official from the presidential office added that the government \u201cwill\u00a0not rule out the issue of resuming [playing] loudspeakers\u201d that used to blast propaganda across the demilitarized zone, but had been turned off since a military agreement was signed in 2018. South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff\u00a0said \u201cno substances harmful to safety\u201d were found among the hundreds more balloons that reached the country on Saturday evening \u2013 unlike just a few days ago when used toilet paper was found in some of the about 150 balloons that crossed the border. The latest photos released by the JCS show a large sack containing what appears to be paper left on the roadside, while other images show officers inspecting the garbage strewn on the ground. Others showed burned-out cigarette butts. According to images released by authorities, the packages are conveyed by large, gas-filled balloons. South Korea said its military is working with the police, local government, safety ministry, and the United Nations Command to safely retrieve the balloons and the debris. The balloons were found in the capital Seoul, as well as the provinces of Gyeonggi and Chungcheong. Some were even spotted more than 300 kilometers (over 185 miles) south of the capital, in Gyeongsang province. The two neighboring countries\u00a0have been cut off from each other since the end of the\u00a0Korean War in 1953\u00a0with an armistice. They are still technically at war. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s sister Kim Yo Jong \u2013 a senior official in the reclusive regime \u2013 called the balloons \u201csincere presents,.\u201d North Korea is almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting\u00a0strict rules to snap back\u00a0into place.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_africa_south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl", "text": "Millions of South Africans are voting in what is expected to be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. For months, polls have shown the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201cone of the most important elections in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d while addressing a crowd of thousands at Soweto\u2019s FNB soccer stadium on Saturday. \u201cOur people will decide whether our country continues moving forward with the ANC towards a better, brighter future or backwards to a terrible past,\u201d Ramaphosa said. The South African leader, who cast his ballot at a polling station in Soweto, told reporters on Wednesday that he has \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that voters will again trust in the ANC. \u201cThis is the day when South Africa decides, decides on the future of our country, (on) who should lead the government of South Africa, and I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart of hearts that the people will once again invest confidence in the African National Congress to continue to lead this country,\u201d Ramaphosa\u00a0said. South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, according to the World Bank. Citizens are also contending with the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world, rampant corruption, feeble economic growth, crippling power cuts and\u00a0rising violent crime. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Voters in Johannesburg told CNN they headed to vote shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, and many expressed their hopes that the country would move in a different direction. \u201cWe want to see the change,\u201d said Sydney Radebe. \u201cThis is a rich country but people don\u2019t have anything,\u201d the 66-year-old actor and filmmaker added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have land, we don\u2019t have property\u2026 you cannot own nothing and say you are \u2018free.\u2019\u201d Radebe was among the first early morning voters at one of the biggest polling stations in Johannesburg. On a crisp morning as the Southern Hemisphere heads into winter, the line of voters gradually began to grow inside Joubert Park. Events worker Newton Ugboh, 20, was voting for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m looking for change so I came early in the morning,\u201d he said. Ugboh said that some of his friends didn\u2019t want to vote as \u201cthey think things aren\u2019t going to change at all,\u201d but that there are \u201cbig issues\u201d facing young people in the country. The \u201cunemployment rate is crazy,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cbig-time struggle to find work, most of my friends are unemployed.\u201d Healthcare worker Roselyne Tswakae, 46, said she\u2019s worried about the future of South Africa\u2019s youth and also believes \u201cit\u2019s time for change.\u201d \u201cYoung South Africans were promised that education would be the key to success, they went to university but they are unemployed and often end up getting involved in drugs, drinking, smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hoping for the light,\u201d Tswakae added. Land surveyor David Ngobeni, 31, also said \u201cthere isn\u2019t much hope\u201d for young people in South Africa. He says unemployment, inflation, crime and corruption are the \u201cbig issues facing everyone right now.\u201d \u201cIf you have a job, you are very lucky,\u201d Ngobeni told CNN. He added that he hopes the outcome of this election will lead to inflation going down and boost the economy. At the very end of a long line in Joubert Park was 40-year-old Ncumisa Xabanisa. She said she has been voting for the same party since 1994 and is very loyal to the ANC. \u201cit\u2019s only one party for me, it\u2019s from home, it\u2019s from my grandmother, I grew up knowing them,\u201d Xabanisa told CNN. She said the major problem the country is facing is a lack of jobs. \u201cSome of us we went to school, we graduated but we have the certificates like it\u2019s a display. It\u2019s hurting.\u201d The mother-of-two added that she is educated but is currently sitting at home most of the time, and sells plastic food containers to make a living. There are 52 parties on this election\u2019s national ballot, including new parties formed by previous ANC members such as former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK). Zuma was forced to\u00a0resign as president in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court. The 82-year-old was barred from running for parliament last week after the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that five years must have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. However, his party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Capping off a heated few months of election campaigning, many of the largest parties held their final rallies this weekend, including the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition party. \u201cOn Wednesday, the ANC will lose the outright majority it has abused for decades to subject the people of this country to unemployment, corruption and misrule\u2026 we close the ANC chapter of our history,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told supporters in the town of Benoni, east of Johannesburg. The DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The country\u2019s electoral commission (IEC) said that, by 11 a.m. in South Africa, a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of voters had already cast their ballots, as lines to vote had formed before the polls opened. \u201cThis, we think, is testament to the enthusiasm of South Africans to record their political choice,\u201d the IEC\u2019s deputy CEO Masego Sheburi added during a briefing at the National Results Center. Sheburi said that some voting stations opened late, but by midday \u201cgood progress\u201d was made with \u201cminimal incidences\u201d across the country. One of the issues some polling stations faced was late delivery of ballot papers, mainly in the Johannesburg area, according to the IEC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/africa/south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_china_xi-jinping-arab-leaders-china-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping decried \u201ctremendous sufferings\u201d in the Middle East and called for an international peace conference as leaders from Arab nations visit Beijing this week amid mounting global concern over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. \u201cSince last October, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has escalated drastically, throwing the people into tremendous sufferings. War should not continue indefinitely. Justice should not be absent forever,\u201d Xi said Thursday at the opening of a meeting between top diplomats from China and Arab states, also attended by several leaders from the region. He also reiterated China\u2019s call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, as well as Beijing\u2019s support for a \u201cmore broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference.\u201d The diplomatic\u00a0gatherings in Beijing come as Israel\u2019s war in Gaza remains an urgent global focus, as Israeli forces intensify operations in the enclave\u2019s southern city of Rafah\u00a0and a humanitarian crisis worsens by the day. Delegations from 22 Arab states met\u00a0at Beijing\u2019s\u00a0Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, according to Chinese state media. Later Thursday, Chinese and Arab-nation ministers adopted a strident joint statement condemning Israel\u2019s \u201caggression against the Palestinian people\u201d and in Rafah, according to the document as published by Chinese state media Friday. The statement \u2013 which adopted some of China\u2019s most pointed language to date on the conflict \u2013 decried what it described as a \u201cdeadly famine and blockade that has cut off all livelihoods\u201d and \u201csystematic\u201d destruction of residential areas, hospitals, schools, mosques, churches and infrastructure in Gaza. Israel has repeatedly defended its operations in the enclave as necessary to eradicate the militant group Hamas. China, which has sought to deepen its relations across the Middle East in recent years, has positioned itself in alignment with the Arab world and the broader Global South on the nearly eight-month-long conflict, criticizing Israel and calling for a ceasefire. Its stance has put it at odds with the United States, long a key power in the region and a primary backer of Israel. Chinese officials have used the conflict to hit out at Washington\u00a0\u2013 fitting into a larger\u00a0message\u00a0from Beijing that frames the US as an aggressor unfairly dominating the current world order. Xi in his remarks\u00a0hailed a \u201ccommon desire for a new era of China-Arab relations\u201d and said their relations could be a \u201cmodel for maintaining world peace and stability.\u201d \u201cIn this turbulent world, peaceful relations come from mutual respect, and lasting security is built on fairness and justice,\u201d said the Chinese leader, who has pushed for an alternative model for global security to the alliance-based one backed by the US. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi,\u00a0United Arab Emirates President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Bahrain\u2019s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, and Tunisian President Kais Saied are in China for state visits that coincide with the ministerial meeting. War in Gaza on the agenda Following the gathering, Wang told reporters the \u201cstrongest call of the meeting was one to firmly support the Palestinian people in restoring their legitimate national rights.\u201d \u201cThe joint statement puts forward a just voice to promote the speedy resolution of the Gaza conflict and the comprehensive, fair and lasting resolution of the Palestinian issue,\u201d Wang said, according to Chinese state media. Israel declared war on Hamas in Gaza following the militant group\u2019s October 7 attack on its territory that killed some 1,200 people and saw more than 200 taken hostage, according to Israeli forces. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of Israeli military operations in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Since the start of the war, Beijing has positioned itself as a champion for the broader issue of a two-state solution, which would see the international recognition of a Palestinian state. The stance is in line with the country\u2019s recognition of the Palestinian state in 1988. China has also dispatched rounds of envoys to the region to meet Arab counterparts and supported calls for a ceasefire in the United Nations. It has not explicitly condemned Hamas for the October 7 attacks. Beijing last month hosted representatives from rival Palestinian groups Fatah and Hamas for \u201creconciliation\u201d talks. In Thursday\u2019s joint statement, China and its Arab-nation counterparts also called for the \u201cend of the occupation of the territory of the State of Palestine\u201d and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. It also condemned the US for using its United Nations Security Council veto to block a resolution that would have recommended granting full Palestinian UN membership. With its diplomacy this week, China \u201cwants to demonstrate leadership, consolidate ties, and call for ceasefire (in Gaza). It wants to be a particularly strong leader on this issue, at least rhetorically,\u201d according to Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, speaking ahead of the meeting. \u201cChina has chosen to side with Palestine and the Arab countries. The choice is deliberate as it does suggest a desire to align with Arab countries, and the Global South. But China didn\u2019t create the crisis. It only capitalized on it,\u201d she added. Even as Beijing has sought to tighten ties throughout the Middle East in recent years, observers say its influence in the region remains limited. Beijing has also appeared unwilling to take certain steps to respond to regional effects of the conflict. For example, it said it did not deploy additional naval assets to secure Red Sea shipping lanes that were under attack in recent months by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Xi during his opening remarks pledged China will provide an additional nearly $70 million to alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to supporting post-conflict reconstruction, adding to roughly $14 million already contributed, as well as $3 million to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in support of its emergency humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Thursday\u2019s ministerial meeting\u00a0is the first such gathering since China held its first joint summit with Arab leaders in late 2022 in Saudi Arabia. Then, Xi was welcomed to the Gulf state with fanfare \u2013 cutting a sharp contrast to a tense visit from US President Joe Biden earlier that year amid American\u00a0outrage over Riyadh\u2019s alleged role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside its consulate in Istanbul. Xi and other top Chinese officials also held bilateral talks with visiting leaders this week, and announced that China would hold the second China-Arab States Summit in 2026.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/china/xi-jinping-arab-leaders-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_americas_haiti-david-natalie-lloyd-bodies-returned-intl", "text": "The first US commercial flight to Haitian capital Port-au-Prince in months made a bleak roundtrip on Thursday morning, returning with the bodies of a young American couple who were killed by a gang last week. The remains of Davy and Natalie Lloyd were accompanied in an American Airlines jet by US Ambassador to Haiti Dennis Hankins and US security agents, according to a source with knowledge of the operation. After flying from Haiti to Miami, they will be sent onward to their families. \u201cThis morning, the remains of Davy and Natalie Lloyd safely took off on a flight back to the United States \u2014 there will be a series of layovers, and they will safely reach Neosho, Missouri tomorrow afternoon,\u201d read a statement posted by their families on the X account of Natalie\u2019s father, Missouri State Rep. Ben Baker, requesting privacy during the transfer. \u201cWe are praising the Lord for his hand of protection over this nightmare. Funeral services will be early next week, with more details to come tomorrow,\u201d the statement also said. Their return follows a week of extraordinary negotiation between the US government and Haitian authorities, local organizations and even gang leaders, sources say \u2013 all in a city crippled by the criminal groups that have shut off the import of vital humanitarian supplies, destroyed medical facilities and blocked key roads. A State Department spokesperson told CNN that it had been working \u201caround the clock\u201d to assist in arranging the return, and on Thursday afternoon confirmed that both bodies had arrived in the United States. This month\u2019s reopening of Toussaint Louverture International Airport \u2013 a former target for coordinated gang attacks \u2013 marks an important step in connecting Haiti\u2019s capital city to the rest of the world, after months of violence in the gang-ravaged Caribbean nation. Local carrier Sunrise resumed flights earlier in May. But the progress has been overshadowed by last week\u2019s killing of three missionaries \u2013 the Lloyds and Haitian mission director Jude Montis \u2013 in a high-profile incident that attracted the close attention of US officials and the White House. The three were attacked in the early evening at the Missions in Haiti church and orphanage compound in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Lizon neighborhood, in what began as an armed robbery by one gang that left their compound rampaged and their supplies and aid stolen. A second gang later arrived on the scene and came under fire, precipitating a deadly retribution against mission staff, according to Davy Lloyd\u2019s father and Missions in Haiti founder David Lloyd, who was on the phone with his son that evening. Montis and the Lloyds barricaded themselves inside their residence on the compound, but it was not enough, Lloyd told CNN. Missions in Haiti\u00a0announced their deaths that night. US officials mobilize to recover bodies In the frantic hours following the attack, staffers from the office of Missouri US Rep. Eric Burlison, Missouri US\u00a0Sen. Josh Hawley\u00a0and the US National Security Council reached out to the State Department and US Embassy in Haiti. \u201cAs soon as I found out about the situation, we immediately reached out to the State Department to try and get assistance. Unfortunately, aid was not able to get there in time to prevent the tragedy,\u201d Burlison said in a statement to CNN. \u201cSince their murder we\u2019ve been working closely with Sen. Hawley\u2019s office, State Department, and airlines to bring them home to their families,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to thank everyone who is helping in these efforts.\u201d Natalie Lloyd\u2019s mother, Naomi Baker, is a staffer in Burlison\u2019s office and her father, Ben Baker, is a state representative in Missouri. After the shock of the deaths, it became clear early on Friday morning that Davy and Natalie\u2019s bodies needed to be recovered urgently \u2013 an operation that would be carefully orchestrated by the US government, according to multiple sources. There was no time to spare. \u201cThe bodies could have been either desecrated or kidnapped,\u201d one person involved in the operation told CNN. \u201cSo we pulled them out of a crime scene.\u201d The family of Davy Lloyd contacted private ambulance service HERO Client Rescue to retrieve the bodies on Friday morning, according to a HERO staffer who requested anonymity due to concerns for their safety. The rescue group agreed to coordinate the mission and kept the US embassy updated on it, the staffer also said. But attempts to reach the site were blocked in the road by armed gang members, according to a source with knowledge of the situation, who told CNN that there was an extraordinary intervention by US officials in Haiti, who quickly acted to broker negotiations between multiple gangs in the area to clear access to the bodies. On a phone call with multiple gang leaders, Vitel\u2019homme Innocent \u2013 a gang leader whose armed group Kraze Bary\u00e9 was not involved in the attacks but controls an area around the US embassy \u2013 asserted a claim to the bodies of the two Americans. \u201cFollowing the call, I did everything possible to communicate with the people in control of the area, to get access to retrieve their bodies,\u201d Innocent told CNN. He added, \u201cIt was a sad story when I learned that a Haitian and two Americans who came to serve the population died in a terrible situation.\u201d Innocent himself is the subject of a $2 million bounty for alleged kidnappings of American citizens, which he disputes, saying he hopes to defend himself one day. Emergency vehicles were soon allowed to continue onward to the charred site where they found the three bodies. The remains of Davy, 23, and Natalie Lloyd,\u00a021, were ultimately transferred to a local hospital morgue for safekeeping, according to HERO. Sources involved in the operation told CNN that inspection of the bodies revealed signs of blunt force trauma and severe burns on Davy, but no apparent bullet wounds. To remove human remains from a crime scene is a significant breach of protocol, even in a city plagued by lawlessness. However, Haitian officials agreed to inspect the remains after they were relocated, a source told CNN. Haiti\u2019s National Police did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment for this story, but in a statement last week, police spokesperson Gary Desrosiers told CNN that authorities would work with international law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the killings. Farewell to the bodies Missions in Haiti director Jude Montis, 45, was laid to rest in Port-au-Prince this week.\u00a0Local press showed large crowds gathered outside the church where his funeral services were held, and a mournful band in the procession could later be seen following his hearse down the street. But the bodies of the Lloyds have been waiting to travel back to Missouri until now. Natalie\u2019s father Ben Baker described the continuing hurdles to bring back his daughter and son-in-law on his Facebook page, in a message signed by Baker\u2019s spokesperson Cassidy Anderson. \u201cCurrently, we are working to retrieve the bodies of Natalie and Davy. We have to obtain a waiver that will allow their bodies to be transported without being fully embalmed due to the lack of facilities that provide that service in Haiti. After that, we have to find an airline that will be willing to do the transport. Prayers that this will all go smoothly,\u201d it read. The last remaining hospital in Port-au-Prince with the resources to perform the embalming would be the General Hospital near Champ de Mars, sources told CNN \u2013 but urban warfare between gangs and police have turned the iconic downtown park area into a volatile no-man\u2019s land. Waiting for news of the bodies\u2019 safe return has strained the nerves of family and supporters  with Hawley over the weekend releasing a public letter demanding that the Biden administration assure their security. \u201cNatalie and Davy\u2019s bodies will need to be transported to the final point of departure, and until that time, there are major risks. The situation on the ground in Port-au-Prince remains anarchic,\u201d he warned. But Thursday morning, the bodies of Davy and Natalie Lloyd finally began their long journey home. This is a developing story and has been updated. Correction: This article has been updated to clarify that American Airlines conducted the first US commercial flight to Port-au-Prince since violence erupted earlier this year.

Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Five people were arrested for invading the pitch and the \u201cmajority of others for attempts to breach security,\u201d the police force said in a statement. The pitch invasion occurred during the first minute of the game between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. Footage of the incident shows Borussia Dortmund midfielder Marcel Sabitzer helping to stop one of the invaders from running around the pitch. A spokesperson for Wembley Stadium condemned the pitch invaders. \u201cIt is illegal to enter the field of play at Wembley Stadium, and we strongly condemn the actions of those who interrupted the UEFA Champions League Final shortly after kick-off,\u201d a Wembley Stadium spokesperson said in a statement issued Saturday. \u201cAll of the individuals have now been arrested. We will support the relevant authorities to ensure appropriate action is taken,\u201d the Wembley Stadium spokesperson added. While five people were arrested in connection with the pitch invasion, Metropolitan Police Commander Louise Puddefoot said in a statement that most of the arrests were for attempts to breach security, as some fans had tried to force their way into the stadium. \u201cWe are confident that the overwhelming majority of attempts to unlawfully gain access to Wembley this evening were unsuccessful thanks to the efforts of officers, stewards and other stadium staff,\u201d Commander Puddefoot said. \u201cThere is a robust policing operation in place to support the Wembley security plan and officers have worked closely with stewards and stadium staff to maintain security throughout. \u201cVideos shared online showing groups running into entrances do not necessarily represent successful attempts to enter the stadium. There are typically multiple further levels of security beyond an initial entrance.\u201d UEFA has not responded to CNN\u2019s requests for more information on the situation.

{"id": "2024_05_30_tech_elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap", "text": "The most important carmaker in the world right now is the Chinese-owned, Warren Buffett-backed company that has Elon Musk in a pickle. BYD, a carmaker Musk once laughed at, overtook Tesla at the end of last year as the top seller of electric vehicles on the planet (Tesla overtook it in the first quarter of this year, but they\u2019re neck and neck). And now it\u2019s giving Toyota a run for its money, unveiling a new hybrid powertrain that BYD says is capable of taking you from New York to Miami without refueling. That\u2019s 1,300 miles in one go \u2014 hundreds of miles beyond the standard ranges for other hybrids on the market. According to The Wall Street Journal, ranges of major global hybrid carmakers typically top out just above 680 miles. BYD\u2019s Hong Kong shares shot up more than 5% on Wednesday. There are a few reasons why all of that matters. One: Tesla is America\u2019s best-selling EV, but it\u2019s losing market share overseas to foreign competitors that can make their cars cheaper. And while Tesla is an EV pioneer, it hasn\u2019t rolled out any significant innovations in recent years that would help justify its loftier price point. That\u2019s why BYD \u2014 which makes both EVs and hybrids \u2014 is now eating Tesla\u2019s lunch on the global stage. China is the world\u2019s biggest auto market, and BYD is its top seller, surpassing Volkswagen last year. On top of all that, BYD\u2019s sedans are cheap. The two models that will boast the new drivetrain start at around $14,000. (For comparison, the best-selling hybrid in the US, the Toyota Prius, starts at $28,000.) BYD\u2019s evolution from a small producer of clunkers to a global powerhouse brand has surprised its skeptics, including Musk, who roundly dismissed BYD in a 2011 Bloomberg interview. In that exchange, Musk responds to an honest question about BYD rivaling Tesla with a smug laugh. \u201cHave you seen their car?\u201d he asks the interviewer rhetorically. When the reporter presses him, he clarifies that he thinks BYD\u2019s product is not \u201cparticularly attractive\u201d and that the technology is \u201cnot very strong.\u201d Of course, a lot happened in the decade that followed, and Musk ate his words this January, saying on an earnings call that he believes Chinese EV makers could \u201cpretty much demolish most other car companies in the world\u201d unless stronger trade barriers are put in place. (They were two weeks ago.) Meanwhile, BYD has another edge that Tesla lacks: It makes hybrids. Hybrid cars like the Prius were supposed to be the short-lived stepping stone to our all-electric future. But in the United States, at least, EV sales are flagging in part because the nation\u2019s roads lack the infrastructure to support them. EV ranges have come a long way \u2014 most get more than 300 miles of range per charge, which is more than most people would drive before stopping even in a traditional car. Problem is, we don\u2019t have enough charging stations along the roads or within cities to make customers comfortable with the idea. The top reason US customers won\u2019t consider an EV \u2014 cited by 52% of consumers in a recent JD Power survey \u2014 is lack of charging station availability. Instead, we\u2019re buying more hybrids, which are largely cheaper than EVs, reduce the cost of fuel over the long term and are ever so slightly better for the environment than regular engines. (Emphasis on slightly\u2026 Hybrids still run on fossil fuels, they\u2019re not doing much to help the world meet its climate goals the way mass adoption of EVs would.) For now, Tesla and other US carmakers are being thoroughly shielded from Chinese competition via strict tariffs and major regulatory hurdles. But it\u2019s not clear how long those protections will hold if American consumers begin demanding the cheaper options available overseas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/tech/elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_china_shangrila-dialogue-us-china-defense-chiefs-meeting-intl-hnk", "text": "US and Chinese defense chiefs held rare talks in Singapore Friday touching on a host of fractious issues including Taiwan and China\u2019s relationship with Russia as well as frictions in the South China Sea as the two powers navigate a contentious security landscape across the Asia-Pacific. The meeting, between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and China\u2019s Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun, is the first face-to-face talks between the two defense chiefs and Austin\u2019s first such discussions with a Chinese counterpart since late 2022. The meeting, on the sidelines of an annual defense conference in Singapore, takes place against a fraught regional backdrop. Beijing \u2013 which wields the world\u2019s largest navy \u2013 continues to aggressively assert disputed territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, while decrying Washington\u2019s efforts to strengthen security ties with key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. At the core of those contentions is that China does not want to see America exercise its military power in Asia \u2013 a region where the US it has deep, historic security ties and seeks to maintain open waterways and deter North Korean aggression, but where China is widely viewed as wanting to establish its dominance. A deterioration of US-China military dialogue in recent years raised international concerns about those tensions leading to miscommunications that could veer toward conflict. In their roughly 75 minute meeting, both Austin and Dong nodded to their interests in maintaining dialogue, while also pressing each other on key issues, according to statements from each sides. Austin raised concerns about \u201crecent provocative\u201d Chinese military activity around the Taiwan Strait and China\u2019s \u201crole in supporting Russia\u2019s defense industrial base,\u201d according to a readout from Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. The US defense chief also \u201cmade clear\u201d that the US would continue its operations \u201csafely and responsibly\u201d wherever international law allows \u2013 in an apparent pushback on China\u2019s aggressive patrolling of international waters and airspace in the region. Austin\u2019s counterpart said the \u201cstabilization\u201d of the military-to-military relations \u201cdoes not come by easily and shall be cherished dearly,\u201d Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian, told reporters after the meeting, adding that Dong stressed that neither side should \u201ccontain or smear\u201d the other side, but build mutual trust. Dong also said that when it comes to areas surrounding China, especially the South China Sea, commercial ships and aircraft \u201ccan always operate safely,\u201d but that \u201cthere is a huge difference between freedom and willfulness, between navigation and trespassing.\u201d \u201cIt is important to respect others\u2019 security concerns, and security should be mutually respected. No one can pursue one\u2019s security at the expense of another country\u2019s security,\u201d Dong said, according to the ministry spokesperson. Regional tensions The two leaders spoke following a period of weeks where regional tensions have been on show. China earlier this month staged major war games around Taiwan following the inauguration of the island\u2019s new democratically elected president Lai Ching-te. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it. Its Coast Guard in recent weeks has also fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas of the South China Sea, stoking already heightened tensions with a US treaty ally in the region. Beijing has also lashed out at what it sees as provocative moves between the US and its allies, as it conducts joint military exercises in the region. Austin in his talks with Dong reiterated the US call for China not to \u201cuse Taiwan\u2019s political transition\u2014part of a normal, routine democratic process\u2014as a pretext for coercive measures,\u201d the Pentagon statement said. Dong, meanwhile, slammed the US for offering a congratulatory message for Lai, calling on it to take \u201cconcrete actions to correct its mistakes,\u201d according to China\u2019s account. Dong also condemned the deployment of an\u00a0American missile system\u00a0during military drills in the Philippines last month as a \u201cthreat to regional security,\u201d and accused Manila of being \u201cemboldened by outside powers,\u201d according to Wu. \u201cOur tolerance for continued and intensified provocations will have a limit,\u201d the spokesperson quoted Dong as saying in reference to the Philippines. China claims historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea, despite a 2016 ruling at an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines against that claim. The two sides also discussed Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, with Austin indicating to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily, a senior US defense official said after the meeting. The US defense chief \u201csaid quite clearly that if China\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s defense sector continues than the United States, with our allies, will have to take further measures,\u201d the official said, while declining to detail what those measures would be. Washington in recent weeks has said dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia\u2019s defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine and have warned Chinese counterparts against providing lethal aid. Dong said China, which claims neutrality in the conflict, had \u201chonored our promise not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict\u201d and has strict controls on dual-use exports, according to China\u2019s spokesperson. Austin also discussed US concerns about China\u2019s nuclear buildup and cyber attacks on US critical infrastructure, a second US defense official said. Severed ties The sit-down in Singapore follows a call last month between Austin and Dong, who was appointed to his post in late December. The call marked Austin\u2019s first at-length conversation with a Chinese counterpart since November 2022. Beijing had largely suspended high-level military communications following a visit in August of that year from then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which sparked Beijing\u2019s ire. The silence coincided with a period of significant tensions between the two powers, which included high-profile incidents such as a Chinese spy balloon traversing across the continental US and what the US described as an increase in \u201ccoercive and risky\u201d behavior by Chinese pilots against US aircraft over the East and South China Seas. US efforts to re-engage appeared further complicated by the appointment in early 2023 of China\u2019s previous Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who had been sanctioned by the US in 2018 over China\u2019s purchase of Russian weapons. Austin and Li had a brief exchange during last year\u2019s Shangri-La Dialogue, but no formal talks, with Beijing repeatedly suggesting that the US defense secretary won\u2019t get a meeting with Li unless the sanctions were revoked. Efforts to stabilize that communication hit another complication after Li abruptly vanished from the public eye last August amid a personnel shake-up in Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s military ranks. Li was formally removed from his post without explanation in October and replaced by Dong, a former naval commander, some two months later.\u00a0\u00a0In China, the defense minister is a largely ceremonial role, serving as the public face of military diplomacy with other countries, while command power resides within the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s powerful Central Military Commission led by Xi. Xi and US President Joe Biden had vowed to restore high-level military talks during a summit outside San Francisco in November, seen by both sides as a key step in stabilizing fractious relations. Several weeks later, US and Chinese top generals spoke in a video call, paving the way for this week\u2019s in-person meeting between the defense chiefs. Following Friday\u2019s meeting, a US defense official said the US side had pressed for calls between China\u2019s five theater commanders in the region and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo, adding that those calls could happen soon but had not been scheduled. Austin also referenced plans to convene a crisis-communications working group by the end of the year, the Pentagon readout said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/china/shangrila-dialogue-us-china-defense-chiefs-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_africa_south-africa-election-results-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress party has lost its majority for the first time in 30 years after national elections this week, marking the biggest political shift in the country since the end of apartheid. Nelson Mandela\u2019s party suffered a seismic blow at the polls, final election results announced on Sunday confirmed. Support for the ANC dropped to 40.18%, a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election in 2019. The official opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), received 21.8% of the vote. Former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) had nearly 14.59% of the vote. Another ANC splinter party \u2013 the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 had nearly 10%, with results at 9.52% The blow to the ANC comes after\u00a0years of corruption scandals and economic mismanagement.\u00a0\u00a0As a result,\u00a0the ANC will be forced to form a coalition to govern\u00a0the world\u2019s most unequal country. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa and the ANC \u2013 and once Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. But many feel those promises never\u00a0materialized\u00a0and the\u00a0election\u00a0results reflect\u00a0a population deeply frustrated with the country\u2019s direction. South Africans could now face weeks of political uncertainty, as the ANC seeks to strike a coalition deal with former rivals. \u201cOur people have spoken, whether we like it or not they have spoken,\u201d Ramaphosa told an audience after the official results were announced. He added that the voices of the people had been \u201cheard\u201d and \u201cwe must respect their choices and their wishes.\u201d The\u00a0rebuke to the ANC\u00a0was hardly unexpected,\u00a0mirroring widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling party.\u00a0But the scale of the losses surprised some. \u201cWhat we have seen is voters are unhappy with the ANC\u2019s recent history. In particular\u00a0what happened in the Zuma years and what followed on from that,\u201d analyst and former ANC MP Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. There has been \u201ca general arrogance and loss of connection with the general voter from the ANC side,\u201d Verwoerd said, adding that parties like MK and the EFF have capitalized on\u00a0that discontent. Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to\u00a0resign as leader in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court.\u00a0The Constitutional Court barred the\u00a082-year-old\u00a0from running for parliament\u00a0in May, but\u00a0his face remained on the MK party ballot. The results from Wednesday\u2019s poll were officially announced despite protests from Zuma and his MK party. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a recount. We want a total revote,\u201d the party\u2019s spokesperson Nhlamulo Ndhlela said Saturday evening. Zuma told a press briefing the party wanted a chance to present its case before the results were announced. South Africa\u2019s electoral commission had already extended the deadline for submissions of objections and appeals to 6 p.m. local time on Saturday. It received more than 500 objections. ANC in uncharted territory Substantial bargaining for the coalition government will now begin.\u00a0Political parties will have two weeks to form a coalition before a new parliament must convene to elect the nation\u2019s president.\u00a0If they fail, new elections will need to be held. ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula admitted Sunday there was \u201cnothing to celebrate\u201d following the party\u2019s blow at the polls. \u201cWe wish to assure the people of South Africa that we have heard them. We have heard their concerns, their frustrations and their dissatisfaction,\u201d Mbalula told a media briefing. However, he warned potential coalition partners if they demand party leader Ramaphosa must step down \u201cthis is not going to happen.\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told CNN during an interview at the election\u2019s National Results Center that he had \u201cno sympathy for Mr. Ramaphosa and his party.\u201d \u201cIt is their spinelessness to deal with the prospect of Mr. Zuma and his sins of omission and commission that has led to him being a political force now that has come and wiped them out in places like KwaZulu-Natal and other parts of the country.\u201d The populous coastal eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the major city of Durban is located and which is Zuma\u2019s home province, has traditionally been a stronghold of the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). This time around, the MK party earned almost 46% of the provincial vote, but failed to get a majority and will be forced to find a coalition partner if it wants to govern the province. Zuma has faced\u00a0hundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u00a0over the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he has faced and weathered. Analysts CNN spoke to, including Verwoerd,\u00a0believe the most likely coalition is between the ANC and DA. But others are more sceptical of that outcome.\u00a0They all agree that the country is in uncharted territory. Steenhuisen told CNN he wants to be part of a governing coalition and he believes a coalition \u201ccan work.\u201d Before\u00a0the election, the DA had already formed a\u00a0bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. What he labels a \u201cdoomsday coalition\u201d is one of the other options on the table: a deal between the ANC-EFF\u00a0or\u00a0even\u00a0the\u00a0MK. But with such disdain inside those breakaway parties for\u00a0Ramaphosa, it would be quite some negotiation. The EFF is led by\u00a0former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It espouses the expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism.\u00a0The MK party\u2019s manifesto\u00a0holds\u00a0broadly\u00a0similar ideas and demands\u00a0an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution\u00a0to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Not since the dawn of democracy in 1994 has South Africa\u2019s political landscape been so unclear. But\u00a0some analysts believe \u2013 despite the uncertainty \u2013\u00a0that\u00a0the results of this election could be a win for democracy. \u201cIt\u00a0is probably a maturity in the democracy, we needed change and it is never good to have such a one-party dominance in a country,\u201d Verwoerd said. \u201cIt might be a little bit more unstable as we go into the future. But for\u00a0democracy\u2019s\u00a0sake, it is most probably a good thing.\u201d Ramaphosa appeared to make a similar point in his post results speech, saying the announcement \u201cin many ways represents a victory for our democracy as South Africans. It also represents a victory of our constitutional order\u201d and a \u201cvictory for all the people of South Africa.\u201d Verwoerd said that the ANC\u2019s prospects dropped dramatically under the previous president. \u201cOnce the Jacob Zuma years happened, it became pretty inevitable that there was going to be a slide,\u201d she added. A country going backwards The ANC swept to power in 1994 on a\u00a0pledge\u00a0to \u201cbuild a better life for all,\u201d winning almost 63% of the vote in the country\u2019s first democratic election. Fast forward three decades and rampant corruption, soaring joblessness, crippling\u00a0power cuts,\u00a0and feeble economic growth are severely impacting South Africans. The economy has gone backward over the past decade, evidenced by a sharp fall in living standards. According to the\u00a0World Bank, gross domestic product per capita has fallen from a peak in 2011, leaving the average South African 23% poorer. South Africa has the highest rate of unemployment in the world, according to\u00a0the\u00a0World Bank. \u00a0Inequality is also the world\u2019s worst. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Any coalition government will\u00a0be a bitter pill to swallow for the ANC and Ramaphosa,\u00a0who could soon be fighting for his political life. Leading analysts believe that the ANC was depending on its legacy too much. \u201cThe ANC was campaigning on three decades of its existence. But nobody was looking at the current president,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance in Johannesburg. He believes Ramaphosa is \u201cunder pressure\u201d. \u201cHistorically, it is an embarrassment for him. He always styles himself as the next Nelson Mandela,\u201d Pooe told CNN. But \u201clast recollection, Nelson Mandela never lost an election.\u201d Pooe said, with this election, voters have told the ANC three things: \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d Whether a coalition government can deliver for the people is deeply uncertain, but one thing is clear:\u00a0South Africa and the ANC \u2013 Mandela\u2019s former liberation movement that triumphed over apartheid \u2013 will never be the same.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/africa/south-africa-election-results-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_asia_us-defense-chief-austin-shangrila-intl-hnk", "text": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday hailed the arrival of a \u201cnew convergence\u201d in the Indo-Pacific, as the United States fortifies\u00a0strategic and security partnerships in the region amid rising threats from China and Russia. \u201cToday, we are witnessing a new convergence around nearly all aspects of security in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Austin said at the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore. \u201cThis new convergence is producing a stronger, more resilient, and more capable network of partnerships. And that is defining a new era of security in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d The new convergence is not \u201ca single alliance or coalition,\u201d but instead \u201ca set of overlapping and complementary initiatives and institutions, propelled by both a shared vision and a shared sense of mutual obligation,\u201d Austin said. Looming large in that regional vision is a more assertive China, which Austin alluded to without mentioning it by name. The convergence, he said, is not about \u201cimposing one country\u2019s will\u201d or \u201cbullying or coercion,\u201d but common principles and beliefs including \u201cthe peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue \u2013 not coercion or conflict. And certainly not through so-called punishment.\u201d The remark appeared to be a thinly veiled reference to China\u2019s military drills around Taiwan last week, which Beijing said was a \u201cstrong punishment\u201d for the self-ruled island\u2019s \u201cseparatist acts.\u201d The massive show of force came just days after Taiwan swore in its new democratically elected leader Lai Ching-te, who called on Beijing to\u00a0cease its intimidation tactics. Austin said the new convergence helped the US make \u201chistoric progress\u201d in the past three years. \u201cWe\u2019ve strengthened stability on the Korean Peninsula. We\u2019ve supported the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. And we\u2019ve stood up for the rule of law in the South China Sea,\u201d he said. Under President Joe Biden, the US has bolstered ties with allies and like-minded partners in the Asia-Pacific region to counter a rising China, which under leader Xi Jinping has become increasingly\u00a0assertive\u00a0and belligerent about its many maritime and\u00a0territorial claims in the region \u2013 from Taiwan to the East and South China Seas. That bolstering of US ties has infuriated Beijing, which accuses Washington of leading a campaign of \u201cencirclement and suppression\u201d of China. Austin\u2019s emphasis on a \u201cnew convergence\u201d in Asia-Pacific appeared to have struck a raw nerve with the Chinese delegation in the audience. In the Q&A session, a Chinese colonel asked Austin whether the US is planning to build a NATO-like alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region, and blamed NATO for the Ukraine war. \u201cThe eastern border expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis. What implications do you think the straightening of the US alliances system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region\u2019s security and stability?\u201d asked Cao Yanzhong, a\u00a0senior colonel\u00a0and\u00a0researcher\u00a0at the\u00a0Institute\u00a0of\u00a0War Studies\u00a0of the Academy\u00a0of\u00a0Military Sciences of the Chinese military. \u201cI respectfully disagree with your point that the expansion of NATO caused the Ukraine crisis,\u201d Austin replied, drawing a rare round of applause from the audience. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because (Russian President) Mr (Vladimir) Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor.\u201d The exchange came a day after Austin held his first face-to-face talks with China\u2019s Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun on the sidelines of the defense forum. The rare talks between the US and Chinese defense chiefs touched on a host of fractious issues including Taiwan and China\u2019s relationship with Russia, as well as frictions in the South China Sea. On Saturday, Austin mentioned the meeting with Dong in his speech, saying they had a \u201cfrank discussion.\u201d \u201cThere is no substitute for direct military-to-military talks between senior leaders. And there\u2019s no substitute for open lines of communication to avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations,\u201d he said, adding that he looked forward to more talks with China. Austin also reiterated US commitment to its defense treaty with the Philippines, calling it \u201cironclad.\u201d Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr on Friday denounced illegal, coercive and aggressive actions in the South China Sea at the opening of the defense forum, saying peace, stability and prosperity in the waters was being undermined by other actors, without naming China. Austin also reaffirmed US commitment to the Asia-Pacific region, saying peace and stability across the region are crucial for the whole world. \u201cThe United States can be secure only if Asia is secure. That\u2019s why the United States has long maintained our presence in this region. And that\u2019s why we continue to make the investments necessary to meet our commitments to our allies and partners,\u201d he said. Hours after Austin\u00a0reaffirmed America\u2019s commitment to the Indo-Pacific, a Chinese military spokesman accused the United States of \u201ccreating division and provoking confrontation.\u201d \u201cThe US keeps creating chaos and has become the source of risks, as well as the destroyer to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Jing Jianfeng, Deputy Chief of the Joint Staff Department at China\u2019s Central Military Commission, told a group of reporters in Singapore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/asia/us-defense-chief-austin-shangrila-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Young adults will be able to choose between spending one weekend a month volunteering over the course of a year, or take up one of 30,000 spaces to spend a year in the armed forces, Sunak said. The announcement followed Labour Party leader Keir Starmer\u2019s comments on Saturday that he was in favour of allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote. Sunak\u2019s Conservatives\u00a0lag Labour\u00a0by a wide margin in opinion polls, which have shown little change in fortunes for the prime minister since his surprise election call last Wednesday. \u201cBritain today faces a future that is more dangerous and more divided. There\u2019s no doubt that our democratic values are under threat. That is why we will introduce a bold new model of national service for 18-year-olds,\u201d Sunak said in a statement. The Conservative Party said the proposal would be funded by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion, and by diverting money from the\u00a0UK\u00a0Shared Prosperity Fund, which existed to reduce regional economic inequality. Labour politicians derided the announcement. \u201cThe national service we need from our young people is to vote for change on July 4,\u201d said Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester. Interior minister James Cleverly told broadcasters there would be no criminal sanctions for skipping mandatory service but that people will be compelled to do it, without providing further details. Asked by the BBC if forcing adults to volunteer was at odds with the Conservative Party\u2019s liberal tradition, Cleverly said: \u201cWe force people to do things all the time.\u201d He cited compulsory education or training for teenagers until the age of 18 as an example.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/europe/national-service-britain-uk-sunak-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_india_india-narendra-modi-meditation-island-election-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on his way to meditate inside an island shrine for two days to cap weeks of election campaigning \u2013 his latest public display of religiosity days after proclaiming he was sent by god. India\u2019s election is the world\u2019s largest, a mammoth exercise in democracy that has taken place over six weeks. The final day of voting takes place on Saturday and results will be announced three days later. Modi will visit the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, a pilgrimage site off India\u2019s southernmost tip, from May 30 to June 1, according to Indian state broadcaster DD News. The site is where popular Hindu monk and philosopher Swami Vivekananda attained enlightenment. Modi has twice before ended an election campaign with meditation. But he has recently been making increasingly grand displays of piety, to capitalize on Hindu-nationalist sentiment as he eyes a third consecutive five-year term in power. In an interview last week with local news channel NDTV, Modi said: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that God has sent me for a purpose, and when that purpose is finished, my work will be done.\u201d \u201cGod doesn\u2019t reveal his cards. He just keeps making me do things,\u201d he continued. India is constitutionally bound to secularism, but since assuming power in 2014 Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have promoted a strident brand of Hindu nationalism that has deepened religious divides. When he first contested national elections a decade ago, Modi chose India\u2019s spiritual capital Varanasi as his constituency, making the ancient city the perfect backdrop to meld his religious and political ambitions. At the end of that campaign, Modi visited Pratapgad in the western state of Maharashtra, where the Hindu-led Maratha forces won a historic battle against the Mughal empire army in the 17th century. Toward the end of the 2019 national elections, which he also won, Modi went to meditate in the revered Kedarnath shrine dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Shiva high in the Himalayas. In January, just months before campaigning began, Modi consecrated the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple that was built on the site of a destroyed mosque, taking on a role typically reserved for priests. In a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith, critics say Modi\u2019s brandishing of Hinduism has led to rising Islamophobia and persecution of the country\u2019s more than 200 million Muslims. Modi and the\u00a0BJP have increasingly resorted to overtly Islamophobic language during his recent election speeches. In a controversial speech last month, Modi said that if the opposition wins, they would distribute the country\u2019s wealth among \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and \u201cthose who have more children,\u201d in apparent reference to the Muslim community.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/india/india-narendra-modi-meditation-island-election-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

An explosion. But as the\u00a010-year-old\u00a0younger son of Larisa and Mykola Glushko staggered in the dark,\u00a0toward\u00a0his mother\u2019s room, he\u00a0realized\u00a0he was awake, and that his mother lay before him, crushed beneath a collapsed concrete baton. \u201cSomething\u00a0fell,\u201d\u00a0he recalled.\u00a0\u201cMom\u00a0was saying, \u2018Kolya, Kolya.\u2019 I\u00a0shouted,\u00a0\u2018Mom, I\u2019m alive.\u2019\u201d He said he frantically scraped the dust from his face and eyes. \u201cI saw my\u00a0Mom crushed down by the ceiling. I tried to pull it\u00a0away,\u00a0but I couldn\u2019t.\u00a0Mom was moaning and shaking her legs. And I was\u00a0shouting,\u00a0\u2018Mother, mother, it\u2019s just a dream, a horrible dream.\u2019\u201d Mykola had a similar nightmare days earlier, and felt it might be recurring. \u201cThen there was darkness.\u201d His mother died in front of him. His father was killed by the initial explosion. Hours earlier, the family had a barbecue, and Mykola senior drank one beer too many and talked passionately about enlisting. In the pitch black, his son clambered outside, the front of their comfortable family home beyond recognition, its gates torn clean away. Mykola said: \u201cI was\u00a0screaming,\u00a0\u2018God, why did you do this to\u00a0me?\u2019\u00a0I was running in underwear asking for help.\u201d For Mykola, the act of survival stretches what any\u00a010-year-old\u00a0could be expected to\u00a0bear. His\u00a0loss,\u00a0part of a patina of suffering across Ukraine\u2019s two years of war, where Russian missiles that slammed inexplicably into civilian targets, claim lives that do not make the headlines, and unravel childhoods in ways that will echo for decades in Ukraine. Mykola was given a shot\u00a0of medicine\u00a0to calm him in\u00a0hospital,\u00a0and his brother came to explain what had happened. \u201cHe told me now it\u2019s only me and him left. He repeated it four times. I was trying to calm myself down, but also hated myself. Because I couldn\u2019t save my mom.\u201d He\u00a0has spoken\u00a0with his new guardian, his godmother,\u00a0who lives\u00a0nearby,\u00a0and is\u00a0clear he will stay\u00a0in the military town of Pokrovsk to tend their graves. \u201cI will visit them,\u201d he said. \u201c(I will)\u00a0apologize for not able to save them. Will apologize to my father that I couldn\u2019t save my mom, his wife.\u201d He\u00a0said\u00a0his dream now is\u00a0different, to ask his\u00a0parents\u00a0important questions.\u00a0\u201cWhat should I do now? How do I live? Another dream is to take revenge on the one who launched the missile.\u201d Across the\u00a0eastern frontline, notably\u00a0around Pokrovsk, the\u00a0pace of Russia\u2019s advance appears to quicken, and with it the unspeakable loss of families like Mykola\u2019s. At the ruins of his home,\u00a0neighbors\u00a0said\u00a0there is no military target nearby. Workers\u00a0sifted\u00a0through the dust. The smell of the decaying family dog lingered. On a nearby radio, Russians are so close their\u00a0stations\u00a0were\u00a0audible, explaining to their audience how the West refuses to give Ukraine modern equipment and so \u201cthe ordinary boys from Ukrainian armed forces will be the ones to suck it up.\u201d A short drive away, at a\u00a0stabilization\u00a0point in an\u00a0eastern town, the life-changing hideousness of even light injuries\u00a0wasapparent. Sunset means frontline units can begin the task of evacuating their wounded, safe from the Russian attack drones that haunt daylight hours. The medical point\u00a0waited\u00a0in complete darkness, and a car\u00a0raced\u00a0out from the night. Two wounded soldiers from\u00a0Klishchiivka\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a town where Moscow has recently claimed success, partially owing to Ukraine having to relocate forces from there to defend against the onslaught in Kharkiv region\u00a0\u2013\u00a0emerged\u00a0from the car. One has his head fully bandaged up and talked,\u00a0his arms outstretched,\u00a0as\u00a0groped\u00a0his way\u00a0forward. The other\u00a0was laid\u00a0flat on a gurney. They\u00a0were\u00a0quickly tended to. Clothes\u00a0were\u00a0gently cut away. One had\u00a0damage to his eyes, swollen shut, yet appearedotherwise less badly hurt. The other had\u00a0shrapnel in his leg, flesh injuries to his arm, and\u00a0was\u00a0peppered with shrapnel on his back. His face\u00a0was\u00a0covered with dirt and his eyes also struggled\u00a0to open. A mortar landed about\u00a0four\u00a0feet\u00a0(1.2 meters)\u00a0from their dugout. It is a matter of luck and a few feet that they are still physically intact. The staff swiftly tried\u00a0to clean their eyes. \u201cWhen I open the eye like this, do you see the light?\u201d a\u00a0doctor asked. \u201cWhat about people?\u201d The patient could\u00a0only see light. A nurse noticed\u00a0damage to his right hand. They examined\u00a0his back and saw\u00a0a morass of tiny wounds. Suddenly, the patient worsened. \u201cSomething on my\u00a0side,\u201d\u00a0he screamed. It is possible the force of the blast caused internal injuries. The doctors moved\u00a0to quickly intervene. Anaesthetic\u00a0was\u00a0injected into his lung, and a tube inserted. \u201cCough, and it will get better,\u201d a doctor\u00a0told\u00a0the patient. Around the pair, there\u00a0were\u00a0four empty beds. A year ago, one doctor, Ivan, told\u00a0us, they could have 250 patients a day, when the Russian assault on Bakhmut was at its peak. Yet the drop in patients does not herald an improvement in Ukraine\u2019s war. The 93rd mechanized brigade lacks infantry, and finds it hard to resupply and position them on the frontline because of the threat of Russian drones, an official\u00a0told\u00a0us, and so this stabilization unit lacks patients. It is a chilling reminder of the manpower shortage Kyiv is dealing with after two years of war. The patients\u00a0were\u00a0led to a waiting ambulance, which\u00a0left\u00a0in the pitch black, its headlights off.

Pedestrian-friendly destinations Few things in life are as delightful as ambling around a new neighborhood in a new city, chancing upon cute stores, bars, eateries and public spaces. But decades of car-centric policies means lots of cities around the world lack an abundance of pedestrian-friendly streets, a new study called \u201cThe ABC of Mobility\u201d has found. The bigger and richer the city, the less likely it is to be easily walkable. But there are plenty of exceptions, as the stats from the study broken down by The Economist newspaper show. The Mozambique seaport of Quelimane, population 350,000, comes out as the most foot-friendly of the 794 cities surveyed in the study, but there are some less off-the-radar destinations in Europe (whose metropolises rank considerably higher than those of the United States). In the Netherlands, the tree-lined canals of Utrecht (No. 3) and the monumental splendor of The Hague (No. 27) are quieter alternatives to tourist favorite Amsterdam (No. 66). In northern Spain, the port city of Bilbao (No. 8) is famous for its Frank Gehry\u2013designed Guggenheim Museum, and Le\u00f3n (No. 9) boasts Roman ruins and Gothic cathedrals.

He was barred from standing in the 2017 election by the Guardian Council, a year after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned him that entering was \u201cnot in his interest and that of the country.\u201d A rift developed between the two after Ahmadinejad explicitly advocated checks on Khamenei\u2019s ultimate authority. In 2018, in rare criticism directed at Khamenei, Ahmadinejad wrote to him calling for \u201cfree\u201d elections. Khamenei had backed Ahmadinejad after his 2009 re-election triggered protests in which dozens of people were killed and hundreds arrested, rattling the ruling theocracy, before security forces led by the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) stamped out the unrest.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/middleeast/iran-ahmadinejad-to-run-in-presidential-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Biden unveiled on Friday what he said was a three-phase Israeli proposal to end the conflict in Gaza that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire.\u201d During a speech at the White House, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it could no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s time\u00a0for this war to end,\u201d he said, a clear indication that \u2013 as far as he is concerned \u2013 Israel\u2019s war goals have been met. But the Israeli government\u2019s two most prominent far-right members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, made it explicitly clear they reject an immediate ceasefire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also signaled he is not ready either, casting doubt over Biden\u2019s proposal. In a statement on social media, Smotrich said he had \u201cmade it clear\u201d to Netanyahu that he would not \u201cbe part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the hostages.\u201d Smotrich demanded the fighting to continue until the \u201cdestruction of Hamas and the return of all the hostages,\u201d as well as the \u201ccreation of a completely different security reality in Gaza and Lebanon.\u201d National Security Minister Ben Gvir meanwhile described the deal as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201ca victory for terrorism,\u201d as well as a security danger to Israel. \u201cIf the prime minister implements the reckless deal under the conditions published today, which mean the end of the war and the giving up on the elimination of Hamas, Otzma Yehudit will dissolve the government,\u201d he said, referring to the far-right party he leads and which helps prop up Netanyahu\u2019s majority in parliament. Biden had alluded to the tensions in the Israeli government in his speech, making a direct appeal to ordinary Israelis to voice their support. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,\u201d he said. Netanyahu under pressure The proposal would first see hostages freed and Israel withdrawing from \u201call populated areas of Gaza,\u201d and eventually culminate in a reconstruction plan for Gaza, which has been left in ruins from the fighting. The plan has been widely welcomed, with the UN and other international powers urging Israel and Hamas to accept it. Hamas said it viewed the plan \u201cpositively\u201d and was ready \u201cto deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.\u201d Less than an hour after Biden detailed the proposal, Netanyahu insisted Israel will not end the war in Gaza until it had achieved all of its goals, including the destruction of Hamas. The extent to which Netanyahu agrees with the plan is unclear, as the statement also said that the \u201cexact outline\u201d of Israel\u2019s proposal allows Israel to \u201cmaintain these\u00a0principles.\u201d On Sunday, the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant warned Israel will \u201cnot accept\u201d any deal to end the war which would allow Hamas to rule over Gaza. During a visit to the Israeli military\u2019s Southern Command headquarters on Sunday, Gallant said options for a \u201cgoverning alternative to Hamas\u201d are being considered. \u201cWe will not accept the rule of Hamas in Gaza at any stage in any process aimed at ending the war,\u201d Gallant said, according to a readout from his office. However, Hamas has made it clear it will not accept any other group governing Gaza. On May 16, the group\u2019s political leader Ismail Haniyeh noted that, in regards to \u201cthe day after the war,\u201d there had been \u201ccalls to remove Hamas.\u201d \u201cWe say that Hamas is here to stay,\u201d Haniyeh responded. On Sunday the White House National Security Council spokesperson John\u00a0Kirby said the administration was currently \u201cwaiting for an official response from Hamas\u201d on the Israeli ceasefire proposal. Pressed on whether there would be a situation in which Hamas would agree to the proposal but Israel would not, speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d Kirby said that the Biden administration has \u201cevery expectation\u201d that Israel would agree. \u201cWe have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal, as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal, that Israel would say yes,\u201d Kirby added. Netanyahu faces pressure from more than just within his own coalition. On Saturday protesters again took to the streets, demanding his resignation and early elections. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to back Netanyahu in accepting the proposal, and condemned the comments by Smotrich and Ben Gvir. \u201cThe threats of Ben Gvir and Smotrich are the neglect of national security, of the hostages and of the residents of the north and the south,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the worst and most reckless government in the country\u2019s history. For them, there will be a war here forever, zero responsibility, zero management, a complete failure. Netanyahu\u2019s government is facing growing international calls to end the war in Gaza as the conflict approaches its ninth month. The war was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage. The Israeli campaign in Gaza since then has killed more than 36,000 people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/middleeast/israeli-ministers-biden-ceasefire-plan-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_europe_kharkiv-russian-strike-hypermarket-ukraine-intl", "text": "At least 16 people have been killed and dozens injured after\u00a0a Russian strike hit a large hardware store in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Saturday, according to officials. Among the dead is a 12-year-old girl, police said Sunday. The attack came as Russian forces continue to advance in northeastern Ukraine after crossing the border earlier this month and opening a new front in the two-year-old conflict.  Kharkiv has seen a spate of Russian attacks, as Russia seeks to tie up Ukrainian forces elsewhere and create a buffer zone.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the strike a \u201cbrutal attack\u201d in a post on X, later writing that \u201cRussia is run by men who want to make it a norm \u2013 burning lives, destroying cities and villages, dividing people, and erasing national borders through war.\u201d In his nightly address on Sunday, he said hundreds of personnel from State Emergency Services, police, and local authorities were involved in the response efforts. He also reiterated his calls for more air defense systems and stronger preventative measures against Russian forces. Officials have said there were nearly 200 people inside the building when the strike occurred. According to Chief of the Investigative Department of the Kharkiv Regional Police Serhii Bolvinov, investigators and forensic experts spent the night searching the ruins of the store for human remains. \u201cWe fear that they will have to sift through the ashes to find the remains and identify the victims,\u201d he continued. Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister, Ihor\u00a0Klymenko, said Sunday that the hours following the strike were \u201chellish\u201d and thanked everyone who helped to put\u00a0out the flames that engulfed the hardware store after the attack. Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, noted that there is \u201cnot a single military object nearby\u201d the site of the strike. He said the remains of 10 people who died in the strike had been identified and eight people were still missing. Meanwhile, further south in the Kherson region, authorities warned residents to avoid open spaces as there have been reports of explosions. \u201cThe enemy is attacking from the temporarily occupied left bank,\u201d Roman Mrochko, the head of the Kherson City Military Administration, said in a Telegram post Sunday. \u201cDo not stay in open areas. Take care of yourself and your loved ones,\u201d he wrote. Russian forces attacked Ukrainian frontline positions in Kharkiv 15 times over the weekend, General Serhii \u201cMarcel\u201d Melnyk, Commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces, said earlier on Sunday, adding that \u201csome of the attacks are still ongoing.\u201d Overnight Saturday into Sunday, Russian forces launched 14 missiles and over 30 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military. Seven people were killed in Russian strikes on the city Thursday, after locations including a printing house were targeted. \u201cRussia continues its savage attacks on Kharkiv this week, striking a busy shopping center, a book publishing house and other civilian targets,\u201d US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said Saturday. \u201cWe condemn these attacks and commit to holding Russia accountable for its unprovoked war,\u201d she added. After Saturday\u2019s attack, Zelensky reiterated that \u201cif Ukraine had enough air defense systems and modern combat aircraft, such Russian strikes would have been impossible.\u201d \u201cThat is why we are appealing to all leaders, to all states: we need a significant strengthening of air defense,\u201d he said. Zelensky\u00a0has since appealed to US President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and Chinese leader\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0to attend a peace summit in Switzerland next month. \u201cPlease, show your leadership in advancing the peace\u00a0\u2013 the real peace and not just a pause between the strikes,\u201d Zelensky\u00a0said. \u201cThe efforts of the global majority are the best guarantee that all commitments will be fulfilled,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, at least two people were killed and at least 10 injured as a result of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian village in the Belgorod region, the region\u2019s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Saturday. Among the injured is an 8-year-old boy, he said, adding that \u201call victims had shrapnel wounds in various parts of the body.\u201d As a result of the strike, a private residential building caught fire, and about 20 other buildings and 23 cars sustained damage. \u201cAll operational services are working on site,\u201d Gladkov said.

{"id": "2024_05_31_americas_mexico-elections-us-relationship-analysis-intl-latam", "text": "With more than 98 million eligible voters, some 70,000 candidates and over 20,000 public offices being contested, Mexico\u2019s general election on June 2 will be the largest in the country\u2019s history. But it\u2019s not just the massive scale of the event that makes it so important in the eyes of observers across the border in the United States. For the first time in history, the country looks set to elect its first female president. The two front-runners are both women \u2013 Claudia Sheinbaum, of the Morena party, who is backed by the governing coalition Sigamos Haciendo Historia, and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, who is backed by an coalition of opposition parties. The vote is also important because it falls in the same year as the US presidential election \u2013 something that happens only once every 12 years \u2013 and comes at a time of transition in the relationship between the two countries. \u201cThe years when all the US wanted was a safe and stable Mexico are over. Now it is also interested in a country with good public policy,\u201d said Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro Medina, director of the Center for US-Mexico Studies at the University of California, San Diego, pointing to the increasing number of Latinos in the US and the two countries\u2019 growing ties. Here are a look at some of the biggest issues affecting the US-Mexico relationship that will be influenced by Sunday\u2019s vote: It\u2019s the economy, stupid Mexico became the United States\u2019 top trading partner last year, surpassing China and Canada. Experts say this is largely because geopolitical issues such as the pandemic, the legacy of  Trump\u2019s trade war against China, and the war in Ukraine all encouraged near-shoring \u2013 the relocation of supply chains nearer to home \u2013 which boosted US imports from Mexico and its investment in the country. Key to facilitating this shift was the creation of the USMCA trade agreement, which came into effect in 2020 between Mexico, the United States and Canada. \u201cThe USMCA offered, in that favorable context, a legal regulatory framework that provided a lot of certainty to the three North American countries, and Mexico has seized the opportunities and strengthened its preferential tariffs to make this happen,\u201d explained Lila Abed, director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. However, it\u2019s not all been plain sailing. Mexico\u2019s compliance with the USMCA has been an issue of contention between the administration of Mexico\u2019s current President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and those of both US President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump. \u201cThe next president of Mexico will have to deal with a series of legal disputes that the United States, supported by Canada, has filed within the framework of the USMCA,\u201d Abed points out. \u201cThese range from [L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s] ban on the import of transgenic corn for human consumption; the shift towards a nationalist energy policy, which has affected US investments in electricity and hydrocarbons, as well as the little importance given to clean energies,\u201d Abed said. According to Abed, whoever wins the Mexican presidency on June 2 will have to deal with a lawsuit filed by the United States on these issues. They will also have to renegotiate the agreement when it comes up for renewal in 2026. Many analysts believe the US is currently playing down disputes over the USMCA in the hope that this can ease differences in other areas, both in domestic Mexican issues \u2013 such as alleged human rights violations, the government\u2019s treatment of journalists, and the increase in political assassinations \u2013 and bilateral concerns such as immigration and the drug trade. \u201cIt\u2019s very transactional. Mexico agreed to partially manage the immigration crisis in the US, keeping immigrants in Mexican territory and taking care of their deportation, in exchange for the United States not activating these lawsuits,\u201d said Raquel L\u00f3pez Portillo Maltos, executive secretary of the youth group of the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations (Comexi) think tank. Jorge Alberto Schiavon Uriegas, vice president of the Center for Studies and Analysis on Mexico\u2019s Foreign Policy, said L\u00f3pez Obrador followed a quid pro quo policy towards both Trump and Biden, and this would possibly continue with Sheinbaum, if elected. \u201cMexico committed to addressing the two main Mexican issues affecting the United States and that will determine the next election: migration and fentanyl. In exchange, the United States dramatically reduced its criticism of Mexico\u2019s democratic and institutional weakness, and reduced its interventions, leaving more room for L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s domestic policy,\u201d said Schiavon Uriegas. Migration: Mexico, \u2018part of Trump\u2019s wall\u2019 While migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern, the issue is much lower on Mexican politicians\u2019 agenda than in the US \u2014 where it could be a decisive factor in the November vote, according to Carin Zissis, editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council of the Americas website. \u201cThe speeches of Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez on migration are neither very strong nor very different from each other, nor do they address too much what to do with migrants in the country,\u201d she said. \u201cProof of this is that, during the last presidential debate, when migration was addressed, the main angle was Mexican migrants currently living in the US; they were talking to their potential voters north of the border and to the Latino community in general, which is large and powerful due to remittances.\u201d The rub for US politicians is that they need buy-in from their Mexican counterparts if their own immigration policies are to succeed. Zissis gave the example of how Lopez Obrador had made Mexico \u201cpart of Trump\u2019s wall\u201d by sending \u201cthousands of members of the National Guard and the Army to take care of migration control.\u201d \u00a8Trump didn\u2019t have to build the wall because Mexico is the wall,\u201d said Zissis. Abed, of the Mexico Institute, said Mexico\u2019s next president would face a different conundrum to previous leaders, because the country had changed from being merely a transit country, which immigrants passed through on their way to the US, to being in many cases their final stop. \u201cThe reaction of the L\u00f3pez Obrador government has been to transport migrants who are waiting at the border between Mexico and the United States to the southeast of the country and leave them there. The migration authorities are overwhelmed, the Mexican Refugee Aid Commission (Comar) is also overwhelmed, the centers where migrants stay are very precarious, migrants \u2014 specifically unaccompanied minors and women, as well as young people \u2014 are at risk from organized crime and human traffickers, and their human rights could be violated,\u201d Abed detailed. She said the next Mexican government will need to assume responsibility for this large migrant population, \u201cand decide whether to give them a temporary visa, whether to allow them to work, whether they will have access to medical services, etc.\u201d Fentanyl and the drug trade Security is another pillar of the bilateral relationship, particularly in terms of the thriving cross-border drug trade that blights both countries. While the United States has been grappling with a domestic health crisis due to the amount of fentanyl on its streets, Mexico faces increasing cartel-linked violence \u2013 including in the run-up to the election which has been marred by dozens of assassination attempts and other political violence. \u201cM\u00e9xico has made progress in dismantling clandestine drug laboratories, but the next government must do more to stop the entry through maritime ports of precursor chemicals mostly coming from China, because after that is when they fall into the hands of organized crime to produce these synthetic opioids,\u201d Abed said. \u201cBut the United States also has to dismantle the network of traffickers within (its own borders). That is, once fentanyl arrives, its distribution throughout the territory is not magical. There is a significant network of organized crime in the United States that the administration must arrest, bring to trial, and whose activities it must restrict,\u201d she added. One issue the US may be keen to revisit with whoever wins on June 2 are the reforms to Mexico\u2019s National Security Law that the L\u00f3pez Obrador government implemented in 2018 as one of its first measures, which limited the activity of foreign agents operating on Mexican territory. \u201cIt was a symbol, a sign that the Mexican government was not going to open the door so easily to security agencies such as the DEA, the CIA, and others. He removed the diplomatic immunity (and) they had to register all their activities with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc,\u201d explained Abed. Experts who spoke to CNN said, however, that much of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s confrontational discourse with the United States was a facade that, at times, hid a well-oiled process of negotiations with both the Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cL\u00f3pez Obrador often speaks to his Mexican base and then negotiates. He knows that the US needs him on migration and security matters,\u201d said Zissis at the Americas Society website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/americas/mexico-elections-us-relationship-analysis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Mallory Swanson, playing in her home state of Colorado, and Tierna Davidson scored two goals apiece to secure the friendly win, which Hayes described as a \u201cgood start\u201d to her tenure. \u201cI think you can see we\u2019re building something,\u201d the former Chelsea manager told reporters afterwards. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of work to do. There\u2019s lots of holes in our play, no question, but it was a good start.\u201d \u201cI thought we were controlled with what we did in the first half, we stuck to the structures, we stuck to the coaching,\u201d she told broadcaster TNT Sports. \u201cThere were times maybe we could have played in behind in the right moments but going from underplaying to overplaying is usually the first step \u2026 Everybody did what I asked of them.\u201d After the USWNT had enjoyed several early chances, Swanson opened the scoring in the 34th minute, perfectly timing her run into the box and latching onto Sophia Smith\u2019s pass to thread the ball into the net. Two minutes later, Lindsey Horan\u2019s effort was pushed wide by a diving Kim Jung-Mi, much to the disappointment of the sold-out crowd at DSG Park in Commerce City, Colorado.They didn\u2019t have to wait much longer to celebrate again, however, as Catarina Mac\u00e1rio took the resulting corner, and Davidson\u2019s header looped over the South Korean defense and into the net. The USWNT\u2019s third goal came from a similar position just after halftime as Swanson\u2019s corner once again found Davidson who headed the ball in, before Swanson added her second goal of the match to round out the scoresheet. It marked a promising start to Hayes\u2019 time overseeing the USWNT, as she seeks to restore an aura of invincibility to the four-time Women\u2019s World Cup winners after it failed to reach at least the semifinals of the tournament last year for the first ever time.

{"id": "2024_06_02_style_tschabalala-self-artist-painting-black-bodies", "text": "Both a source of inspiration and a place to ground herself, Harlem holds a special meaning for the artist Tschabalala Self. \u201cIt definitely sculpted my personal worldview,\u00a0style and perspective,\u201d said Self of the Manhattan neighborhood, her hometown, famed for fostering generations of Black creatives, artists and intellectuals. \u201cIt\u2019s this world within the world of New York, the largest and most vibrant city in the world. I\u2019ve always been very proud to be from Harlem.\u201d This pride is most recently manifested in her latest exhibition, \u201cAround the Way,\u201d currently on show at the Espoo Museum of Modern Art, Finland. The show\u2019s title is a nod to Black American slang, referring \u201cto someone who\u2019s from our neighborhood,\u201d she told CNN. From referencing the brownstone brick-patterned architecture to real-life friends, family and local residents, the works on display serve as Self\u2019s homage \u2014 and tribute \u2014 to her Harlem. Self has become known in particular, perhaps, for featuring fuller figured Black women in her artworks, and incorporating sewn fabric and printmaking techniques. The Black female body is \u201cmy visual language, my visual aesthetic,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s my muse.\u201d Her work has been shown at institutions including MoMA PS1 in New York City, LA\u2019s Hammer Museum, and London\u2019s Parasol unit \u2014 and on numerous occasions in Harlem-based galleries. As a multidisciplinary creative, she works across fields including sculpture, performance, fashion and more, and is also as editor-in-chief at arts and visual culture magazine Elephant. Yet she\u2019s most at home describing herself as a painter, and credits her training in printmaking as heavily influencing her practice. \u201cI personally think of painting as being more of a philosophy than a literal application of paint,\u201d she said of her work, which is rooted in how different colors relate to each other. This relationship can then be replicated through other mixed media, including fabrics. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to think about new and innovative ways to approach painting\u2026 I describe it more as assemblage because the fabric is so dimensional,\u201d she explained of the appliqu\u00e9 techniques in which she works with fabrics on stretched canvas. \u201cSimilar to how other painters have a palette, I have hundreds of bits and scraps of fabrics\u2026 It\u2019s basically an accumulation of all my different fragmented memories or impressions from individuals that I knew well, or that I just happened upon,\u201d she continued. \u201c\u201cThrough the formal aspects of my work, I\u2019m able to address my central conceptual concern that one\u2019s identity is really the sum of many parts. Some of these parts are inherent, but others are projected and collected.\u201d This sense of collecting and gathering is epitomized in a piece in the new show, titled \u201cAnthurium.\u201d The work blends sewn, painted and printed elements to create a scene of domesticity \u2014 a key focal point of Self\u2019s work previously explored in her \u201cHome Body\u201d series, which depicted scenes of intimacy and interiority. Self\u2019s own relationship with the concept of home has evolved in recent years. Now based in upstate New York, the process of leaving her childhood home prompted her to investigate the significance of domestic spaces, both real and imagined. \u201cI think that the home is an actual site, but it also occupies an emotional and psychological space in people\u2019s minds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of something other than what it really is in reality, and those are the kind of environments I like to explore in my artwork.\u201d When considering Self\u2019s body of work on display in \u201cAround the Way,\u201d and more broadly, it\u2019s also clear that the physical body embodies a further exploration of \u201chome\u201d as a place of belonging, of community and of self-care. Her figures are as at home in their physicality as they are  in the world. She describes her approach to rendering and depicting Black women in particular as \u201can instinct,\u201d but she says that she was able to articulate this further through researching the significance of the Rubenesque figure. \u201cIt was interesting to me that the women had this physical aesthetic that was speaking to their abundance and plentitude. They did not have any need,\u201d she said. In her own practice then, this sense of abundance shows up in the way Self\u2019s characters boldly claim space within the picture frame, with their power rooted in their identity, femininity and physicality. This conversation with the traditional western canon of painting is ongoing for Self, and influences other facets of her work. In March 2024, Self was awarded the prestigious public art commission for London\u2019s Fourth Plinth \u2014 her sculpture, \u201cLady in Blue,\u201d will sit atop one of the plinths in Trafalgar Square, a landmark and tourist destination in the city also renowned for its commitment to highlighting contemporary art, starting in 2026. The piece will be a bronze statue of a Black woman striding in movement forward, wearing a bright blue dress. That color was inspired by lapis lazuli and ultramarine, a rare pigment used with significance in the western art canon. \u201cA lot of classical paintings have used lapis lazuli to denote a sense of honor and prestige to a revered figure. I wanted to use this color\u2026 to bestow that same significance.\u201d \u201cEspecially being an American artist, I think it\u2019s a great honor and I feel a lot of trust from the people of London,\u201d Self said.

{"id": "2024_05_31_americas_vatican-sodalitium-christianae-vitae-peru-investigation-in", "text": "Like many victims of sexual abuse, it took years for Santiago to acknowledge that he was raped as a teenager. \u201cYou get into a kind of mental confusion there is something that is not right, but it is not clear at that time,\u201d Santiago,\u00a0who is being identified only by\u00a0a pseudonym\u00a0to protect his privacy, told CNN in an exclusive interview. Four decades on, he is still waiting for a measure of justice to address his claims against Sodalitium Christianae Vitae (SCV), a\u00a0secretive\u00a0Roman Catholic society founded in Peru that has been mired in scandal since its layman founder Luis Fernando Figari and other senior members were accused of sexually abusing numerous adult and minor recruits. Santiago\u00a0says\u00a0that he was sexually abused by Figari at least three times in the 1970s, when he turned 17. He recalled Figari leading him to a room and raping him, saying it was \u201cthe only way to correctly see his aura.\u201d He doesn\u2019t\u00a0clearly\u00a0remember other incidents. \u201cIt is difficult to count because your brain starts to block things, I have tried, but there are some memories that are blocked,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to Figari\u2019s legal team\u00a0as well as SCV for comment.\u00a0Figari has denied all the allegations against him. Santiago is among the dozens of reported\u00a0victims\u00a0who have been waiting eagerly for the Vatican to reveal its findings about the SCV allegations, after a months-long investigation. SCV has already admitted that sexual, physical and\u00a0psychological\u00a0abuse took place. In 2017, it removed Figari\u00a0from the group and published a\u00a0two-part report\u00a0by international experts that found that more than a dozen men and three women alleged being sexually\u00a0abused\u00a0by SCV members\u00a0when they were young adults. In the report\u2019s preface, SCV asked for \u201cforgiveness from each person that has been hurt by a member or a former member of the\u00a0Sodalitium,\u201d and\u00a0said the organization was \u201ccommitted to a process of self-examination and of change.\u201d Now the case has moved into the hands of church authorities in Vatican City, whom victims hope will be able to take serious measures including disbanding the entire organization. As part of the ongoing investigation, the Vatican sent letters to several SCV members in February giving them 45 days to respond to allegations of abuse, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Vatican top abuse investigators, Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu,\u00a0made a\u00a0surprise\u00a0visit to Lima in July 2023, interviewing\u00a0victims including\u00a0Santiago and SCV representatives, among others. SCV told CNN via email the organization received specific guidance from the Vatican\u2019s mission in March to open investigations against former members, but the information is confidential. For now, it is unclear when the investigation results will be delivered, or in what form. But in August last year, Pope Francis confirmed to\u00a0reporters,\u00a0\u201cWe\u00a0are working on this. We are trying to bring the situation to light.\u201d Decades of \u2018impunity\u2019 SCV was founded in 1971 in Peru and has chapters across Latin America. In Peru, the lay organization,\u00a0under Figari\u2019s charge, recruited mostly young White\u00a0boys from elite Catholic schools and upper and middle-class families with political or business links, journalist and SCV\u00a0victim\u00a0Pedro Salinas told CNN. Many of them came from\u00a0families with divorced or single parents, according to former members. An explosive 2015 book by journalists Salinas and Paola Ugaz revealed 30 anonymous testimonies from SCV victims\u00a0including Santiago\u2019s, shocking conservative Peruvian society but only resulting in\u00a0failed leadership reforms and an ongoing court case against the group that has largely gone nowhere. In the book, titled \u201cHalf Monks, Half Soldiers,\u201d former SCV\u00a0members detailed that once the recruits reached the legal age, 18, they were encouraged to leave home and cut ties with family\u00a0and friends. Teenagers who were recruited were\u00a0brainwashed \u201cto become a kind of zombie, a robot, a fanatic, where there is a syncretism that mixes the Catholic religion with fascist ideas \u2013 Spanish fascism,\u201d according to Salinas, who says he himself was physically and psychologically abused at the Sodalitium when he was a teenager. Figari was seen as a charismatic figure, but he was also\u00a0described by former and current members as\u00a0\u201cvulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist,\u00a0and obsessed with\u00a0sexual issues and the sexual orientation of SCV members,\u201d the 2017 SCV report found. It added that Figari committed \u201cmultiple acts of sodomy of a minor male and a young adult male,\u201d\u00a0filmed young recruits \u201cin their underwear or bathing suits,\u201d and\u00a0directed them to perform sex acts on each other and himself, all under the justification of it being part of their spiritual formation. Figari denied\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0allegations publicly for the first time in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m innocent, totally innocent. I come here to tell the truth because the authorities have not allowed me to speak,\u201d\u00a0Figari told reporters in Rome. CNN has requested an interview with Figari\u2019s lawyer but has not received any response. It is believed he still resides in Italy. Military training and alleged sexual abuse When Santiago first joined the group as a curious student, he was keen to learn not only about religion but also about mysticism and the power of the mind, he told CNN. At the age of 15, Figari told him he had great mental powers and offered to train him in ancient techniques, Santiago said.\u00a0Part of this training involved Santiago only\u00a0wearing underwear and sitting on Figari\u2019s leg, he said. On another occasion, Figari made Santiago and another minor sit in the lotus position and asked them to touch each other, including their genitals, Santiago said. Years later, Santiago first reported his abuse to SCV members and filed a complaint against Figari at Lima\u2019s Archdiocesan Tribunal in 2011.\u00a0He did not get an official response or follow up,\u00a0he said. According to the 2017 SCV report, Figari also\u00a0imposed military training, gleaned from movies he watched, on the young recruits: Young boys were ordered to swim \u201cin cold ocean waters for several hours at a time\u201d\u00a0late at night or very early in the morning,\u00a0run long distances in severe weather and sleep on floors or stairs. Another\u00a0victim,\u00a0Oscar Osterling, now 51, told CNN that when he was 18 he and three other recruits were made to form a line naked and were filmed. He eventually joined SCV\u2019s team as community leader\u00a010\u00a0years later but said he\u00a0regrets potentially playing a part in the psychological abuse of other young recruits. \u201cAfter making my complaint I thought: \u201cHow many people I have also affected?,\u201d he said, adding that he has since \u201ccalled many people to ask for forgiveness.\u201d SCV declined to be interviewed for this article, saying they are fully cooperating with the Vatican\u2019s inquiry and highlighted\u00a0a private audience between its General Superior Jose David Correa and Pope Francis on\u00a0December\u00a01, when they shared \u201cupdated information about the organization.\u201d The search for justice According to Salinas and other victims, the steps toward accountability taken by SCV so far are not enough. They want to see the perpetrators formally punished and the organization dissolved. The Peruvian legal system so far has not led to any\u00a0resolution. A criminal case in Peru against Figari and other SCV members was dropped by Peru\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office in 2017, with prosecutors\u00a0saying\u00a0none of the alleged sexual abuse\u00a0victims\u00a0had come forward and\u00a0that\u00a0the alleged crimes fell outside the statute of limitations.\u00a0A\u00a0separate case on allegations of kidnapping, serious psychological injuries, and illicit association to commit a crime, is still working its way through the justice system. \u201cAfter so many years, this legal case is about justice for the victims and not about money, and that also means no impunity for those who have committed those crimes,\u201d\u00a0Dr. Jose Ugaz, former ad-hoc state attorney who represents seven of the victims,\u00a0told CNN. His clients demand\u00a0\u201cthis organization to stop\u00a0and (that)\u00a0harm does not continue to be caused to new children, teenagers or young people in Peru and in other several countries where it has expanded,\u201d he said. \u201cSodalitium is still active.\u201d Salinas, who has written to Pope Francis about the case, is pinning his hopes for justice on the Vatican\u2019s investigation. The Vatican has the power to dissolve SCV \u2013 a measure that Peruvian Cardinal Pedro Barreto has already called for. Pope Francis could also order sweeping reforms of the group, including the expulsion of members and special measures that must be followed. And the Pope recently changed the church\u2019s Code of Canon Law in 2021 to make lay people who hold an office in the church accountable for abuse, which would appear to\u00a0apply to Figari,\u00a0who is not a cleric. Church penalties for him could include fines, removal from all offices and expulsion from SCV. For the victims,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0about being heard and recognized after so many years. \u201cI felt privileged, I felt listened to \u2026 (with) that phone call,\u201d\u00a0 Santiago told CNN about\u00a0when he first learned the Pope\u2019s envoys wanted to meet him.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_middleeast_aid-gaza-down-two-thirds-israel-intl", "text": "The amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza has dropped by 67% since Israel launched a military offensive in the southern city of Rafah earlier this month, the United Nations has warned. \u201cThe amount of food and other aid entering Gaza, already insufficient to meet the soaring needs, has further shrunk since May 7,\u201d the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Wednesday. A daily average of 58 aid trucks reached Gaza between May 7 and Tuesday, down from an average of 176 aid trucks between April 1 and May 6, OCHA said, a drop of 67%. About 500 trucks per day crossed into Gaza before hostilities between Israel and Hamas began in October, according to figures from the UN, which has long urged that deliveries return to this level. The drop in aid deliveries came after Israel began its assault on Rafah in its attempt to destroy Hamas, which was believed to have regrouped in the south of Gaza after Israel\u2019s destruction of much of the north. Since Israel seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing on May 7, aid has been blocked, with supplies piling up in Egypt and the Strip teetering close to famine. A top Israeli security official this week warned that the war in Gaza could spill into next year, apparently dashing the possibility that the Rafah campaign could bring the offensive to an end. In its ruling last week, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said the humanitarian situation in Gaza could now be described as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and ordered Israel to keep the Rafah crossing open for \u201cunhindered provision at scale\u201d of aid. Israel and Egypt have blamed each other for the blockage. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on Egypt to reopen the crossing; his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry accused Katz of \u201cdistorting the facts,\u201d saying that Israel\u2019s offensive near the crossing \u2013 and the danger it poses to relief workers \u2013 was the reason Egypt is unable to bring aid into Gaza. Rafah had previously been the central artery for aid to flow into Gaza \u2013 and, in November, for some injured Palestinians and foreign nationals to enter Egypt. With Rafah now the epicenter of hostilities, aid has continued to trickle in from two other crossings: Kerem Shalom in the south and Erez in the north. Kerem Shalom was reopened last week after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and US President Joe Biden agreed to send aid to the UN via the crossing on a temporary basis. \u201cThis will help save lives,\u201d Biden said, while efforts continue to reopen the Rafah crossing. More than 370 aid trucks arrived at the crossing from Egypt on Monday, Israeli officials said. But UNRWA, the main United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, said it had picked up only 30 trucks for distribution on the Gazan side of the crossing. \u201cWhile the Kerem Shalom crossing remains open in principle, it is extremely difficult for aid organizations to access from the Gaza side due to the hostilities,\u201d OCHA said Tuesday. Some Israelis have in recent months staged protests at the crossing, demanding that no aid enter Gaza until Hamas release all of the hostages. In the north, some aid has been able to enter via the Erez crossing. From May 1 to May 20, the World Food Program transferred 500 trucks, carrying 7,000 metric tons of aid, through the crossing. But only the western side of the crossing is open, with Erez East still closed. Meanwhile, the temporary US-built pier to transport aid into Gaza, which cost $320 million and only began operating on May 17, broke apart Tuesday. It will be removed from the Gaza coast and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs, which will take more than a week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/middleeast/aid-gaza-down-two-thirds-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_d-day-80th-anniversary-commemoration-preview-intl", "text": "At 99 years old, Jack Foy is considered the youngster among his group of friends that fought in World War II. But their advanced age isn\u2019t going to stop them from making the transatlantic journey to honor their fallen comrades on the 80th anniversary of D-Day. On June 6, Foy \u2013 a survivor of the Battle of the Bulge \u2013 and his fellow American veterans will join dignitaries and heads of state from around the world to commemorate the approximately 160,000 Allied troops who, eight decades ago, carried out the largest seaborne invasion in human history. Foy told CNN that he has been to several memorials in France since 2014. The emotional resonance of each trip grows stronger year after year, he said, because these veterans know each trip could be their last. \u201cWe realize we\u2019re getting to the end of our time,\u201d Foy said. They are not alone. With major commemorations held every five years, organizers and government officials concede that this year\u2019s event could be the last to involve living veterans, whose stories of the horrors of war have become particularly poignant given that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has brought a large-scale ground war back to Europe for the first time since 1945. \u201cWe are perfectly aware that for these centenarians, this is maybe the last chance to return to the beaches where they landed, where they fought and where their brothers-in-arms fell,\u201d said Gen. Michel Delion, the CEO of the French government agency in charge of the French commemoration efforts, Mission Liberation. The various countries putting together the event are now planning what is expected to be the most extensive D-Day commemoration in history \u2013 both in terms of size and, crucially for elderly veterans, logistics. Approximately 150 American veterans are expected to travel to Normandy \u2013 about two dozen of whom actually fought on D-Day \u2013 said Charles Djou, the secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), the independent agency responsible for managing US military cemeteries and monuments overseas. The youngest is 96. Fifteen Canadian veterans, including three or four that fought on D-Day, are traveling with the Canadian delegation, according to John Desrosiers, the director of international operations for Veterans Affairs Canada. Desrosiers said the youngest traveling with the group is 98 and the eldest are 104. The British defense ministry said it expects more than 40 WWII veterans at the various events in Normandy. Those vets will be joined by about 25 heads of state and government, including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not extended an invitation due to the war in Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is planning on attending, according to a French presidential source. With so many heads of state in town, the security measures in place are intense. A massive contingent of 12,000 security personnel will be deployed on June 6, the French Interior Ministry said. Heavy travel restrictions put in place by French authorities will also effectively cut off the Norman coastline and the normally sleepy towns that dot it from the rest of the country. Yet June 6 typically sees these elderly men criss-cross the region to hit a full day\u2019s itinerary, including national ceremonies held at the American, British and Canadian cemeteries; the big international commemoration put on by France; and then, if they have the energy, more local events. Most veterans also travel with an entire phalanx of medical personnel. The charity that organized Foy\u2019s trip, the US-based Best Defense Foundation, is bringing three doctors and 10 nurses to accompany the 50 veterans they are flying over from the United States. Each veteran will travel with a personal caregiver \u2013 typically a family member or a friend. Officials say they are going to incredible lengths to treat veterans like royalty \u2013 as they are feted by actual royals. King Charles III will be there on June 6 \u2013 his first overseas trip since being diagnosed with cancer \u2013 alongside Queen Camilla and Prince William, Buckingham Palace said. Representatives from the royal families of Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands and Norway are also expected to attend. Delion\u2019s team has been holding rehearsals and timing wheelchair runs for the French-led international ceremony. They are also considering having veterans enter at the same time as heads of states and other dignitaries to reduce their waiting time. American and Canadian organizers told CNN that they will seat veterans last at their respective national ceremonies to keep them comfortable. The general public at the American event, for example, may need to be seated about an hour in advance due to security precautions. \u201cWe take care of the veterans who served and made the enormous sacrifices that they did in the Second World War,\u201d said Djou. Keeping the stories alive After being postponed 24 hours due to bad weather, D-Day began shortly after midnight on June 6, 1944, when paratroopers dropped into German-occupied France to lay the groundwork for the incoming invasion. Allied planes and warships began their bombardment at about 6:30 a.m., with troops hitting the beaches shortly after. They landed on a stretch of coastline 50 miles long organized into five beaches codenamed Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword and Utah. The Americans were responsible for Omaha and Utah. The British led the assault on Gold and Sword, while the Canadians handled Juno. Though 4,414 Allied troops died that day and it would take more than a month to achieve one of D-Day\u2019s main objectives \u2013 liberating the strategically important city of Caen \u2013 the landings were considered a success. Allied troops had successfully made it onshore in France; it was the beginning of the end for Hitler and Nazi Germany. The sheer drama of the event has, for decades, captured the American public imagination, because of both the magnitude of the invasion and the fact that it was a \u201cdigestible\u201d turning point in the war, according to Ben Brands, a military historian at the ABMC. \u201cWorld War II, especially in Europe, becomes this ongoing battle from basically the moment troops land on the beaches of D-Day until Germany ultimately surrenders. The human mind needs to cut that up into digestible stories, and D-Day is a really powerful, discrete event that is so critical for everything that comes after,\u201d Brands said. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many powerful stories that come out of D-Day.\u201d As time has passed, veterans have played a crucial role in passing down the stories of D-Day. Their gripping, visceral first-hand accounts are better teachers of history than any textbook. But just a fraction of the soldiers who lived through D-Day are still alive. Of the 16.4 million Americans who served in the military during WWII, fewer than 100,000 are expected to still be alive by the end of the year, according to statistics from the US Department of Veterans Affairs. In Canada, there were just 9,297 living Canadian veterans who had served in either WWII or the Korean War as of March 31, 2023, according to the most recent statistics available from Veterans Affairs Canada. The British defense ministry said it does not keep veteran numbers on hand. It\u2019s unclear what the average age of a WWII veteran is. Given that the median age for an American WWII veteran in June 2020 was 93, according to US Census figures at the time, most surviving vets from Allied forces are likely to now be at least in their late-nineties. By the 85th anniversary in 2029, those who are still living will almost certainly be in triple digits. \u201cPeople are realizing this generation is passing and they\u2019re passing rapidly now, and it\u2019s important to keep their stories alive, to keep the memories of those who died and are buried at Normandy, but also those who fought and survived because they can no longer be with us for that much longer to tell these stories,\u201d Brands said. \u201cThe 80th will be a very powerful event.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/europe/d-day-80th-anniversary-commemoration-preview-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_europe_pope-francis-accused-homophobic-slur-intl-latam", "text": "Pope Francis allegedly told Italian bishops to not permit gay men to train for the priesthood, with two Italian newspapers claiming that the 87-year-old pontiff made a homophobic slur in a closed-door meeting last week. Citing sources from inside the meeting, the Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica newspapers reported Monday that the Pope had made the comments while meeting with Italian bishops on May 20. The remarks took place in the context of proposals from the Italian bishops to amend guidelines on candidates to seminaries. The newspaper articles, which were translated from Italian, claimed the Pope had used an offensive noun which translates into English approximately as \u201cf*****ry, to describe some of the seminaries. The Vatican ruled in 2005 that the church cannot allow the ordination of men who are actively gay or have \u201cdeep-seated\u201d homosexual tendencies. In 2016, Francis upheld this ruling. Two years later he told the Italian bishops not to accept gay candidates for the priesthood. During his pontificate, the Pope has sought to offer a more welcoming approach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, saying \u201cwho am I to judge?\u201d when asked about gay priests, and has also offered the possibility that priests could offer informal blessings for same-sex couples. The Corriere della Sera newspaper stated that the Argentine pope, who speaks Italian as a second language, may not have been aware of how offensive his language was, adding that the remark was greeted with incredulous laughter by the bishops. A source close to the Pope told CNN that it could also be understood as there is a \u201cgay climate\u201d in the seminaries. There is no official transcript of the comments due to the nature of the closed-door meeting. CNN has reached out to the Vatican to request comment on whether the Pope used the term. They have not yet responded.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/europe/pope-francis-accused-homophobic-slur-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_style_princess-diana-exhibition-london-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Some of the most unforgettable photos of Princess Diana, such as her \u201crevenge dress\u201d that broke royal protocol and her handshake with an AIDS patient that changed the way the world treated those with the illness, have gone on display in a new exhibition in London. The exhibition, which is being held at Dockside Vaults just north of London\u2019s Tower Bridge and runs from May 25 to September 2, traces Diana\u2019s life as a humanitarian, a mother and a fashion icon. It displays a carefully curated selection of work by renowned royal photographer Anwar Hussein, 85, who started snapping Diana when she was 19. \u201cAt first, some told me \u2018you can\u2019t do pictures of royals,\u2019\u201d Anwar told CNN ahead of the exhibition\u2019s launch. \u201cI said, \u2018why not? I want a change.\u2019 I was doing rock and roll pictures - Bob Marley, Elton John, The Beatles. And then I got fed up with show business.\u201d Weaving through the vault\u2019s underground network of tunnels, CNN was given a tour of the exhibition by Anwar\u2019s two sons, Samir, 45, and Zak, 43. The pair have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps to become royal photographers in their own right, snapping viral photos of younger generations of the royal family. \u201cDiana did really buck the trend, especially for royals. She changed so much, and things that are now seen as normal, such as what Kate or Meghan wear, it was really Diana that changed all of that,\u201d said Samir, standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling print of the famed \u201crevenge dress\u201d photo, taken at a Vanity Fair party on the same day that Charles publicly admitted to adultery. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think she was going to come out, and then she just came out looking like a million dollars and made a really big statement that, \u2018I\u2019m not going to hide away, I\u2019m still going to be my own person,\u2019\u201d Zak added. For Anwar, it\u2019s a very different photo that stands out to him. \u201cThis was Diana\u2019s favorite,\u201d he said, looking up at a photo of Diana cradling a young cancer patient during a trip to a hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1996. \u201cThe boy was blind. He smelled of all these chemicals they had been using, but she didn\u2019t care and she cuddled him,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cLater on, he died and she was very sad about that. It shows her humanitarian side.\u201d Over the years, Anwar and his sons have taken hundreds of thousands of photos of the royal family. There is one word, however, which seems to encapsulate the images on display: legacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want (the exhibition) to be controversial. We wanted it to be a celebration of Diana\u2019s life and her legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had \u2018The Crown,\u2019 we\u2019ve had films about Diana, so it feels like there is a whole new generation experiencing it.\u201d And for Samir and Zak, their father\u2019s influence has also had a profound impact on their lives, something which is illustrated by two almost identical, yet eerily different, photos on display in another part of the exhibition. In the first photo, taken in 1992, Diana sits alone in front of the Taj Mahal in India, her red and purple suit, designed by Catherine Walker, is a pop of color against the softer backdrop of the ivory-white marble mausoleum. Anwar was told on the day of the Taj Mahal visit that Charles had other engagements, so Diana went without him, Zak says, recalling his father\u2019s recollections. \u201cShe ended up posing up in front of it, in front of this monument to love,\u201d he said. \u201cFairly soon afterwards, they announced their separation.\u201d Some 24 years later, Zak returned to the same spot to photograph Prince William and his wife, Catherine. \u201cThere was a lot of speculation. Would they recreate the picture of Diana there?\u201d Zak said. \u201cThey arrived and sat on the bench, but this time it\u2019s two people that are very much in love.\u201d In many ways, the exhibition is a love letter to two families: the Husseins behind the lens, multiple generations of royals in front of it. \u201c(Our father has) never done anything like this before,\u201d Samir said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting on now, he\u2019s a bit older and I think he really wanted to do a celebration of what he had done and a celebration of her as a person.\u201d In a statement, Anwar said: \u201cI am delighted that the images captured, as well as those of my sons, are coming home to London to recognize and memorialize such a remarkable woman and her sons.\u201d Tickets for the exhibition, which start at \u00a317 (about $22), include a 60-minute audio tour detailing the first-hand accounts behind each photograph.

{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_chinese-ships-japan-senkaku-islands-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China Coast Guard ships have been in waters around Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea for a record 158 consecutive days, according to Tokyo\u2019s latest count released Monday, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. Analysts fear the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China, have the potential to become a flashpoint for conflict between the two Asian neighbors. \u201cThe Japanese government takes very seriously the fact that there have been a succession of vessels sailing in the contiguous zone and trespassing in territorial waters,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a Monday briefing in Tokyo. The Japanese government\u2019s chief spokesperson did not say how often Chinese ships entered Japan\u2019s territorial waters, though foreign ships are allowed \u201cinnocent passage\u201d through such waters. A contiguous zone extends another 12 nautical miles beyond a country\u2019s territorial waters, the area that stretches 12 nautical miles from the shore. Foreign warships are allowed into contiguous zone waters \u2013 so the Chinese Coast Guard hasn\u2019t broken any international agreements \u2013 but the continuous presence of the Chinese vessels there is seen as a provocation. Hayashi said Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has raised Tokyo\u2019s \u201cserious concerns\u201d with Chinese Premier Li Qiang during a trilateral summit with South Korea in Seoul on Monday. \u201cWe will continue to take every possible precaution and surveillance around the Senkaku Islands with a sense of urgency,\u201d he said. Competing claims The uninhabited island chain has been a sore spot in Japan-China relations for years. Claims over the rocky chain, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo but only about 205 miles (330 kilometers) from China\u2019s east coast, date back centuries, and neither Japan nor China is likely to back down over territory considered a national birthright in both capitals. Tensions heated up in 2012, after Tokyo bought some of the islands from a private Japanese owner, which Beijing took as a direct challenge to its sovereignty claims. It has frequently dispatched China Coast Guard and other government vessels to the waters around the islands to assert those claims. \u201cDiaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are China\u2019s inherent territory,\u201d Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry said. \u201cIt is legal and reasonable for our Coast Guard to conduct normal patrols in waters administered by China.\u201d Experts have said China makes a statement and sets up a possible legal argument for sovereignty over the islands by keeping government ships near them. To present an international legal claim to the islands over Japan, \u201cChina simply needs to establish a greater and more enduring presence of its ships in the waters around the islands,\u201d James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo, told CNN in 2022. Hayashi, the Japanese government spokesperson, said Monday that Tokyo is answering the Chinese presence around the islands with vessels of its own. \u201cWe ensure a comprehensive security system for territorial waters by deploying Coast Guard patrol vessels that are consistently superior to other party\u2019s capacity,\u201d Hayashi said. Any Japanese-Chinese incident in the Senkakus raises the risk of a wider conflict, analysts note, due to Japan\u2019s mutual defense treaty with the United States. Washington has made clear on numerous occasions that it considers the Senkakus to be covered by the pact. China exerts pressure at sea The extended Chinese presence around the Senkakus comes as Chinese forces assert themselves in two other East Asian hotspots \u2013 around Taiwan and near Philippines-controlled features in the South China Sea. China staged its largest military exercises this year around Taiwan last week after the island\u2019s new democratically elected leader, President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity, was sworn in. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. And in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard has been taking action against Philippine vessels trying to resupply a contingent of Philippine marines on Second Thomas Shoal, using water cannons that have injured Filipino sailors and damaged their craft. The developments come as leaders and military officials prepare to gather in Singapore for the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia\u2019s premier defense summit. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to give the keynote speech Friday evening, with Chinese-Philippine clashes around Second Thomas Shoal expected to be a prime topic. The US and Chinese defense chiefs are also expected to address the conference. CNN\u2019s Himari Semans contributed to this report.

{"id": "travel_chef-mauro-colagreco-xi-jinping-state-dinner-france-intl-hnk", "text": "During the 11 years Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been in power, he\u2019s unintentionally kicked off numerous food and travel trends, from boosting the sale of bao in Beijing to accelerating the sale of an English pub. But when it comes to the official state dinners he attends, rarely does the public have a chance to experience those same dishes themselves. Until now. Back in early May, Xi headed out on a whirlwind trip through Europe, his first since 2019. While in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a formal state banquet at the Elysee Palace in the Chinese leader\u2019s honor, marking the 60th anniversary of China-France diplomatic ties. But curious diners hoping for a chance to sample what the two world leaders were served won\u2019t find the dishes in Paris. For that, they\u2019ll have to head to Hong Kong restaurant Plaisance, which has launched a special China-France State Dinner Experience menu that\u2019s available till late June. The restaurant is an outpost of Mauro Colagreco, chef-owner of famed eatery Mirazur in Menton, France, and one of just three chefs called in to create the state dinner menu. The chance to cook for a mystery guest Colegreco says the opportunity to cook for the famous world leaders started with a phone call from the Elysee Palace. \u201c[They were] asking me to take part in the menu for this state banquet, without knowing who the guest president would be, for reasons of state secrecy,\u201d Colegreco tells CNN in an email, adding that he quickly said yes to the assignment. \u201cThis adds to the excitement, as you never know what the guests\u2019 tastes will be. But in the end, we created a menu that is very true to the cuisine I love, with exceptional products and delicate flavors.\u201d Colegreco was tasked with designing the starter of the night. With his Italian-Argentine background and experience in France, the chef is known for fusing influences from all of those cultures, with a strong focus on seasonality and sustainability. In 2019, he became the first non-French chef to earn three Michelin stars in France with Mirazur. It was crowned the No.1 restaurant at the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants awards that same year. Colagreco says their team only had a month to design and prepare their dish for the state dinner \u2013 but the chefs were given \u201ccarte blanche\u201d\u00a0to create whatever they liked as long as it \u201cwas representative and respectful of French products.\u201d \u201cI must admit, I was quite confident when I found out who the guest was; I have a deep love for Asia and my very first experience there was in Shanghai in 2011,\u201d says Colagreco. In addition to the Plaisance restaurant in Hong Kong, his restaurant group now has five establishments in mainland China. Colagreco says it was a challenging and thrilling experience to create a menu for the two world leaders. After developing the recipes, the chefs sent their various requirements and lists of ingredients to the Elysee Palace kitchen team, led by chef Fabrice Desvignes. Then, on the morning of the state dinner, the Mirazur team arrived to start preparing for the evening alongside the other chefs. Within this short period, Colagreco says they had to be flexible and make their way around the unfamiliar kitchen quickly and smoothly. \u201cThen we had a visit from Mrs. Brigitte Macron in the kitchens, which really reassured and motivated us,\u201d he says of meeting France\u2019s First Lady. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a responsibility to cook for her. It\u2019s only now that we realize how lucky we were to be part of this wonderful moment.\u201d The starter that wowed China\u2019s First Lady A total of 250 guests were invited to the state dinner. The final menu was relatively short \u2013 a three-course meal to suit the leaders\u2019 tight schedules. Colagreco\u2019s starter was a Tourteau crab (homegrown crab from France) and Oscietra caviar cake blanketed by a beautiful pink and purple flower-infused jelly casting. \u201cThe whole team took the time to come up with a surprising dish,\u201d says Colagreco. \u201cWe had to offer flavors that would appeal to everyone\u2019s taste buds, but also present our culinary identity. The aim was to showcase our expertise in healthy eating and respect for the product. \u201cBut it was also an artistic and colorful presentation, with the veil of our cosmos flowers that we brought from our unique Mirazur gardens. Aesthetics are very important because it\u2019s the first approach to a dish and this one is particularly refined.\u201d And thankfully for the chef, that attention to detail didn\u2019t go unnoticed. \u201cThe Chinese president\u2019s wife seemed to find it very attractive, so mission accomplished,\u201d he says. Colagreco was able to talk to the guests at the end of the dinner. That was when he says Peng Liyuan, Xi\u2019s wife, thanked him and complimented the aesthetics, finesse and flavors of the starter. Pierre Gagnaire, chef of the eponymous three-Michelin-star restaurant in Paris, was in charge of the evening\u2019s main course. He opted to serve slow-cooked Bresse chicken and morels in a blend of Cognac, Port and Madeira wine and chicken stock. The dish was topped with a sauce made with Vin Jaune, a special white wine made in France\u2019s wine-making Jura region. The dessert, strawberries and verbena pavlova, created by D\u00e9licatisserie founder and superstar pastry chef Nina M\u00e9tayer, wrapped up the evening. Fromagerie\u00a0Quatrehomme, a cheesemonger and refiner in Paris since 1953, curated the cheeses for the event. All the serveware used during the dinner was provided by La Manufacture de S\u00e8vres, which was founded in 1759 and is one of France\u2019s principal royal/national porcelain factories. \u2018Food is what binds the world together\u2019 At Colagreco\u2019s Plaisance restaurant in Hong Kong, diners will get to sample all three of the dishes Xi and Macron were served during the recent state dinner. The chef says the dishes and ingredients remain true to the original versions \u2013 only the presentations will be adjusted as the tableware will be different. For those who have a bit more time than Xi and Macron, the restaurant also offers a longer menu with three additional dishes from the Mirazur and Plaisance restaurants. The cost of the three-course option starts from 1,888 Hong Kong dollars ($241), while the six-course menu is 2,888 Hong Kong dollars ($369). Having moved to France in 2001, then opening Mirazur in 2006, Colagreco says the state dinner was a special moment for him. \u201cI am truly proud and honored to have been chosen for this exceptional dinner and to represent France, my host country for almost 23 years, through my cuisine,\u201d says the chef, who is now 47 years old. \u201cI truly believe that food is what binds the world together. Cooking is an act of love. As chefs, it\u2019s our duty to pass on these values of sharing and to contribute to a positive atmosphere for this kind of diplomatic dinner.\u00a0We are ambassadors, using our cuisine to showcase French know-how and to introduce people to our culture through flavors and combinations of tastes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/chef-mauro-colagreco-xi-jinping-state-dinner-france-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

The country\u2019s plans include landing astronauts on the moon by 2030 and building a research base at its south pole \u2013 a region believed to contain water ice. Sunday\u2019s landing comes as a growing number of countries,\u00a0including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field. Samples collected by the Chang\u2019e-6 lander could provide key clues into the origin and evolution of the moon, Earth and the solar system, experts say\u00a0\u2013 while the mission itself provides important data and technical practice to advance China\u2019s lunar ambitions. Chang\u2019e-6 touched down within an impact crater known as the Apollo Basin, located within the\u00a0sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer-diameter South Pole-Aitken Basin, according to Chinese state media Xinhua. It had orbited the moon for about 20 days as part of a larger probe, which is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a re-entry module. It is now expected to use a drill and a mechanical arm\u00a0to gather up to 2 kilograms of moon dust and rocks from the basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago. The probe will spend two days on the far side of the moon, and 14 hours to collect moon soil samples, Xinhua reported. To complete its mission, the lander will need to robotically stow those samples in an ascent vehicle that made the landing with it. The ascent vehicle will then return to lunar orbit, where it will\u00a0dock with and transfer the samples to\u00a0a re-entry capsule, according to mission information provided by the China National Space Administration. The re-entry capsule and orbiter will then travel back to Earth\u2019s orbit and separate, allowing the re-entry capsule to make its expected return later this month to the Siziwang Banner Landing Site in China\u2019s rural Inner Mongolia region. The technically complex mission is made more challenging due to where it is being conducted. The far side of the moon is out of range of normal communications, which means Chang\u2019e-6 must also rely on a satellite that was launched into lunar orbit in March, the Queqiao-2. China plans to launch\u00a0two more missions\u00a0in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon. Multiple nations are expanding their lunar programs, with a growing focus on securing access to resources and further deep-space exploration. Last year,\u00a0India landed\u00a0a spacecraft on the moon for the first time, while Russia\u2019s first lunar landing mission in decades ended in failure when its\u00a0Luna 25 probe crashed\u00a0into the moon\u2019s surface. In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its\u00a0Moon Sniper lander\u00a0faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a\u00a0NASA-funded mission\u00a0designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the south pole. That landing \u2013 the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades \u2013 is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there\u00a0as soon as 2026\u00a0and build its scientific base camp.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/china/china-change6-moon-landing-intl-hnk-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_europe_netenyahu-ceasefire-hamas-contradiction-biden-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that the conditions for ending the country\u2019s war in Gaza \u201chave not changed,\u201d raising questions over a peace proposal\u00a0laid out by US President Joe Biden which he said Israel submitted. During a speech Friday, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war. Part of the agreement, he said, would see a truce and hostage exchange while Israel and Hamas negotiate a permanent end to the fighting. It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza\u00a0have\u00a0been met, and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting. The proposal has been welcomed across the international community. The UN, the UK, France, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have all expressed support for Biden\u2019s proposal, while Qatar and Egypt joined the US in calling on Israel and Hamas to \u201cfinalize\u201d the proposed ceasefire agreement. For its part, Hamas said it viewed the plan \u201cpositively\u201d and is ready \u201cto deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.\u201d But a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office on Saturday said Israel\u2019s goals \u2014 \u201cthe destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel\u201d \u2014 would need to be met before a permanent ceasefire can begin. \u201cUnder the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place. The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter,\u201d the statement said. Saturday\u2019s statement largely reiterated earlier comments from the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) made less than an hour after Biden detailed the peace proposal on Friday, with Netanyahu insisting the country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated and all hostages had been returned. For all the messaging, however, it is unclear exactly to what degree Israel supports the plan. The earlier PMO statement insisted the \u201cexact outline\u201d of the proposal allows Israel to \u201cmaintain\u201d its goals in the conflict. The Israeli online newspaper The Times of Israel said that Netanyahu\u2019s statement on Saturday was geared towards outlining what kind of ceasefire agreement Israel is prepared to agree to, rather than ruling one out. Domestic pressure mounts for Netanyahu Netanyahu is facing domestic pressure, both from opposition leaders to get a ceasefire agreement on the table, and from ministers within his own party not to back down on Israel\u2019s original war goals. Families of Israelis being held hostage are meanwhile urging him to accept the proposal. Protesters took to the streets of several cities across Israel on Saturday, demanding Netanyahu\u2019s resignation and for early elections to be held. They also demanded the release of all hostages held in Gaza and for the Israeli government to accept the latest proposal laid out by Biden. Families of hostages held in Gaza took part in protests in Tel Aviv, Caesaria, Haifa, Herzeliya, Kfar Saba. At Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, protesters called the names of the 125 hostages still in Hamas captivity. \u201cStart streaming this deal, so that it will start moving\u2026 Start working, start acting,\u201d a woman in Tel Aviv shouted over a loudspeaker. In Caesarea, protesters called for Netanyahu to accept the hostage release deal that Biden presented. \u201cThere is no victory until every last hostage is returned,\u201d people chanted. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid wrote on X Saturday that Israel\u2019s government \u201ccannot ignore President Biden\u2019s significant speech.\u201d Lapid said he was offering\u00a0Netanyahu a \u201csafety net,\u201d saying he would support\u00a0him\u00a0in securing a hostage deal if far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich left the government. Gvir, Israel\u2019s National Security Minister, had previously threatened to leave\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s coalition if a ceasefire is reached before Israel achieves its declared war aims. Also in his speech on Saturday, Biden alluded to the tensions in the Israeli government, making a direct appeal to ordinary\u00a0Israelis\u00a0to voice their support for a hostage agreement that would result in a ceasefire. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,\u201d he said. The international pressure Netanyahu\u2019s government is facing to end the war in Gaza has also been mounting, as the conflict approaches its ninth month. The war was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage. The Israeli campaign in Gaza since then has killed more than 36,000 people. Fighting continues. This week, the Israeli military confirmed that it was operating in the centre of Rafah, southern Gaza, while a top Israeli security official warned the conflict could last into next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/europe/netenyahu-ceasefire-hamas-contradiction-biden-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

The four-time Olympic gold medalist came into the second day of the senior women\u2019s all-around competition in first place with an astonishing score of 60.450, more than three points ahead of second-placed\u00a0Skye Blakely and third-placed Kayla DiCello. And to underscore her dominance, Biles led the field on every apparatus after the first day. She started on the vault, executing a Yurchenko double pike and then a Cheng to finish with a 15.800. Even though the uneven bars are considered Biles\u2019 \u201cweakest\u201d event, she scored a 14.650 to extend her lead through two rotations. On her third rotation - the balance beam - Biles continued her stellar performance, finishing with a 14.800. She finished the night on the floor, scored a 15.200 to solidify her lead, and goes into the final day with a great chance to win yet another all-around national title, and further consolidate her status as the most decorated American gymnast ever. Suni Lee, the 2020 Olympic all-around champion, sits in fourth place overall while Jade Carey, the 2020 Olympic floor champion, is in eighth place. The national championships are the final event for US gymnasts before the Olympic Trials in late June. The women\u2019s team to compete at Paris 2024 will be chosen after the Olympic Trials, with the winner of the all-around competition at the Trials automatically making the team. Biles is aiming to edge closer to returning to the Olympics, the competition where she experienced the \u201ctwisties\u201d \u2013 a mental block causing gymnasts to lose track of their body positions \u2013 at the Tokyo Games. She took a two-year break from the sport afterwards to focus on her mental health but returned last year, sealing her comeback with a history-making performance at the world championships. After winning a silver and four gold medals there, she became the most decorated male or female gymnast ever, surpassing Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo\u2019s record of 33 overall medals across both the Olympics and the world championships. Meanwhile, in the men\u2019s competition, Brody Malone took his third national all-around title n Saturday, completing his remarkable comeback from a serious injury last year that required several surgeries to repair torn ligaments and cartilage in his knee, as well as a fractured leg. \u201cIt just feels amazing to be able to - with everything I\u2019ve gone through - be able to come back and make a comeback like I have and be competitive enough to be on the top again,\u201d Malone said afterwards, per the Olympics. He also took the gold medal on the high bar, the apparatus on which he sustained his horrific knee injury and on which he became world champion in 2022. Malone finished ahead of Frederick Richard, who also won on floor, and Khoi Young. How to watch Biles compete The second day of the women\u2019s competition will take place on Sunday, from 6.45 p.m. ET to 9 p.m. ET. All podium training sessions will be available to watch on\u00a0FlipNow.tv\u00a0\u2013 USA Gymnastics\u2019 streaming service \u2013 while Peacock,\u00a0NBC\u00a0and CNBC will broadcast the main sessions.

{"id": "2024_06_02_americas_mexico-election-voting-sunday-intl-latam", "text": "Mexicans headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in a historic election, overshadowed by violence, that is expected to return the country\u2019s first woman president. The two leading presidential candidates are women: Claudia Sheinbaum from the leftist Morena party and Xochitl G\u00e1lvez, from the conservative PAN party, who is representing a coalition of opposition parties. The third candidate is Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez, the youngest in the race, who is representing the center-left Citizens\u2019 Movement. Sunday\u2019s poll is the largest election in the country\u2019s history. More than 98 million voters are registered to cast a ballot in\u00a0Mexico, and 1.4 million Mexicans are eligible to vote abroad. More than 20,000 positions are set to be filled with an estimated 70,000 candidates vying to become senators, mayors and governors. Violence has loomed large in this election, the bloodiest in Mexico\u2019s history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants have been killed by criminal organizations trying to influence those coming into power. While voting was largely peaceful on Sunday, it was suspended in the southeastern Mexican town of Coyomeapan due to violence at the polling centers in the morning, according to state electoral authorities. The poll is seen by some as a referendum on the policies of outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 Sheinbaum\u2019s mentor whose popular social welfare helped poorer Mexicans, but whose \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d policy of not confronting cartels has not led to a substantial drop in homicide numbers. He greeted supporters as he voted on Sunday. Meanwhile, as Sheinbaum made her way to cast her ballot, she called for Mexicans to vote, telling reporters: \u201cThis is a historic day, I am feeling very happy.\u201d G\u00e1lvez told reporters at a polling station that she was expecting it to be a long day and a very close call. Polls opened at 8 a.m. local time and will close at 6 p.m., according to\u00a0Mexico\u2019s National Electoral Institute (INE). However, on Sunday, some voting stations in parts of the country opened with delays. Long lines were seen in Mexico City, Yucat\u00e1n, Tuxtla, Cuauht\u00e9moc, and voting centers abroad. One exasperated woman in Mexico City, who had been waiting for 40 minutes for her polling station to open, said she would not be able to vote before the polls closed at 6 p.m. as she had to go to work. In Madrid, Spain, expatriate Mexicans told CNN they waited more than eight hours to cast their ballots. One Mexican voter said she had been in line for 11 hours. Authorities are telling them INE is to blame. Polls were meant to open at 8 a.m. local time in Madrid, but INE posted on social media on Sunday afternoon saying voters waiting in line at embassies in Madrid and Paris could now cast their ballots. They\u00a0added that the polls will close once 1,500 votes have been cast or everyone who registered votes. CNN has contacted\u00a0the Mexican Embassy in Madrid for comment. Of the more than 200,000 expatriate votes expected to come from abroad, more than 70% will be coming from voters living in the United States. Outside the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles, thousands of people queued up to vote on Sunday as some in the crowd chanted \u201cMorena\u201d \u2013 the name of the ruling party. Security concerns on the ballot Whoever is elected will face several challenges, including security, organized crime, energy, and immigration. They will also set the tone for the US-Mexico\u00a0bilateral relationship. Outside polling stations, voters told CNN that public security was one of their main concerns. A minute of silence was held on Sunday by the advisers of the INE in memory of the people who have been murdered during this electoral period. There have been more than 20 political killings since September according to the Mexican government. By some estimates, that number is even higher, at least 34 candidates murdered, according to Mexican consultancy firm, Integralia. While\u00a0the murder rate fell in Mexico\u00a0between 2019 and 2022, in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of homicides of around 30,000 each year, experts say. Both Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez have largely remained coy about their proposals regarding security. Neither\u00a0has\u00a0repudiated a nearly two-decades-long approach of relying on the armed forces to tackle organized crime \u2013 which\u00a0has coincided with\u00a0the high numbers of homicides. The central challenge for the next president will be\u00a0convincing voters that she can end the culture of impunity in Mexico, where\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved in\u00a02022, according to the think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua. US officials are closely monitoring the presidential election as it comes at a critical time for the Biden administration. A\u202frecord number\u202fof migrants at the US-Mexico border has been seized upon by Republicans who claim it as proof of the Biden administration\u2019s impotence, pushing immigration control to a top election issue. In recent months, the US has relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US\u2019 southern border. The election in Mexico has raised uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what, if anything, will change with a key partner when it comes to border cooperation. \u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about elections in Mexico or here in the US, it always provokes a level of uncertainty with everyone, generally, but especially in the migrant population,\u201d a Homeland Security official previously told CNN. CNN\u2019s Gustavo Vald\u00e9s, Karol Suarez, Priscilla Alvarez and Esha Mitra contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_31_weather_power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate", "text": "Picture this: It\u2019s a Thursday night in Houston and thunderstorms are rolling in. Suddenly, winds roar past 100 mph. Trees snap, windows shatter and the city darkens as power flickers out. Even after it\u2019s over, it takes days for the lights to come back on in parts of the city. A week and a half later, the Tuesday morning commute is just getting underway in Dallas. Thunderstorms rush through the city, unleashing hurricane-strength wind gusts and torrential rain. Trees and power lines topple to the ground, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people. Many homes and businesses remain without power days later. That\u2019s exactly the scenario that played out in Texas over the past few weeks, and these kinds of outages are happening more frequently as destructive extreme weather thrashes the aging electric grid. From 2000 to 2023, 80% of all major US power outages were due to weather, according to analysis by Climate Central, a non-profit research group. The number of weather-related outages from 2014 to 2023 doubled compared to outages at the start of the century. Being without power is not only expensive \u2013 keeping people out of work and school, and keeping businesses closed \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous. There doesn\u2019t need to be a heat wave in Texas for summertime temperatures to soar to unhealthy levels. Heat is particularly dangerous without A/C at night, which is when the body needs to cool itself after a hot day. Experts say there could be ways to keep the lights on in the face of extreme conditions, even if there\u2019s no single perfect solution. Why can\u2019t the lights stay on? Power generation, transmission and distribution within the US happens on a power grid, an interconnected series of power plants, power lines and electrical substations. But the grid\u2019s infrastructure is aging fast and struggling to keep up with modern power demands, according to the US Department of Energy. It\u2019s also struggling as extreme weather gets more intense as the planet warms. \u201cOur (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,\u201d Michael Webber, a professor of engineering at the University of Texas said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.\u201d A majority of the US electric grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, but some of the first parts of the system were constructed in the early 1900s. And 70% of transmission lines in the US are approaching the end of their 50- to 80-year lifecycles, according to the DOE. Every element within the power grid is vulnerable in some way to extreme weather, Webber told CNN. Power is largely distributed by above-ground power lines from large transmission towers to smaller \u2013 and abundant \u2013 power poles. Most outages happen because of failures with power lines and poles, making them a \u201cbig weakness\u201d in the overall system, according to Webber. Severe weather \u2013 defined as thunderstorms, high winds, heavy rain and tornadoes \u2013 was far and away the main cause of weather-related major outages at 58%, according to Climate Central. And it directly impacts these exposed lines. Power lines and poles can be brought down by falling tree limbs, topple over in fierce winds and be snapped by heavy ice. Extreme events, like the derecho and tornado that tore through the Houston in mid-May, can turn massive transmission towers into mangled metal. Hurricanes, like 2021\u2019s Ida, inflict damage at a colossal scale. When infrastructure can\u2019t withstand extreme weather, it not only disrupts power, it also creates its own disasters: The massive Smokehouse Creek Fire ignited earlier this year after a \u201cdecayed\u201d power pole toppled in strong winds, according to a report from the Texas House of Representatives. But it\u2019s not just power lines and power poles under attack from extreme weather; the things that generate power can also take a beating. Blasts of frigid cold can freeze necessary equipment, leaving it unable to keep up with demand. Historic cold shuttered power plants and froze non-winterized wind turbines in Texas in 2021. The resulting power outages were vast and deadly in the brutal cold. Meanwhile, searing heat sends electricity demands skyrocketing as cooling needs surge. If power needs cannot be met, blackouts and brownouts arise. Equipment also overheats and fails if temperatures soar too high. Modernized equipment can keep the A/C running \u2013 for a price In order to keep power flowing during extreme weather, or restore it quickly in the aftermath, the US grid needs to be upgraded and fortified on a vast scale. It will cost trillions of dollars to do this well, according to Webber. Power poles, power lines and transmission equipment need to be built or rebuilt stronger and operate at a higher capacity to keep larger amounts of power flowing, even when demand spikes. At the most basic level, a wooden power pole is less durable and has a shorter lifespan than a metal pole. Installing sturdy, metal poles means more stay upright in extreme weather, but they could come at an environmental cost, given how energy intensive it is to make steel. Fortified power lines above ground will still sometimes be knocked over by violent storms, so another solution is to put power lines underground. Parts of the US are already doing this, including cities like Anaheim, California, and Fort Collins, Colorado. But burying electricity isn\u2019t perfect solution, either. Running power lines underground is often 10 times more expensive than building overhead wires, and the lines are susceptible to flooding and can be difficult for crews to service, according to Rob Gramlich, founder and president of Grid Strategies, a power grid consulting firm. Modernization of outdated power lines costs around $100,000 per mile, while new power lines can run anywhere from $1 million to $10 million per mile depending on geography and whether they are above or underground, according to Webber. But it\u2019s an investment that will pay for itself when fewer power lines spark devastating wildfires or outages that cost up to billions of dollars are avoided, Webber contends. A stronger grid also has to have smarter controls to rapidly reroute power where it\u2019s needed when outages do occur. \u201cAny number of things can happen to power generation in any one area,\u201d Gramlich told CNN. \u201cBut if you have fortified inter-regional transmission, you have an insurance policy against many risks.\u201d The US is designed so that if power needs in one region spike because of increased demand or power generation fails, another region steps in to help handle the load. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind make the grid more resilient by diversifying the number of ways power is generated if another method fails. But, the energy generated by renewable means is still delivered via the same vulnerable infrastructure as all other power. It may be an insurmountable task to eliminate weather-related power outages completely, but it should be possible to eradicate major, multi-day outages. \u201cUltimately, I think it really should be extremely rare to have a multi-day power outage,\u201d Gramlich said. \u201cWe can plan the whole electricity system so that never happens.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/weather/power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "weather_us-leads-tornado-numbers-tornado-alley-xpn", "text": "The US averages over 1,150 tornadoes every year. That\u2019s more than any other country. In fact, it\u2019s more than Canada, Australia and all European countries combined.  Within the US, every state has had at least one tornado, and some have dozens each year.  The US is special in terms of producing so many tornadoes, especially violent ones. In the US, the average number of tornado fatalities per year is 73. But in Europe, where the tornadoes are usually much weaker, the fatalities are estimated to be between 10 and 15 annually. Some states are deadlier than others Texas on average has 140 tornadoes every year \u2013 the most of any state. Kansas, Florida, Oklahoma, and Nebraska round out the top five. But the total number of tornadoes does not always tell the whole story. For example, despite Alabama having on average 42 tornadoes per year \u2013 more than three times fewer than Texas \u2013 it is at the top of the list for tornado fatalities. Alabama averages 14 tornado fatalities per year, almost double the next highest \u2013 Missouri with eight deaths per year. The time of day and the topography where the tornado occurs makes a big difference in the fatality rate. The topography in Alabama and other Southern states often includes rolling hills, plateaus, and many more trees than the Plains states like Kansas, Texas, and Nebraska, where a tornado often can be seen from miles away. The more likely a tornado can be seen often leads to the tornado being reported faster, allowing more time for people to be warned and seek shelter. Southern states such as Tennessee, Kentucky and  Arkansas also see more tornadoes overnight versus any other state. This can lead to higher fatalities, since many people are sleeping and unaware that a tornado is approaching.  \u201cTornadoes in the Southeast tend to be more dangerous than their Great Plains counterparts,\u201d says Brandon Miller, CNN Meteorologist.  \u201cThere are a number of reasons for this, some weather and some geographic. Southeastern tornadoes often travel faster, moved by a faster jet stream.\u201d  All of these factors can lead to higher fatality rate in Southern states compared to the Plains. But all of these states have a few things in common: the ideal atmospheric conditions for tornadoes to form. \u201cThe basic ingredients for severe thunderstorms that can make tornadoes are warm, moist air near the ground, relatively dry, cool air aloft (about 10,000 to 30,000 feet), and horizontal winds in the environment the storm forms in that increase as you go from the ground up and change direction with height, blowing from the equator near the ground and from the west aloft,\u201d says Dr. Harold Brooks, senior scientist with the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. Low pressure systems in the US pull warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air aloft from the Rocky Mountains or the High Desert in the southwest. The states that fall in between those two regions end up being in the ideal location for severe weather to ignite.  \u201cNo place else in the world has the large warm water on its equatorward side with a wide high range of mountains extending from north to south to the west of it,\u201d Dr. Brooks said. \u201cAll the other tornado prone regions have at least one feature suboptimal.\u201d  The US leads every other country for tornadoes Other countries experience tornadoes, including Germany, Australia, South Africa, eastern China, Japan, Bangladesh, Argentina, and more. Europe as a whole is comparable to the size of the US, but there is a vast difference in number of tornadoes and tornado fatalities.  From 2011 to 2020, the US averaged a preliminary total of 1,173 tornadoes per year, and Europe around 256. However, Dr. Pieter Groenemeijer, Director of the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL), cautions that the European number may be on the low side. \u201cWeaker tornadoes are likely still under-reported in some countries, such as France and the UK,\u201d Groenemeijer says. European Russia (which is the part of the country west of 58 degrees East longitude), tops the list at 86 tornadoes annually. Germany comes in second with an average 28 tornadoes annually. The peak density of tornado reports coincides with the high population density over Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, according to a study on severe storms in Europe published in December 2020. The study also reports that thunderstorms are twice as frequent over the United States, with as many as four times more storm reports, compared to Europe. One thing most countries have in common is the time of day that tornadoes occur, which is most frequently during the afternoon and early evening. But the peak season is not the same. In the US, spring is the peak for tornado activity. For central and northern Europe the main tornado season is in summer, whereas it is autumn for the western and central Mediterranean region, and winter in the eastern Mediterranean. Outside of the US, Canada actually ranks second on the list for most tornadoes, with an average of 100 per year. Tornadoes are not limited to the Northern Hemisphere. Australia has dozens every year, and South Africa also reports annual occurrences. South America, much like other continents, has its own tornado hotspot, known as \u201cpasillo de los tornados.\u201d This tornado corridor includes Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and a portion of Brazil.  According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, tornadoes are relatively rare there. On average, around seven to 10 moderate to strong tornado events are reported in New Zealand every year. Southern Hemisphere tornadoes typically rotate clockwise, which is the opposite of how tornadoes primarily spin in the Northern Hemisphere.

{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_russia-defense-ministry-shakeup-intl", "text": "Removing a long-time defense minister from his post is nothing out of the ordinary. Arresting five of his senior staff, however, is clearly more than just a search for fresh blood \u2014 especially in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. After the shock ouster, two weeks ago, of Sergei Shoigu as the minister for defense, a wave of arrests has gutted the defense ministry\u2019s top brass under the guise of an anti-corruption campaign. The timing is as intriguing as the arrests and reshuffle. After almost three years of failure on the battlefields in Ukraine, Russia has just gained the upper hand. It has, in recent weeks, launched a largely successful offensive in the north, toward Kharkiv, coupled with victories in the Donbas region in the east, too. Ukraine\u2019s crippling manpower shortage and dwindling ammunition supplies \u2014 exacerbated by months of stalling in the US Congress to approve a military support package \u2014 have also helped reverse Russia\u2019s fortunes. So the question then is, why shake up the ministry in charge of winning the war now? Analysts who spoke to CNN described the defense ministry as one of the most corrupt in the country. Russian state media has been disclosing military contracts worth eye-watering sums of money and publicly shaming the ministry\u2019s senior officials and their lavish lifestyles. But as one analyst told CNN, what we are witnessing is a \u201cvery complex polycentric game,\u201d one that is related to timing and Putin\u2019s existential search for victory against the West. Prigozhin message from the grave Hanging over this shake-up is the ghost of Yevgeny Prigozhin, boss of the Wagner mercenary group, who was also formerly known as \u201cPutin\u2019s Chef.\u201d Before his death, he had expressed hatred for Shoigu and Russia\u2019s top general, Valery Gerasimov, through profanity-laden tirades, accusing them and the ministry of corruption and incompetence. Prigozhin led a mutiny on Moscow that was supposed to end with the overthrow of Shoigu and Gerasimov. Instead, he put the president in an awkward position and challenged his authority. Putin responded by describing Prigozhin as a traitor and stripped him of his assets, all before he died in a suspicious plane crash, alongside his most senior advisers. Since then, Putin has kept the inefficiencies of the ministry\u2019s weapons procurement, as well as its bungled invasion of Ukraine and corruption allegations, out of the public eye, keen to show he would not make any knee-jerk reactions following the mutiny. Doing so might question his authority and strength to the Russian people. Putin was likely awaiting his reelection by the Russian people in March before making moving in on the defense ministry. The changes came shortly after Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which Putin and Shoigu attended, side by side, in a seemingly amicable appearance. Despite his removal as defense minister, Shoigu will remain in Putin\u2019s orbit after being moved sideways to a new role as secretary of the security council. Putin\u2019s interests: Ukraine Tatiyana Stanovaya, Senior Fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN that whether Prigozhin may have been right about the officials\u2019 corruption is not what\u2019s important. In Russia, she said, \u201cright and wrong doesn\u2019t exist in politics \u2014 only interests matter.\u201d Putin\u2019s interest is in keeping his house in order but, more pressingly, achieving victory in Ukraine. The defense ministry is central to how that war ends. With Putin installing a civilian economist, Andrey Belousov, as the new defense minister, he has signaled he wants the ministry, with its vast budget, to procure weapons more quickly and economically. Russia\u2019s 2024 budget shows it is seeking to spend 6% of GDP on defense, the highest in modern Russian history, and will outpace social spending \u2014 a sign of the country\u2019s transition to a wartime economy. The corruption in question \u2013 Shamarin and Ivanov Mikhail Komin, a Russian political scientist and Visiting Fellow at the European Council of Foreign Affairs based in Vienna, told CNN that \u201cShoigu\u2019s group, among the Russian elites, is one of the most rent-seeking. More, for example, than some of Putin\u2019s inner circle.\u201d Last Friday, Lieutenant General Vadim Shamarin, chief of the Main Communication Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces, was charged with \u201creceiving a bribe on an especially large scale,\u201d of 36 million rubles (around $393,000) from a factory that supplies the ministry with communications equipment. In exchange, he is alleged to have awarded the company lucrative government contracts. Shamarin has pleaded not guilty, according to Russian state media. Russian state media has also played a role in communicating the Kremlin\u2019s crackdown on the ministry. Following Shamarin\u2019s arrest in May, state-run Ria Novosti reported that his wife had purchased a Mercedez-Benz GLE in 2018 for 20 million rubles (about $218,000) at a time when his income was no higher than $34,000. A separate report found her income that year was 872,000 rubles ($9,740). The highest profile of the five officials arrested was Timur Ivanov, the deputy defense minister. He was put under house arrest in late April, also on suspicion of taking bribes. Ivanov had become a focus of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, founded by Alexey Navalny, who was killed in a Russian prison in February. He and his organization exposed the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by Ivanov\u2019s partner \u2014 visiting invite-only jewelers, wearing couture clothing and owning a chalet in the chic ski resort of Courchevel in France. They questioned how she afforded such a lifestyle when her husband\u2019s salary was officially $175,000 a year. Russian state media reported that Ivanov maintains his innocence, citing its own source. There can\u2019t be overlap, but corruption will still remain For Stanovaya, the reasons for replacing figures such as Ivanov and Shamarin are simple. \u201cPart of Putin\u2019s logic is that you can\u2019t field someone in this position (as defense minister) where there are significant interests of the previous.\u201d To help clean up the ministry, Putin has appointed Oleg Savelyev, a former auditor at the Russia Accounts Chamber, as the deputy minister of defense. He will be \u201caware of the corruption that already exists in the defense sector,\u201d Komin said. Prigozhin\u2019s final wish Given the sweeping changes made by the president, rumors have swirled about the position of the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, the other target of Prigozhin\u2019s rants. Stanovaya said, \u201cThere are so many rumors now that he [Gerasimov] might be dismissed soon,\u201d but the fact he has so far been spared gives Gerasimov \u201ca window to start fighting for his own interests,\u201d she added. \u201cGerasimov is fighting against his enemies, trying to secure his future,\u201d Stanovaya said. Komin agreed that Gerasimov may keep his position for now, as Putin has said he does not intend to make any other changes. Crucially, Komin suggested that Gerasimov\u2019s luck may be that there lacks a position, similar to Shoigu\u2019s where he can publicly be moved aside without completely tarnishing his reputation, \u201cit\u2019s not a big deal to find the new guy. It\u2019s more a big deal to find the place for the previous guy.\u201d In Putin\u2019s Russia the president remains laser focused on winning in Ukraine, but recent overtures have shown that the supporting cast may change and the president is ready to be ruthless in his search of victory.

{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger", "text": "A ransomware attack on a major US hospital network that began three weeks ago is endangering patients\u2019 health as nurses are forced to manually enter prescription information and work without electronic health records, nurses at two hospitals affected by the cyberattack told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s putting patients\u2019 lives in danger,\u201d said a nurse who works at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, a 290-bed facility about 25 miles north of downtown Detroit. \u201cPeople have too many patients for what is safe. Nurses are taking on five or six patients dealing with all of this paper charting.\u201d Another nurse, who works who works at a 409-bed Ascension hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN: \u201cIt is frightening how many safety guardrails [have been] out of service without any computers.\u201d The nurses spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs. The cyberattack hit Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit that oversees 140 hospitals across 19 states, on May 8, but the healthcare network is still working to bring its systems back online. Ransomware attacks that cut off access to electronic health records are a grimly regular occurrence in American life. The health care sector\u00a0reported\u00a0249 ransomware attacks to the FBI last year, more than any other sector, with some cases affecting patient records. But the Ascension incident is raising concerns about the threat to patient health posed by cybercriminals in a way that numerous other ransomware attacks on US health providers haven\u2019t, according to interviews with nurses and cybersecurity experts. The two Ascension nurses said in separate interviews that they felt overwhelmed by the abrupt shift to paper records following the cyberattack, underwhelmed by their hospitals\u2019 plans for dealing with the situation and worried that they or their colleagues will make mistakes entering a patient\u2019s vital medical information. \u201cI don\u2019t have any orders in the computer,\u201d the Rochester, Michigan-based nurse said. \u201cI can\u2019t see what labs are ordered and their results.\u201d OPEIU Local 40, a union that represents nurses at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, distributed an online\u00a0petition\u00a0on Friday saying union members were \u201cdeeply concerned about the current challenges faced by our healthcare professionals\u201d because of the cyberattack, and urged the hospital to take a series of remediating steps, including limiting the nurse-to-patient ratio. Mac Walker, Ascension\u2019s director of media relations, did not answer CNN\u2019s questions about the petition or the nurses\u2019 comments on patient safety. Instead, Walker emailed this statement on Wednesday morning. \u201cRestoring EHR [electronic health records] access has been among the top priorities of our recovery process,\u201d Walker said. \u201cDue to the hard work of our teams over the past several days, we have successfully restored EHR access in our first market and are actively progressing against a plan to restore access across our network on a rolling basis.\u201d Walker did not respond when asked what Ascension\u2019s \u201cfirst market\u201d meant. Ascension, the fourth largest hospital network in the country\u00a0by some measures, said in a public statement Friday that it has been working\u00a0\u201caround the clock with industry-leading cybersecurity experts to safely restore operations across our network.\u201d In the wake of the Ascension hack and another ransomware attack in February that disrupted insurance billing at pharmacies across the US, Biden administration officials say they\u00a0are preparing\u00a0to release a set of minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals.\u00a0But the cybersecurity challenges in the health sector are legion and beyond the scope of any one policy prescription, experts say. Senior officials from the White House and Department of Health and Human Services plan to meet with cybersecurity executives from health care companies on Wednesday to discuss how to better protect hospitals from hackers, three sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. \u2018Exorbitant\u2019 wait times for lab results In statements to the press, Ascension has said that its staff are \u201cappropriately trained to maintain high quality care during downtime.\u201d But the nurses interviewed by CNN say that the shift to paper records and manual operations is taking a toll on hospital operations. With computers down, doctors have been writing paper prescriptions for patients that nurses take to a machine to manually enter without a cross-check from the local pharmacy, according to the two nurses. \u201cThey have to put an override in there to get the medication out,\u201d said Dina Carlisle, president of OPEIU Local 40. \u201cThere\u2019s no second safety check from the pharmacy.\u201d It has also taken an exorbitantly long time to get lab results because of the hack, the nurse in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN. A \u201cstat lab,\u201d or lab work needed to make quick decisions on patient care, that normally takes 30 minutes to an hour to process has taken hours, the nurse said. A growing problem for hospitals Ransomware attacks in the US\u00a0routinely force hospitals\u00a0to divert ambulances and cancel appointments. That causes a strain on neighboring hospitals that pick up the slack. But a lack of clear public understanding of how cyberattacks on hospitals directly impact patient care is undercutting the urgency needed to deal with the problem, according to health advocates and cybersecurity experts. Researchers are increasingly quantifying how lethal ransomware can be. Roughly 3 in 100 hospitalized Medicare patients will die in the hospital under normal conditions, but during a ransomware attack, that number increases to 4 out of 100 because of the strain on hospital resources,\u00a0according\u00a0to scholars at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, who studied 374 ransomware attacks on health providers. Part of the problem,\u00a0experts say, is that some hospitals have failed basic tests of cybersecurity \u201chygiene,\u201d or sound defensive measures, while many small clinics lack the resources to secure themselves. And, perhaps more than any other sector, health care firms hold an enormous volume of sensitive data that is ripe for targeting and extortion schemes. The number of sensitive data records held by the health care sector grew by more than 63% last year \u201cfar surpassing any other industry and more than five times the global average,\u201d according to a study by security firm Rubrik. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue and snarled service at pharmacies across the US. Andrew Witty, the CEO of\u00a0UnitedHealth Group, which owns Change Healthcare,\u00a0apologized\u00a0in a recent congressional hearing for the security lapse and said he authorized a $22 million ransom payment to hackers to try to protect patient data. Yet a third of Americans could have had their data stolen in the hack, he said. \u201cWe routinely decline healthcare entities unwilling to address things like unpatched critical vulnerabilities, misconfigurations or uneven application of MFA [multi-factor authentication] \u2014 the very things hackers leverage to breach systems. And then we regularly see them breached later,\u201d Sezaneh Seymour, head of regulatory risk and policy at cyber insurance firm Coalition, told CNN. (She said her firm had no specific insights into the Change Healthcare or Ascension ransomware attacks.) Health care providers also make attractive targets for cyber extortionists because hospitals can ill-afford to be offline for long because of the disruptions it causes to operations. \u201cWhen we look at ransomware targeting, it\u2019s: who is the most easily targetable, who can afford little downtime and who has the highest willingness to pay,\u201d Bryan Vorndran, the FBI\u2019s senior most cyber-focused official, said in an interview. \u201cAnd where there\u2019s low-downtime environments, you have obviously a willingness to pay more so than in environments where they can afford downtime,\u201d Vorndran told CNN. \u201cI think all of that is relevant not just to the healthcare sector but to some other sectors as well.\u201d He declined to comment when asked about the Ascension hack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Its consistent wind makes it a hotspot for kitesurfing enthusiasts, but a new port, currently halfway through construction, could turn the area into a gateway for trade. The $1.2 billion megaproject is expected to complete in 2028. Spanning 1,650 hectares, the complex will include a trade port with an oil terminal, a fishing port and a shipyard. There will be a bridge linking the port to the land and a 7-kilometer road that connects the port with a national highway that runs along the coast as far north as Tangier and as far south as the border with Mauritania. \u201cWe\u2019re constructing an ecosystem,\u201d Nisrine Iouzzi, the director of construction for the Dakhla Atlantic Port, tells CNN. Once operational, she expects the port to handle 35 million tons of goods a year. This will not only boost Morocco\u2019s economy, she says, but it could help the country become a maritime hub for worldwide trade, connecting regions such as West Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America, the Canary Islands and even South America. \u201cThe geographic location is key (to) the success of the port,\u201d she says, adding that the project has attracted significant foreign investment, including from the United Arab Emirates. Gateway to Africa The project is part of Morocco\u2019s national port strategy, which aims to modernize and strengthen port infrastructure by 2030, in order to enhance its role in global supply chains. Seaports such as Casablanca, Tanger-Med and Agadir have already been or are being upgraded, but because of its location, the Dakhla port is seen as particularly significant in opening up\u00a0other parts of the African continent for the world to trade with. \u201cWe strongly believe that with this infrastructure \u2013 port infrastructure, road infrastructure, renewable energy \u2013 we will be very attractive for investors that aim to get to one of the fastest growing markets, which is the West African market,\u201d says Mounir Houari, general manager of Dakhla\u2019s Regional Investment Center. With the implementation of Africa\u2019s continental free trade agreement, which aims to create a single market for goods and services, the port could encourage the processing of raw materials within the continent. \u201cLess than 5% of African natural resources are processed in Africa because there is no industrial infrastructure and exporting infrastructure,\u201d says Houari. The Dakhla port \u201cwill encourage many Africans to start processing natural resources in Africa, allowing African countries to create more jobs to improve their skills and know-how and strengthen their own industries.\u201d The Sahel region, especially landlocked countries such as Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso, are expected to benefit. Houari explains that Morocco has granted the region access to its road and port infrastructure, providing \u201ca door to the Atlantic maritime trade.\u201d Turloch Mooney, head of port intelligence and analytics at research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, says the development could be beneficial to the region. \u201cIt is very positive to see modern port and trade infrastructure being developed in the Western Sahara where there is potential to support a large hinterland in West Africa and the Sahel,\u201d he says. \u201cQuality port infrastructure and efficient port operations is part of the package of assurance for foreign direct investment and has been a key factor in the successful growth strategies of many developing countries.\u201d But Western Sahara and the Sahel region has a long history of unrest. \u201cLocal disputes can make developing port infrastructure and reliable logistics much more challenging,\u201d says Mooney. He cautions that infrastructure alone won\u2019t drive trade growth in the region, and that the port\u2019s success will depend on good governance, reliable transport connections and political stability.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/new-atlantic-port-of-dakhla-africa-trade-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

With results in from 22% of polling stations at 4 p.m. local time, support for the ANC stood at 43.5%. The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had 24.7% of the vote, while the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 a splinter party of the ANC \u2013 had 8.9%, data from the country\u2019s electoral commission showed. The respected research group CSIR modeled the ANC winning less than 45% of the national poll as of mid-morning on Thursday.

In past elections, results from rural areas \u2013 where the ANC has major strongholds \u2013 have come in later, boosting results for the party. Once all the votes are counted, if the ANC remains below 50% it will be forced to enter a coalition with one or more parties. Depending on how low its support dips, it may need to form a deal with one of the larger opposition parties such as the DA or EFF to remain in power.

That\u2019s a tiny fraction of the roughly one million Gazans\u00a0who have been displaced from the area. \u201cThe sounds, the smells, the everyday life are horrific and apocalyptic,\u201d Hollingworth told journalists Friday after returning from a trip to Gaza. \u201cPeople sleep to the sounds of bombing, they sleep to the sounds of drones, they sleep to the sounds of war, as now tanks roll into parts of central\u00a0Rafah, which is only kilometers away. And they wake to the same sounds,\u201d said Hollingsworth. \u201cFrom the seventh of May to the 20th, not a single WFP truck crossed from the southern corridors of Egypt into\u00a0Rafah,\u201d he said. Rafah had previously been the central artery for aid to flow into Gaza, as the only border crossing not controlled by Israel. But since Israel seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing on May 7, aid has been blocked, with supplies piling up in Egypt and the enclave teetering close to\u00a0famine. Israel\u2019s military has continued to push further into Rafah, defying international concern and anger over its operations in the city. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Friday that its troops were in central Rafah \u2013\u00a0confirming\u00a0what eyewitnesses told CNN earlier this week, when tanks were spotted there for the first time since it entered the city in May. \u201cIDF\u00a0troops in central Rafah located Hamas rocket launchers, terror tunnel shafts, and weapons. The troops also dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility in the area,\u201d the\u00a0IDF\u00a0said in the statement. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had established \u201coperational control\u201d over the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Palestinian side of the Egypt-Gaza border. The IDF\u2019s operations in Rafah have prompted a 67% drop in the amount of humanitarian aid getting through, according to the UN. Gaza is now receiving a daily average of 58 aid trucks \u2013 down from the daily average of 176 trucks between April and May, which itself is far from the 500 trucks that used to enter Gaza each day before the war broke out in October. With Rafah now the epicenter of hostilities, aid has continued to trickle in from two other crossings: Kerem Shalom in the south and Erez in the north. CNN has contacted WFP to clarify whether it managed to send trucks via alternative land crossings. The IDF said 36 trucks were transferred on Thursday through Kerem Shalom and Erez West on behalf of the WFP. Hollingworth added that the WFP\u2019s warehouse in\u00a0Rafah, which was once capable of storing 2,700 tons of food, is no longer operational. \u201cWe do not have the supplies available to provide significant numbers of ready-to-eat ration boxes. We don\u2019t have significant supplies of wheat flour to hand out to those families that have a stove to cook on,\u201d Hollingworth said \u2013 but added they are providing around 400,000 hot meals to families in central\u00a0Rafah.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/middleeast/wfp-rafah-gaza-food-aid-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_style_helicopter-photographer-donn-delson", "text": "\u201cThis is not daredevil stuff,\u201d says 75-year-old fine art photographer Donn Delson as we sit in a helicopter with no door, almost 2,000 feet above London. At this height, the winds are numbing even in May, yet Delson, on the outermost seat, dangles his legs out as a diminutive Big Ben and Tower Bridge pass by beneath us. \u201cOn a good day I\u2019ll go out on the (skid),\u201d he says rather nonchalantly, referring to the two nail-bitingly thin helicopter landing bars beneath us. \u201cBut harnessed up, of course, and only when we\u2019re hovering.\u201d While many may turn green at the thought of hanging out of a door-less helicopter, this is the desired set up for Delson \u2014 who refuses to put his camera lens anywhere near a window. \u201cIt\u2019s really the only way I want to shoot,\u201d he said, back on the ground the following day, of his penchant for working at height. \u201cI do everything on a large scale, because I want people to get the feeling I have when I\u2019m up there.\u201d The feeling, as it appeared sitting next to Delson in that same sky-high \u2018copter, is one of complete calmness. Mid-flight, he grumbles at the fierce winds and asks the pilot to slow the aircraft down to a hover. Suddenly we\u2019re suspended \u2014 wobbling in the air somewhere above the river Thames (a designated heli-lane intended to spare the rest of the city in the event of a crash) as Delson reaches under his headset to remove the black cap worn backwards on his head. \u201cMuch better,\u201d he says, and gives the signal to fly on. Delson, who is based in Los Angeles, began his career as an aerial photographer almost a decade ago. He\u2019s since spent over 300 hours in a helicopter, capturing everything from the ephemeral cherry blossoms of Japan to rugged mountain trails hidden in the Red Sea \u2014 sometimes from as high as 12,000 feet. His preference to charter private helicopters, which costs him between $800 and $2,500 per hour, is made possible by the fact that this is his 9th career. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to have been an entrepreneur most of my life, and be successful in my business activities,\u201d Delson told CNN. After selling his last company BandMerch \u2014 one of the largest entertainment merchandise businesses in the world with Rihanna, Outkast and Billy Joel as his clientele \u2014 Delson was able to retire, briefly, before a chance holiday excursion set him on a new path. \u201cWe were on a trip to New Zealand, and my wife and I had the opportunity to go up in a helicopter to see a glacier,\u201d he said. The pilot, noticing a hefty camera strapped around Delson, offered to open the door in order to let him shoot out unencumbered. \u201cMy wife said no. I said, \u2018Sounds fabulous.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s an uncanniness to looking down at the world from above. The usual markers of your street-level experience have vanished, as has everyone else in the world. It\u2019s quiet and still. If there wasn\u2019t the looming anxiety of a potential helicopter malfunction, it might even be peaceful. Delson\u2019s work leans into this strange, disembodied feeling by capturing scenes that trick the eye. A parking lot filled with cargo containers that look like musical bars on a xylophone; or the Red Sea\u2019s sprawling canyons and gullies that could be the branches of an ancient tree. \u201cThe French term trompe l\u2019oeil was used by painters whose paintings were so lifelike you\u2019d think it\u2019s a picture. I want to make audiences rethink assumptions about what they\u2019re seeing.\u201d There\u2019s no guarantee Delson will get one of these illusionary shots, however. In Japan, the photographer spent between 20 and 25 hours in the air over the course of a week \u2014 in Israel, he flew for a combined 36 hours. But sometimes he won\u2019t take a single picture. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d Delson said. \u201cI have no idea when I go up whether or not I\u2019m going to find anything.\u201d Even if he returns empty-handed, Delson believes there is more to be gained from the experience than simply making new work. \u201cI\u2019m definitely different than before I started flying,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself to be a fairly spiritual person, but the perspective that one gets when you have the opportunity to do these things is transformative.\u201d Journeying back to the office at ground level, London seems a lot smaller. Just a few hours before, the capital was an intimidating, sprawling metropolis home to almost 9 million people. Now it feels almost bijou. The London Eye, what I considered to be the vertiginous pinnacle of the city at 10 years old, now feels laughably miniature; nothing more than a hamster wheel.\u00a0 Even Canary Wharf struggles to seem as imposing once you\u2019ve seen 50-storey landmark One Canada Square from 1,200 feet, shrunken to the size of a Lego brick. \u201cThe world from above, it\u2019s just so different from the world we know,\u201d said Delson. For any newcomers or tourists, struggling with the numerous skyscrapers, boroughs, tube lines or zone demarcations \u2014 try stepping into a helicopter. The result is a city that feels much more manageable.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/style/helicopter-photographer-donn-delson/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_china_china-trump-conviction-trending-intl-hnk", "text": "As Donald Trump\u00a0became the first former US president\u00a0to be convicted of a felony on Thursday, the historic verdict sparked huge interest \u2013 and a fair amount of schadenfreude \u2013\u00a0in China. As a rising authoritarian superpower, China has long sought to project its political system as superior to American democracy. But while Trump\u2019s trial has been a boon for that narrative, it\u2019s also offered a potential window into something unimaginable and dangerous to the ruling Chinese Communist Party \u2014 an elected leader held accountable by independent courts and prosecutors, convicted by a jury of his peers. For months, Chinese propagandists have attempted to use Trump\u2019s indictments to strengthen Beijing\u2019s narrative of a United States in decline, citing the months-long legal battle as a prime example of the polarization and dysfunction of American politics. And as China woke up Friday to the news of Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, the country\u2019s heavily censored social media lit up. On Weibo, China\u2019s X-like platform, the verdict became the top trending topic, racking up more than 120 million views by the afternoon. \u201cTrump\u2019s supporters, hurry up and mobilize, storm the Capitol,\u201d said a top comment under a news brief by state news agency Xinhua. Another said: \u201cComrade Nation Builder Trump should not be fighting alone.\u201d On the Chinese internet, the former US president earned the nickname of Chuan Jianguo, or \u201cTrump, the (Chinese) nation builder\u201d during his time in office \u2013 a quip to suggest his isolationist foreign policy and divisive domestic agenda were actually helping Beijing to overtake Washington on the global stage. Some nationalist influencers gleefully mocked the verdict. \u201cIt seems that in 2024, a civil war in America is not just a dream!\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0one such blogger with 4 million followers. Under leader Xi Jinping, China\u2019s most assertive leader in decades, the country\u2019s social media platforms have become increasingly dominated by anti-American, nationalistic voices. \u201cAlthough he is guilty, he can still run for president. A \u2018criminal\u2019 can become president \u2013 this is the ridiculous aspect of Western-style democracy,\u201d said another. Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of state-run nationalist tabloid Global Times, also weighed in. \u201cNaturally, Chinese people are watching the spectacle with amusement,\u201d he said on Weibo. \u201cHere\u2019s what everyone is most concerned about: First, will Trump actually go to jail? Second, can he still run for president?\u201d But analysts say Trump\u2019s conviction could be a tricky topic for Chinese state propagandists to navigate. \u201cOn the one hand, it highlights a rotting and fracturing American democracy. On the other hand, it highlights that a former top leader can be arrested, put on trial, judged by jury of peers and convicted, for relatively small acts of corruption,\u201d wrote Bill Bishop, a China watcher and author of the Sinocism newsletter. China\u2019s judicial system remains tightly beholden to the ruling Communist Party, according to legal observers, and has a conviction rate of\u00a0around 99%. The timing of the conviction also added to the sensitivity, coming just days before the 35th anniversary of Beijing\u2019s bloody crackdown of the pro-democracy Tiananmen movement in 1989, according to Bishop. So far, Chinese state media outlets have yet to publish the kind of blistering commentaries that previously appeared alongside news coverage of Trump\u2019s legal entanglements. Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the\u00a0National\u00a0University of Singapore, said China\u2019s state media is unlikely to play up the coverage in the days ahead. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to attack Donald Trump because if he becomes the president, they know the consequences. Instead, they\u2019re likely to use it to showcase the problems of the US system,\u201d said Wu, a former reporter in China. \u201cThey need to be really careful about that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/china/china-trump-conviction-trending-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_29_middleeast_israel-gaza-war-seven-months-end-year-intl", "text": "The war in Gaza will likely continue through at least the end of the year, an Israeli official warned Wednesday, seeming to dismiss the idea that fighting would end after the military offensive against Hamas in Rafah. Israel\u2019s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said the year 2024 has been \u201cdefined as a year of combat\u201d by Israel\u2019s war cabinet. \u201cWe are now in the fifth month of 2024, which means we expect another seven months of fighting to deepen our achievements and achieve our goal of destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,\u201d Hanegbi said. The comments came as Israeli tanks \u2013 seen Tuesday in central Rafah for the first time since the operation began earlier this month \u2013 continued to probe the southern Gaza city on Wednesday, despite mounting global pressure to stop the offensive. The Israeli government had previously signaled that entering Rafah would be the final stage of its war against Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 people hostage. In response, Israel launched a devastating offensive in Gaza which has killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Despite the prospect earlier this month of striking a ceasefire-for-hostages deal with Hamas, the more extreme wing of Israel\u2019s war cabinet had urged that the Rafah offensive go ahead, arguing that destroying the group was more urgent and of greater importance than returning the hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza. But Hanegbi\u2019s comments suggest that the Rafah operation may not mark the end of hostilities, raising questions about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plans to wind down Israel\u2019s campaign and his plans for the post-war governance of Gaza. While Netanyahu has portrayed Rafah as Hamas\u2019 \u201clast bastion\u201d his forces have been operating in northern areas the military previously said it dismantled the militants\u2019 command structure. In a radio interview on the Israeli station Reshet Bet, Hanegbi said \u201cit was honestly stated in the first days of presenting the plans to the cabinet that the war would be long.\u201d \u201cYou need to have patience and know how to stand strong. This resilience is what has allowed this nation to survive for 75 years, and even for 3,000 years before that. Just don\u2019t use a stopwatch on ourselves or set ultimatums,\u201d he said. Israel is pressing ahead with its military offensive in the face of growing global outrage, after an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 45 people and injured 200 others in Rafah at a camp for displaced people, which Israel had designated as a safe zone. Video from the Tal al-Sultan camp showed scenes of horror: charred bodies being pulled from the rubble, a man holding the headless body of a child, fire raging from tents in the background. A CNN analysis of video from the scene suggests that munitions made in the United States were used in the strike. But US President Joe Biden is not altering his policy towards Israel, suggesting the strike on Rafah had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support, despite him telling CNN earlier this month he would not allow certain US weapons to be used in a major offensive in Rafah. The strike came days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its offensive in Rafah, or any actions \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The ICJ said the humanitarian situation in Rafah can now be described as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and could worsen still if Israel\u2019s operation in the city continues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-seven-months-end-year-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Pickton is one of the most notorious serial killers in Canadian history, bringing his victims to  his pig farm and feeding their remains to his animals. The 74-year-old had been serving a life sentence at Port-Cartier Institution in Canada\u2019s Quebec province after being convicted for six counts of second-degree murder in 2007. He sustained injuries from an assault involving another inmate on May 19 and died in hospital Friday, Correctional Service Canada (CSC) said. Pickton\u2019s next of kin has been notified and registered victims have also been contacted, CSC added, who said an investigation was underway. At least 65 women disappeared from Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside neighborhood in British Colombia province between 1978 and 2001 before Pickton was arrested. Pickton had been operating a pig farm in the nearby city of Port Coquitlam, where police found the remains of 33 women. However, Pickton confessed to murdering 49 women when talking to an undercover police officer in a jail cell. The case became the largest serial killer investigation in Canada\u2019s history and Pickton\u2019s pig farm became the largest crime scene in Canadian history, with investigators taking 200,000 DNA samples. Many of his victims were indigenous women, with police accused of not taking their cases seriously as many of those missing were prostitutes or drug addicts. In its release, CSC said, \u201cWe are mindful that this offender\u2019s case has had a devastating impact on communities in British Columbia and across the country, including Indigenous peoples, victims and their families. Our thoughts are with them.\u201d The news brought mixed emotions to the families of Pickton\u2019s victims.

Michele Pineault, the mother of Stephanie Lane, who was killed at age 20 but whose death Pickton was not charged for, told the newspaper that she was \u201celated\u201d by the death of \u201cthis animal\u201d as \u201cthere was no justice\u201d for her daughter.

The conviction \u2013 which has been heralded as a somber moment for America with wide-reaching implications \u2013 has been painted by Trump\u2019s allies in Europe as political persecution, aimed at derailing his bid to return to White House. Italy\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini called Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cjudicial harassment\u201d in a post on X, while Hungarian President Viktor Orban urged him to \u201ckeep on fighting\u201d for the presidency. But other countries declined to comment on the development \u2013 a conventional response for governments when asked about another nation\u2019s domestic matters. A Manhattan jury\u00a0found Trump guilty\u00a0of all 34 charges\u00a0of falsifying business records on Thursday, an unprecedented verdict that makes\u00a0him the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. The\u00a0verdict\u00a0was announced after jurors deliberated for nearly 12 hours over two days. It will ultimately be up to voters in November to decide the significance of the guilty verdict delivered by 12 ordinary New Yorkers, which, on a legal basis, does not prevent him from being elected president again. Salvini, who is a long-time supporter of the former president and visited him in Philadelphia,\u00a0Pennsylvania during his first presidential campaign, said Trump was a \u201cvictim of judicial harassment and a process of political nature.\u201d He wrote on X that \u201cin Italy, we are sadly familiar with the weaponization of the justice system by the left,\u201d which he said has for years tried to \u201celiminate political opponents through legal means.\u201d \u201cI hope Trump wins; it would be a guarantee of greater balance and hope for world peace,\u201d he added. Orb\u00e1n said he knew Trump to be \u201ca man of honour.\u201d \u201cAs president, he always put America first, he commanded respect around the world and used this respect to build peace,\u201d he said Friday in a\u00a0post\u00a0on \u2018X\u2019. \u201cLet the people make their verdict this November! Keep on fighting, Mr. President!\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Russia suggested there was a political conspiracy at play, despite Trump being convicted by a jury. \u201cIn general, if we talk about Trump, it is obvious that political rivals are being eliminated there through all legal and illegal means,\u201d President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a daily call to journalists. \u201cThis is visible to the whole world with the naked eye.\u201d Other countries, sticking to protocol, declined to comment on Trump\u2019s conviction.

Snapped while taking a stroll in New York City, the model, writer and actor was seen wearing a graphic T-shirt printed with Stormy Daniels face (Daniels is the adult film star and director who was allegedly paid $130,000 by Trump to keep quiet about an affair ahead of the 2016 election).

Fashion has long been an important vehicle for political expression, particularly for those in the spotlight.

Hammett later told the Guardian in 2018 she hid the top tightly under her jacket, only exposing the words when she was in front of a wall of cameras. Thatcher bent down to read her shirt and \u201clet out a squawk,\u201d Hammett said. Today, statements can range from the enigmatic to the undeniable. Ratajkowski herself is no stranger to the art of sartorial support, wearing a\u00a0conspicuous\u00a0Rage Against the Machine\u00a0T-shirt\u00a0in 2020\u00a0featuring a young Bernie Sanders. However in 2017,\u00a0while delivering a televised speech on Brexit legislation, the late Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 well versed in the semiotics of clothing \u2014\u00a0wore\u00a0a blue and yellow floral hat\u00a0that many\u00a0interpreted\u00a0as subtle\u00a0homage to the EU flag. Similarly, at the\u00a0Cannes Film Festival\u00a0earlier this month, many online questioned whether Cate Blanchett\u2019s Haider Ackermann dress was a tacit show of solidarity with Palestine amid the war in Gaza. The silk satin haute couture gown was half black and half blush-toned pink, with a striking emerald green lining only visible when she tossed her frock open. In an image captured by an elevated photographer, the pastel pink in Blanchett\u2019s gown appeared\u00a0almost\u00a0white \u2014 a combination of colors, especially considering the red carpet of the Promenade de la Croisette, was enough for some to\u00a0perceive\u00a0as a nod to the\u00a0de\u00a0facto\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0flag. Neither Blanchett nor Ackermann (who made the dress in January 2023,\u00a0some\u00a09 months before the October 7 attacks) issued an official statement on the dress. But in the digital age,\u00a0explicit displays of support are sometimes at risk of being censored. On Wednesday,\u00a0Vanity Fair France issued an apology\u00a0after\u00a0it was revealed that\u00a0the magazine had edited out a Palestinian pin worn by actor Guy Pearce during a photoshoot. \u201cAs the Palestinian people are already suffering great trauma and loss due to the vengeful regime of Netanyahu it is most unfortunate that a reputable publication like VF attempts to eliminate support that I or anyone chooses to offer,\u201d Pearce told CNN in an emailed statement. \u201cPersonally I think it is a disgrace.\u201d Hammett believes the quality of modern protest T-shirts have diminished to \u201cwatered-down messages,\u201d and while there is no striking statistic\u00a0or slogan\u00a0on Ratajkowski\u2019s top,\u00a0there\u2019s poetry in her choice of design.\u00a0Daniels, whose claims were long underestimated because of her career as a sex worker, refused to be pressured by a powerful man into silence. Similarly, Ratajkowski has spoken at length in her 2021 book \u201cMy Body\u201d about her experience enduring several instances of sexual assault. \u201cMy position brought me in close proximity to wealth and power and brought me some autonomy, but it hasn\u2019t resulted in true empowerment,\u201d wrote Ratajkowski in the opening to her book. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve gained only now, having written these essays and given voice to what I\u2019ve thought and experienced.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/style/emily-ratajkowski-stormy-daniels-sartorial-support/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_lgbtq-travel-destinations-homosexuality-criminalized", "text": "When Emma-Jane Nutbrown went on a family vacation to Jamaica last year, she did so with one condition: that everyone donated to an LGBTQ charity once they got there. Nutbrown felt uncomfortable with her parents\u2019 choice of destination. Same-sex sexual activity between men is against the law in Jamaica and carries a maximum jail term of 10 years with hard labor. Both Nutbrown and her brother, Simon \u2013 whose 40th birthday the family was celebrating on that trip \u2013 are gay. \u201cIt made Simon uneasy going there, but most people like to travel for the place, not the politics behind it, so we couldn\u2019t really hold my parents accountable,\u201d says Nutbrown, founder of Queer Edge, which creates safe spaces for the community in London. \u201cI won\u2019t refuse to travel somewhere with family, but I will raise it.\u00a0So instead of us refusing to go, Simon made everyone donate to a charity out there as his birthday present.\u201d Nutbrown and her brother are some of the millions worldwide who have an extra layer to consider when booking a vacation: Will they be safe in the destination, and how are local members of the LGBTQ community treated? \u201cI\u2019m predominantly against it [travel to destinations where homosexuality is banned], but I\u2019m pragmatic. It\u2019s not as easy as \u2018Don\u2019t go,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cIf there was a shared consensus across the planet [to boycott destinations] then it would work, but I think it\u2019s a lot more complex.\u201d There are 62 countries worldwide that still criminalize (or de facto criminalize) homosexuality, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), which counts UN member states. The Human Dignity Trust counts 64. Of these, 12 could potentially impose the death penalty for same-sex activity, including tourist favorite the United Arab Emirates; Qatar, whose airline was this week deemed the best in the world; Nigeria, which welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May; and Saudi Arabia, which last year claimed that it welcomed LGBTQ travelers. Many people \u2013 even those outside the LGBTQ community \u2013 simply will not travel to countries where homosexuality is illegal. Corey O\u2019Neill, an office manager from London, is one. \u201cSafety is at the forefront of anyone\u2019s mind when traveling,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not visibly queer, there\u2019s an innate danger that how you act might be perceived as gay, which entails not only formal punishments, but police brutality, hate crimes, the general atmosphere. I don\u2019t want to have that in my mind on vacation.\u201d O\u2019Neill\u2019s stance means that unless laws change, he will never see the pyramids (Egypt has de-facto criminalized homosexuality with jail-term punishment); sleep overwater in the Maldives (up to eight years jail-time plus 100 lashes); take a Kenyan safari (maximum 14 years imprisonment); see Red Square (Russia designates the LGBTQ movement \u2013 even displaying a rainbow flag \u2013 as \u2018extremist\u2019 with up to 12-year sentences); or stop over in Qatar (up to 10 years in prison, with \u201cno legal certainty\u201d over a potential death penalty). But he\u2019s OK with that. \u201cWhy would I give money to a country that doesn\u2019t want me to exist? Even if $10 went towards a tax that actively harmed people, that\u2019d be my money I gave them.\u201d It\u2019s not just LGBTQ people who feel this way. Members and allies of the community are currently in their 10th year of boycotting the Dorchester Collection hotels, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (part of the Ministry of Finance and Economy), since the country introduced laws authorizing the stoning to death of LGBTQ people, as well as the public flogging of women for adultery. In 2019, George Clooney wrote of the importance of boycotting. But while a boycott may be possible against a business, some feel that swerving an entire country harms the local community even more. \u201cIt can cause a very visceral reaction in people, but there are 50 shades of discrimination, and the challenge is where you draw the line,\u201d says Darren Burn, founder of inclusive travel companies Out of Office and TravelGay. \u201cWould you go somewhere you can\u2019t get married, or can\u2019t go into the army? The reality is there are loads of places where, even if it\u2019s not illegal to be gay, there are challenges. I totally respect that some people don\u2019t want to support an economy where [homosexuality] is illegal. But the other side is that I want to go, and by going, I\u2019m helping to change mindsets. Every country has gay people. We hear from staff members and locals in destinations, who say, \u2018Please come.\u2019 \u201d Burn never planned to enter the travel industry. He was a journalist when he went on holiday to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. \u201cI was in my early 20s, and I was a bit na\u00efve. It was Sharm \u2013 a tourist haven,\u201d he says. \u201cI was traveling with my ex, and we weren\u2019t allowed to check in. We had to go to another hotel. I thought, that shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone, ever.\u201d In 2016, he founded Out of Office, building a contact book of \u201cwelcoming suppliers and tour guides.\u201d \u2018Do you need two beds?\u2019 In recent years, destination marketers have become more vociferous in attracting LGBTQ clients. There\u2019s usually a financial reason behind it, says Burn. Travelers from the community \u201care less likely to have children and more likely to have disposable income. They\u2019re loyal customers and trust word-of-mouth referrals.\u201d Sherwin Banda, president of luxury safari provider African Travel Inc says that the LGBTQ community has \u201cthe largest disposable income of any other niche market.\u201d \u201cA destination\u2019s reputation as being LGBT-friendly is a primary motivation for us,\u201d he says. A 2021 report from nonprofit Open for Business showed that Caribbean nations outlawing homosexuality saw their GDP hit by up to 5.7% and lost the tourist industry $423 million to $689 million annually. In Jamaica,\u00a0tourism officials\u00a0have tried to downplay the impact of the island nation\u2019s laws against homosexuality. In 2022, legislation was repealed in Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Trinidad and Tobago had already decriminalized same-sex relations in 2018; in April 2024, Dominica followed suit. \u201cThe Caribbean is moving quite quickly,\u201d says Burn, who adds that the anti-homosexuality laws in many Caribbean and African countries were established under European colonialism. Banda, who is South African, agrees. \u201cColonial laws combined with stringent religious beliefs have prolonged a stigma attached to homosexuality across Africa,\u201d he says. However, he is still comfortable arranging safaris for LGBTQ travelers. \u201cOnce we know travelers are from the community, we take great care to ensure guides, hotels, all the touchpoints throughout the journey are safe for them, but also inclusive,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody will say, \u2018Do you need two beds?\u2019 We ensure our clients don\u2019t have to come out again to everyone they meet in Africa.\u201d \u2018Tolerance is practiced not preached\u2019 The experience on the ground is often different from the letter of the law. As Burn says, \u201cIt\u2019s also illegal to drink alcohol in the Maldives, but all resorts have it.\u201d (He advises not holding hands at the airport, however.) In 2020, Bilal El Hammoumy and Rania Chentouf launched Inclusive Morocco, the first LGBT-founded tour operator in a country that punishes same-sex activity with up to three years in jail. \u201cBeing members of the community, we felt we would understand better how to approach it,\u201d says El Hammoumy. \u201cMorocco is a country where tolerance is practiced but not preached. \u201cWe could understand clients\u2019 fears, but on the other hand, it was important to create a space where the local LGBT community can be involved in training programs and hiring opportunities.\u201d El Hammoumy says that in Morocco, \u201cthe reality is a bit different from the law.\u201d In the early 20th century, cities such as Tangier were \u201cgay heavens\u201d for creatives escaping conservative Western countries. One of Marrakech\u2019s main sights is the Majorelle Garden, where the ashes of former owner Yves Saint Laurent were scattered by his former partner, Pierre Berg\u00e9. El Hammoumy says that Moroccan hotels are generally accepting of same-sex couples, but those they work with have extra training to ensure travelers are comfortable. Some guides have opted not to work with them when they explain their clientele, he says. However, he says that visiting destinations can change mindsets. \u201cA lot of anti-LGBT feelings come from prejudice and a lack of education, and direct contact can change preconceived ideas about the community,\u201d he says. Burn agrees. There\u2019s the economic incentive, too. Banda, who grew up under apartheid, believes that South Africa would not have changed without economic pressure from the wider world. \u201cTravel does something no other industry can do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfrica is heavily dependent on tourism dollars. We can advocate for inclusivity with partners who are prepared to actively welcome our guests. If we stay away, we lose that opportunity to use our voice.\u201d Travel can \u2018bring change\u2019 Does that mean every country should be showered in travel dollars in a bid to change opinions? Not according to these experts, none of whom would send a client to Saudi Arabia. Uganda is another sticking point \u2013 its 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act legalized the targeting of the LGBTQ community in myriad ways and even carries the death sentence. \u201cAs a company, you need to stand for something, and Uganda advocates for brutal violent acts against gay people. We cannot in good conscience send people there,\u201d says Banda. Michael Kajubi has a different perspective. In 2013 he founded McBern Tours, curating Uganda tours, after being fired from his previous job because of \u201csuspicions\u201d that he was gay. \u201cI had to start a company to employ myself and people like me who could not get jobs because of who they are,\u201d he says. The majority of McBern staff are LGBTQ, and all profits go to the McBern Foundation, which supports elderly Ugandans and marginalized youths. Kajubi \u2013 who left Uganda four years ago because of his activism \u2013 says that he is still comfortable sending LGBTQ travelers there, as long as they \u201crespect the laws \u2013 don\u2019t wave their rainbow flag all over the place.\u201d All the hotels that McBern uses \u2013 even for straight guests \u2013 have been carefully vetted as LGBTQ-friendly, says Kajubi. He believes travelers should still visit these destinations but be vigilant where their money is going. He suggests looking for tour operators affiliated to the IGLTA, so that you can be sure you\u2019re not funding inequality. Boycotting leaves the local community stranded, he argues. Companies that have stopped working with McBern because of Uganda\u2019s anti-gay legislation \u201chave a valid point, but supporting local companies can bring change. You\u2019re paying salaries for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be employed.  \u201cIf people don\u2019t come we can\u2019t support [Foundation] beneficiaries with healthcare, tuition and basic needs.\u201d \u2018Discrimination all over the place\u2019 Of course, discrimination isn\u2019t confined to countries where homosexuality is illegal. For starters, over 500 anti-LGBTQ laws were introduced in US state legislatures last year alone. In May, the US State Department issued a worldwide alert about potential attacks on LGBTQ+ people and events. In 2014, Matthieu Jost founded MisterB&B, an LGBTQ travel community with 1.3 million members, after an Airbnb host in Barcelona made it clear that he and his partner were unwelcome. Previously, a French hotel had refused him and his then-boyfriend a double bed. \u201cThis kind of discrimination is all over the place, even in 2024,\u201d says Jost, who won\u2019t even hold hands with his partner in Paris. Banda won\u2019t do that in Los Angeles, either. For Jost, traveling to a country where homosexuality is banned means abiding by local rules. MisterB&B users are not allowed to book travel in a country with the death penalty for same-sex behavior. In a destination where it\u2019s illegal, users are flagged before booking. \u201cWe warn travelers they need to be cautious. Ask for separate beds, don\u2019t show personal gestures, let family know where they\u2019re traveling and have the embassy contact,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you really want to go there, you need to respect the laws and religion of these countries and play the game.\u201d Burn adds that booking with a specialist is essential \u2013 his staff have mystery-shopped mainstream tour operators and found them lacking in knowledge, he says. For O\u2019Neill, and many like him, it\u2019s not enough. \u201cI know it limits where I can go \u2013 I\u2019ll probably never see the pyramids or go on safari. But there are so many beautiful places in the world that support queer people. That sounds like a much nicer vacation to me.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/lgbtq-travel-destinations-homosexuality-criminalized/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_31_tech_fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close", "text": "The Affordable Connectivity Program, which helped low-income Americans get online, is no more. On Friday, the US government announced the final closure of the broadly popular federal program, which has helped tens of millions of households afford internet service, after Republicans in Congress ignored calls by consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers to approve more funding this spring. The program\u2019s lapse threatens to throw nearly 60 million Americans into financial distress,\u00a0CNN has reported. The program officially ends on June 1, said the Federal Communications Commission, which administered the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to approximately 1 in 5 households\u00a0across the country and\u00a0on tribal reservations. The 2.5-year-old ACP provided eligible low-income Americans with a monthly credit off their internet bills, worth up to $30 per month and as much as $75 per month for households on tribal lands. The pandemic-era program was a hit with members of both political parties and served tens of millions of seniors, veterans and rural and urban Americans alike. Program participants received\u00a0only partial benefits\u00a0in May ahead of the ACP\u2019s expected collapse. \u201cThe Affordable Connectivity Program filled an important gap that provider low-income programs, state and local affordability programs, and the Lifeline program cannot fully address,\u201d said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement, referring to the name of another, similar FCC program that subsidizes wireless and home internet service. \u201cThe Commission is available to provide any assistance Congress may need to support funding the ACP in the future and stands ready to resume the program if additional funding is provided.\u201d Some US lawmakers proposed bipartisan legislation to extend the ACP in the months leading up to the deadline. But the bills languished in the face of inaction by Republican leaders who showed little interest in engaging with the issue. President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have\u00a0publicly blamed\u00a0GOP leadership for allowing the ACP to end. A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Biden reiterated his calls for Congress to pass legislation extending the ACP. He also announced a series of voluntary commitments by a handful of internet providers to offer \u2014 or continue offering \u2014 their own proprietary low-income internet plans.The list includes AT&T, Comcast, Cox, Charter\u2019s Spectrum and Verizon, among others. Those providers will continue to offer qualifying ACP households a broadband plan for $30 or less, the White House said, and together the companies are expected to cover roughly 10 million of the 23 million households relying on the ACP. The ACP was initially funded by Congress with a one-time budget of $14 billion. Biden has asked for $6 billion to continue the program and one bipartisan bill proposed renewing the ACP with $7 billion in additional funding. Kathryn de Wit, director of the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s broadband access initiative, said reaching the deadline without a solution from Congress was a \u201cdisheartening\u201d outcome. \u201cWithout intervention, households participating in the program will immediately see their internet bills go up,\u201d de Wit said. \u201cWe know cost is a key barrier to connecting low-income families to the internet, so without ACP we can expect most participating households to either downgrade or drop their plans altogether.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_china_dong-jun-china-defense-minister-shangrila-intl-hnk", "text": "Taiwan is pursuing independence incrementally and those who support it will \u201cend up in self-destruction,\u201d China\u2019s new defense minister warned Sunday in a wide-ranging speech at a security summit in Singapore where the extent of regional tensions was on stark display. Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun made the comments in a roughly 30-minute speech which comes days after Beijing staged major military exercises encircling the island of Taiwan after it inaugurated its new, democratically elected president last month. \u201cWe will take resolute actions to curb Taiwan independence and make sure such a plot never succeeds,\u201d Dong said speaking through a translator, while slamming \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan, in an apparent reference to the United States, which maintains close, unofficial ties with Taiwan. \u201cChina stays committed to peaceful reunification. However, this prospect is increasingly being eroded by separatists for Taiwan independence and foreign forces,\u201d Dong warned. His comments come as there has been heightened concern in the region over Beijing\u2019s military and economic intimidation of Taiwan, which has grown more pronounced under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In a meeting with Dong on Friday, US defense chief Lloyd Austin called on China not to \u201cuse Taiwan\u2019s political transition \u2014 part of a normal, routine democratic process \u2014 as a pretext for coercive measures.\u201d China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it and has vowed to \u201creunify\u201d with it, by force if necessary. Taiwan\u2019s new President Lai Ching-te and his party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), are both openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. Lai has said he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that \u201cTaiwan is already an independent sovereign country\u201d so there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence. The US also by longstanding policy does not support Taiwan independence nor the unilateral change of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. \u201cThe DPP authorities in Taiwan are pursuing separation in an incremental way. They are bent on erasing their Chinese identity of Taiwan and severing social, historical and cultural links across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Dong said, reiterating Beijing\u2019s rhetoric that they would be\u00a0\u201cnailed to the pillar of shame in history.\u201d Polls show growing numbers of the island\u2019s people \u2013 especially young people \u2013 view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of China, an authoritarian one-party state compared to Taiwan\u2019s democracy. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and only 3% identify primarily as Chinese \u2013 while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese. Taiwan called Dong\u2019s comments in Singapore \u201cprovocative and irrational.\u201d \u201cAny\u2026 coercive actions that disregard public opinion run contrary to democracy and human rights, or any resort to war will eventually be counterproductive,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement. Dong, a former naval commander, is making his debut at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit after being appointed to his position late last year following a surprise shake-up at the top of China\u2019s Defense Ministry. The gathering plays out amid a contentious security landscape across the region, where China is widely seen by its neighbors as using its military might to assert disputed territorial claims and bid for military prominence in a part of the world where the US has deep security ties. Chinese vessels and aircraft have been widely documented patrolling and making aggressive maneuvers against others operating in international waters and skies as it asserts disputed claims in the East and South China Seas. But Dong painted a different vision of China in his speech, framing it as a benign power whose military \u201cnever acts from the so-called position of strength,\u201d while taking oblique aim at the US saying, \u201cwe will not allow anyone to bring geopolitical conflicts or any war, whether hot or cold to our region.\u201d A \u2018limit\u2019 to restraint The Chinese defense chief also said there was a \u201climit to\u201d China\u2019s restraint when it comes to \u201cprovocations\u201d in the South China Sea, making an apparent reference to US treaty ally the Philippines, which Dong did not name directly. A \u201ccertain country\u201d was \u201cemboldened\u201d by outside powers and had \u201cmade mediated provocations,\u201d Dong said, while indirectly referencing the deployment of an American missile system during military drills in the Philippines in April. China has militarized islands in the disputed South China Sea, and in recent months its coast guard has fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas, further ratcheting tensions in the key strategic waterway. China claims historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea, despite a 2016 ruling at an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines against that claim. Dong\u2019s comments come after Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr on Friday denounced illegal, coercive and aggressive actions in the South China Sea at the opening of the same defense forum in Singapore. He also warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. The Chinese defense chief also pushed back against concerns voiced by the US that dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia\u2019s defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine. \u201cWe have never provided weapons to either party of the conflict. We have put stricter control on the export of dual-use\u00a0items and have never done anything to fan the flames,\u201d Dong said. The issue was raised during a meeting between Dong and US counterpart Austin \u2013 the first face-to-face talks between US and Chinese defense since 2022, with Austin indicating to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily. Dong said China \u201cstays open to exchanges and cooperation with the US military.\u201d The annual security forum in Singapore \u2013 which is hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) \u2013 is a rare gathering of senior military officials from across the Asia-Pacific region, including those who are geopolitical rivals or view each other warily. It is also a rare opportunity to hear from, and pose questions to, senior Chinese military leaders. Many of the questions directed at Dong from delegates revolved around China\u2019s increased assertiveness throughout the region, particularly towards Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea. Robert Ward, IISS Japan chair, told CNN he felt Dong\u2019s tone was \u201cmore shrill\u201d than he\u2019s seen in previous speeches by Chinese defense chiefs at the gathering. \u201cThe strategic environment in Asia has actually got more tense and I think we saw that in the Chinese defense minister\u2019s speech today,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThe tone was far harder this year than it was last year,\u201d he added. Meanwhile a senior US official had the following assessment. \u201cEvery year for three years, a new Chinese defense minister has come to Shangri-La,\u201d the official told CNN. \u201cAnd every year, they\u2019ve given a speech at complete odds with the reality of the PLA\u2019s coercive activity across the region. This year was no different.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/china/dong-jun-china-defense-minister-shangrila-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_americas_mexico-election-explainer-intl-latam", "text": "On June 2, Mexicans will vote to pick their next president in a historic race that could see a woman take the top job for the first time. In addition to the presidency, there are more than 20,000 positions to fill and an estimated 70,000 candidates vying for those offices, including 128 senate seats and 500 deputy seats; the mayorship of Mexico City; and governor\u2019s offices in Chiapas, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, Puebla, Tabasco, Veracruz and Yucat\u00e1n. Here\u2019s who is running for president: Claudia Sheinbaum The 61-year-old Sheinbaum is a former Mexico City mayor and climate scientist. A longtime political ally of incumbent President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, she was the\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0environment secretary\u00a0from 2000-2006\u00a0when he\u00a0was mayor. If she wins, Sheinbaum would be not only the first female president in Mexico, but the first president with Jewish heritage, although she rarely speaks publicly about her personal background and has governed as a secular leftist. Her close alignment with L\u00f3pez Obrador has been both a blessing and a curse politically. Sheinbaum has said she\u2019s\u00a0\u201cnot a close copy\u201d of L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 but she also doesn\u2019t shy away from touting the principles they share, even repeating his slogans on the campaign trail. (L\u00f3pez Obrador has repeatedly dismissed whispers that he favors a candidate that he could influence, telling press in February that he would \u201cretire completely\u201d after his term.) Among her policies,\u00a0Sheinbaum has promised: \u2022 Continuing Lopez Obrador\u2019s pension for all senior citizens\u2022 Scholarships for more than 12 million students\u2022 Free fertilizers for small farm owners\u2022 On security, she proposed consolidating\u00a0the\u00a0National Guard, reform of judiciary, strengthening intelligence and research and coordination with law enforcement authorities. X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez Backed by an opposition coalition of Mexico\u2019s PRI, PAN and PRD parties, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez is a former senator and previously served as the top official for indigenous affairs under former President Vicente Fox. The daughter of an indigenous father and a mixed-race mother, the 61-year-old was a businesswoman before entering politics. For a relative newcomer, Galvez\u2019s entry into the presidential race has\u00a0gained impressive momentum, experts say. Her proposals include: \u2022 Continuing Lopez Obrador\u2019s pension for all senior citizens\u2022 A \u201cuniversal social protection system\u201d of welfare programs for middle and lower classes\u2022 A security approach that would strengthen local and state police\u2022 Galvez has also hinted that that oil-rich Mexico should invest more in renewable energy, saying earlier this year: \u201cWe haven\u2019t done it because we are dumbasses.\u201d Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez A late entrant in the race, Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez shot to international attention earlier this month, when a stage collapsed at his campaign event in the northeastern city of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, killing nine people and leaving at least 121 people injured. The 38-year-old has pledged to: \u2022 Eliminate the crime of simple drug possession to to stop criminalizing poverty, and move from prohibitionism to regulation of drugs\u2022 End the\u00a0longstanding militarization of Mexico\u00a0and instead focus on training and strengthening police\u2022 He has also proposed a gradual economic reform\u00a0including\u00a0a universal pension system, guaranteed labor rights and income and progressive tax reform\u2022 M\u00e1ynez\u00a0has also called for\u00a0transforming the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) and Pemex into renewable and clean energy companies,\u00a0and\u00a0for closing some refineries The key issues: Security and migration Security and immigration are top issues for all of Mexico\u2019s presidential candidates. Campaigning in the run-up to the election has been marred by dozens of assassination attempts and other political violence. There are concerns now that that the attacks have already\u00a0cooled off campaigns; experts and political parties say some candidates have renounced their bids in fear of their lives. But electoral violence is just a part of Mexico\u2019s broader security crisis, with sky-high\u00a0crime\u00a0and\u00a0homicide rates.\u00a0In the first four and a half years of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government,\u00a0160,594 homicides were recorded\u00a0\u2013 a figure surpassing that\u00a0of\u00a0the previous administration. However, a report from the Mexican Peace Index (MPI), prepared by the\u00a0Institute for Economy and Peace\u00a0(IEP), has\u00a0offered\u00a0some reason for optimism, reporting improvements in\u00a0five key indicators: homicides, crimes with violence, fear of violence, crimes committed with firearms, and crimes of violence.\u00a0Homicides and crimes committed with\u00a0firearms peaked\u00a0in 2019, according to the May 2024 report,\u00a0and have since improved. Meanwhile, pressure is growing on Mexico\u2019s southern and northern borders. In 2023, the National Migration Institute (INM) recorded a\u00a077% increase in migrant arrivals compared to 2022. And as it grapples with the surge of migrants and asylum seekers entering and crossing its own territory, Mexico will also have to contend with external policies on migration. As an example, Myriam Guadalupe Castro Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, an academic at the National School of Social Work of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), points to a recent state law in Texas that has already caused waves in Mexico. In December, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u00a0signed a bill\u00a0that would allow state officials to detain and deport people suspected of having entered the United States illegally. The law is currently blocked in a US federal court, but the L\u00f3pez Obrador government has warned that it will not receive people deported by Texas and that it will only discuss immigration issues with Washington. Both Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez have stated their support for this stance.

{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_far-right-european-election-intl", "text": "This is a historic and pivotal year for democracy across the globe. Around\u00a070 countries\u00a0\u2013 from the\u00a0United States\u00a0to\u00a0South Africa, via\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0\u2013 will hold elections in 2024. After India\u2019s huge and ongoing six-week ballot, however, the biggest election in terms of voter numbers will happen next week, when 373 million Europeans can go to the polls and elect 720 members of the next European Parliament. Once the votes have been tallied from across the 27-nation bloc, it is widely expected that the results will show a significant shift to the right, which could have major implications for the political direction of the European Union at a time\u00a0when it is battling\u00a0multiple crises,\u00a0many of them global. From the war in Ukraine to coping with mass migration, the rise of China to the threat of climate change, it\u2019s hard to see how a bloc of\u00a0diverse\u00a0countries could possibly speak with one voice. Of course, differences in opinion among\u00a0the\u00a0member states is nothing new. EU politics has always relied on awkward alliances between countries and political ideologies that represent vastly different electorates. The EU\u2019s political center has undeniably moved to the right over the past two decades,\u00a0however. The European Parliament is the place where this is most visible at an EU level. Most\u00a0of the lawmakers (known as MEPs)\u00a0belong to a political party in their own country.\u00a0Once they enter\u00a0the European Parliament\u00a0in the Belgian capital of Brussels, they sit in loose, multinational political groupings that broadly have similar political interests. These groupings then form even looser coalitions,\u00a0which\u00a0usually results with a majority grouping of centrists from the center-left, center-right and liberals somewhere in the middle. The rightward shift of the political center in this coalition has been gradual. In 1994, the main socialist group S&D had the most MEPs. In 1999,\u00a0it was\u00a0overtaken by the center-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP). The EPP, best explained as conservatives in the mold of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u00a0has\u00a0been the dominant force in\u00a0EU\u00a0politics ever since. While the EPP has been able to lead a mainstream centrist coalition with the left and liberals at a European level, MEPs are still beholden to domestic politics happening back in their own countries. For example, it\u2019s not easy for a conservative to work with a liberal on a pan-EU policy that would share the burden of asylum seekers if voters back home are becoming attracted to loud, anti-immigration populists. The louder the domestic noise \u2013 and the greater the risk of losing their own seat in parliament \u2013 the trickier cross-party politics at a Brussels level becomes. The anticipated influx of\u00a0lawmakers into groups\u00a0to the EPP\u2019s right will\u00a0certainly\u00a0complicate matters. While the\u00a0right-wing\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and\u00a0far-right\u00a0Identity and Democracy (ID)\u00a0groups\u00a0are expected to finish fourth and fifth respectively in terms of seat numbers, their combined tally, which could be upwards of 140,\u00a0according to the Politico Poll of Polls, will be hard for the EPP to ignore.\u00a0The EPP is currently predicted to win 165 seats to 143 for the socialist S&D. ECR and ID are typical of European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0parties in that they are home to a pretty broad group of conservatives. The ECR, for example, was founded by former British Prime Minister David Cameron who campaigned against Brexit. Its current chair is Italian PM Georgia Meloni, who garnered lots of attention during the 2022 Italian election for her opposition to\u00a0LGBTQ+\u00a0rights,\u00a0promises to curb migration and general anti-globalist rhetoric. However, since\u00a0Meloni\u2019s\u00a0election, she has been seen as considerably more moderate and has supported many key EU initiatives, including support for Ukraine. She has also resisted allowing\u00a0authoritarian\u00a0Hungarian\u00a0leader\u00a0Viktor Orban to join the ECR after he left the EPP. Hungary has been the most pro-Russia EU voice since the start of the war. Whether or not it was deliberate on Meloni\u2019s part, resistance to Orban has made working with her and the ECR more palatable to the Brussels establishment, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ID, too, has sought to moderate its image. It\u00a0recently expelled\u00a0the German far-right AfD party from its ranks after one of its most senior MEPs told an Italian newspaper\u00a0that he didn\u2019t see all members of the SS, the notorious Nazi paramilitary group, automatically as criminals. There is quite a wide range in opinion from the moderate wing of the ERC to the fringes of ID, but political\u00a0currents\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0desire for influence\u00a0can result in some\u00a0odd bedfellows, especially in the opaque and fluid world of European politics. It is unlikely that the EPP would be willing to work directly with ID any time soon, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be important. History has shown us repeatedly that it\u2019s possible to influence policy from outside the tent. Suppose\u00a0that\u00a0parties associated with ID start putting center-right\u00a0politicians\u00a0under pressure in their own countries. You might find the center adopts their policy ideas \u2013\u00a0as has previously happened in France, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and Germany. And there are\u00a0more than\u00a0enough hot topics in Europe now for the right to get its teeth stuck into. Migration, climate change, border security, military spending, rule of law \u2013 all of these have been flashpoints in pan-Europe politics for a long time and are not going away any time soon. And it is ultimately the newly-elected Parliament that vets and approves the\u00a0make-up\u00a0of the\u00a0European\u00a0Commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive body. It\u2019s worth noting that support for Ukraine is expected to be safe\u00a0for the time being, with the pro-Kremlin\u00a0groups appearing\u00a0very\u00a0isolated. But almost everything else will be handled on a case-by-case basis if the numbers work out that way. And the more MEPs elected that are to the right of the EPP, the more their influence could grow over time. Five years is a long time in politics, and that is how long this Parliament will last. In that time, France will hold an election that Marine Le Pen, who is affiliated with ID, might win\u00a0with her National Rally party. Geert Wilders, also ID, is soon expected to form a government in the Netherlands after emerging as the biggest party in their\u00a0November\u00a0elections. In other words, the domestic politics in member states could shift even further to the right, which naturally changes calculations in Brussels. The European Parliament\u00a0can often seem like\u00a0looks\u00a0like a boring, bureaucratic blob, tediously grinding its way through process. But the EU is an increasingly geopolitical player \u2013 able to impose sanctions on Russian and Chinese political figures, provide funds to Ukraine and use its economic heft as the world\u2019s largest trading bloc in diplomacy. If its political center is indeed shifting to the right, its influence will inevitably have\u00a0meaningful\u00a0and\u00a0perhaps far-reaching\u00a0consequences for people\u00a0living beyond Europe\u2019s\u00a0borders.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/far-right-european-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_asia_japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk", "text": "Wearing a toy whale hat, whale tie and a whale motif shirt, Hideki Tokoro spends much of his days thinking about the world\u2019s largest mammals. But he doesn\u2019t want to protect them. He wants to hunt them. To do that his company Kyodo Senpaku has built and launched a brand-new whaling $48 million \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters as he escorted them around the 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel that set sail last Saturday for an eight-month tour of the country\u2019s northern waters. The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists. The Kangei Maru is bigger and faster than its predecessor, the company says, and is equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews of smaller boats to quickly locate and kill whales. But activists say the ship\u2019s high-powered features, including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days, suggests that Japan is setting its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson told CNN. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, (and) what the whalers are doing right now is really just a test run. They are testing out the new ship in their waters.\u201d \u2018We need to cull whales\u2019 The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size\u00a0of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. \u201cWhales are at the top of the food chain. They compete with humans by eating marine creatures that should be feeding other fish,\u201d Tokoro said on the tour. \u201cWe need to cull whales to keep the balance of the ecosystem \u2013 it\u2019s our job and mission to protect oceans for the future.\u201d He also told CNN that most of the ship\u2019s catch would be killed \u201calmost instantly\u201d by cannons at sea. \u201cWe aim for perfection, but some of them may suffer. In such cases, we will use a rifle to finish the job.\u201d Besides objecting to the slaughter one of the ocean\u2019s most majestic creatures, marine conservation groups and scientists have highlighted the important role which whales play in helping to tackle the climate crisis through sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions. \u201cWhales are not just consumers in ocean eco-systems \u2013 they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment which helps stimulate plant-life growth,\u201d\u00a0said marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender, also rejecting pro-whaling arguments that commercial hunts could be \u201csustainable.\u201d \u201cHumans have a very long history of killing whales and have not done a good job of being able to sustainably harvest animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to sustainably harvest a wild animal like that.\u201d Why is Japan so determined to keep whaling? Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 under a moratorium by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) after whale populations were almost driven to extinction by humans. Japan is one of three countries \u2013 along with Norway and Iceland \u2013 that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. Iceland, which has fiercely defended commercial whaling, said it would end whaling in 2024, citing falling demand for whale meat as well as \u201chigh operation costs and little proof of any economic advantage.\u201d Commercial whaling continues in Norway, which experts say has quietly become the world\u2019s leading whaling nation \u2013 killing more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. For decades, Japan has justified whaling under the guise of \u201cscientific research.\u201d In 2018, it tried one last time to persuade the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling \u2013 and failed. So, it withdrew from the body and resumed commercial whaling months later, in defiance of international criticism. \u201cJapan is no longer party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and can argue that it is no longer bound by provisions and constraints,\u201d Donald Rothwell, an international law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), told CNN. \u201cWithin its waters, it\u00a0has the absolute authority to control the management of living resources \u2013 and that includes whales.\u201d Under Japanese law, three species of whale are permitted to be hunted in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones \u2013 endangered sei whales and threatened minke whales and Bryde\u2019s whales, with endangered fin whales set to be added to kill lists. \u201cWhales are important food resources and should be sustainably utilized based on scientific evidence,\u201d said government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi this month, as he announced a proposal to hunt fin whales, the second-largest species of whales after blue whales. The World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) marine conservation group said that whale watching in Japan was \u201ca far more successful industry\u201d than harvesting whale meat. \u201cCommercial whaling in the 21st century is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cThe whaling industry in Japan recognizes that it is a challenge to increase whale meat consumption and there is currently no market,\u201d WCA said. \u201cSo why keep slaughtering these wonderful and intelligent animals?\u201d Tokoro ruled out whale watching. \u201cWe will not switch to whale watching but eating whale meat while watching whales might be quite a nice touch,\u201d he told CNN. Demand for whale meat in Japan Over the years, Kyodo Senpaku has launched aggressive public relation campaigns to promote whale meat and win over new generations of young diners. Tokoro says he eats whale meat every day. \u201cWhale meat is not only delicious, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Tokoro told reporters during the tour of his ship, as he talked\u00a0up the purported \u201chealth benefits\u201d of eating whale, claiming that the meat could cure hair loss and cancer. \u201cI can definitely say whale meat and rice is a really good (combination) for Japanese people. There is no doubt about that, much better than beef and bun.\u201d Last year Tokoro, again wearing his whale hat, launched controversial whale meat vending machines, offering whale sashimi, whale steak and whale bacon. The company has also sponsored influencers from countries such as Russia, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 hosting them at a local izakaya in Osaka, where they sampled dishes like whale sashimi and skewers and encouraging them to take the message back to their followers that whale meat was delicious and acceptable. Japan may have a long and storied history of whaling dating back to the Edo period in the 1600s, but experts say whale meat consumption only really peaked after World War II \u2013 when food sources, especially protein, were scarce. Today, whale meat is now\u00a0considered more of a \u201cluxury\u201d dish, said Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor at the National Museum of Ethnology, one of the country\u2019s largest research institutes. \u201cThe fact is that there is little interest in whaling and whale meat among Japanese people as a whole,\u201d Kishigami told CNN. \u201cMost young people, especially the majority that live in cities, do not know or care much about whaling and its history and remain indifferent.\u201d The same goes for dolphin meat, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. But if we were asked to stop eating blue fin tuna, there would be a huge uproar. We would react very badly to that.\u201d Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry estimates that between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of whale meat are consumed annually in the country, compared to average annual totals of more than 230,000 tons during the 1960s. \u201cThere is still certainly a market (for whale meat in Japan) but market size and production volume have shrunk dramatically,\u201d economics professor Mitsuhiro Kishimoto from the Shimonoseki City University told CNN, noting that several major whaling companies had since withdrawn from the trade. \u201cThe demand for whale blubber disappeared after the discovery of oil and petroleum products, so many countries stopped whaling and with international regulations, the number of caught whales decreased and as a result, whale meat production decreased while beef, pork and chicken became more popular,\u201d he said. Scientists have also expressed\u00a0concern about the risks of consuming whale meat, with studies pointing to high levels of mercury found in whale and dolphin meat, which could prove dangerous to consumers \u2013 especially pregnant women and young children. Could Japanese whalers return to the Southern Ocean? Located in deep waters surrounding the entire continent of Antarctica, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hosts dozens of whale species including humpbacks, blue whales and fin whales. It was established by the IWC in 1994 to protect whale species after centuries of hunting, but until 2019 Japan took regular trips to the region to hunt for self-stated \u201cscientific research\u201d purposes. Japanese whalers killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean in 2018/2019, according to the IWC, before abandoning the region after it left the international body. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Tokoro told CNN that the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cCommercial whaling is not profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 50 days to get to the Antarctic and back and we are not confident we can make a profit by paying the wages of employees and fuel for 50 days. However, I will go only when the government orders me to go \u2026 Until then, I will not go commercial whaling at all.\u201d But\u00a0activists aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s long-range capabilities and drones, and recent announcements from Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry that it is keen to start hunting fin whales, we believe there is a high likelihood that Japanese whalers will return to the Southern Ocean,\u201d said James Anderson, activist and founder of the Whale Defense Agency (WDA). \u201cThe Southern Ocean is a critical habitat for many whale species that provides a safe haven for breeding and feeding \u2026 protecting it is more important than ever due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and illegal whaling.\u201d Rothwell, from ANU, said that if Japan looks to kill whales beyond its territorial waters, it can expect an international response. \u201cIt would immediately trigger global interest and action about the conservation and protection of whales, especially in waters sanctioned by the IWC as a whale sanctuary,\u201d Rothwell said. Watson, the veteran anti-whaling activist, told CNN he\u2019s prepared to mount a physical response \u2013 with a former Japanese fisheries patrol vessel he\u2019s acquired in anticipation of Japanese whalers returning to the Antarctic by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for a reason \u2013 you don\u2019t kill whales there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe want to be able to track them down and intercept them like we\u2019ve done before \u2013 and we are more than prepared to do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/asia/japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_style_vanity-fair-france-guy-pearce-cec", "text": "Vanity Fair France has issued an apology after editing a photo of actor Guy Pearce, in which a Palestinian flag pin he wore on his suit jacket is not visible. The move, which was quickly called out on social media, has been labeled by some as an attempt at censorship. \u201cAs the Palestinian people are already suffering great trauma and loss due to the vengeful regime of Netanyahu it is most unfortunate that a reputable publication like VF attempts to eliminate support that I or anyone chooses to offer,\u201d Pearce told CNN in an emailed statement. \u201cPersonally I think it is a disgrace.\u201d Pearce was featured in Vanity Fair France last week as part of a series of actor portraits at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, which wrapped its 11-day stint on May 25 and where Pearce was supporting his new film \u201cThe Shrouds.\u201d Featured alongside stars like Sebastian Stan and\u00a0Bella Hadid, Pearce sported a black Yves Saint Laurent suit in his portrait, smiling straight at the camera. But social media sleuths detected an issue. A small Palestinian flag pin, which Pearce had been wearing on his lapel throughout Cannes, was missing from the photograph, though a different photo, featuring the pin, was posted to the magazine\u2019s Instagram the same day the article published.

{"id": "2024_05_28_europe_georgia-overrides-president-veto-intl", "text": "Georgia\u2019s parliament has voted to override the presidential veto of a Russian-inspired \u201cforeign agent\u201d law, defying fierce protests at home and criticism abroad. Tuesday\u2019s vote to bypass the objection of Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, whose powers are mostly ceremonial, was widely expected and clears the way for the parliament\u2019s speaker to sign the bill into law. The ruling Georgian Dream party has for weeks tried to force through the \u201cforeign agent\u201d law, likened by critics to a measure introduced in Russia to stifle dissent. The Georgian law, which has passed each of its three rounds of voting in parliament, would require organizations in the former Soviet country that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cforeign agents\u201d or face crippling fines. Georgian Dream argues the law is necessary to promote transparency and resist \u201cpseudo-liberal values\u201d fomented by foreigners, but its critics have said it could derail the country\u2019s bid to join the European Union and tip it into the Kremlin\u2019s orbit. \u201cThe European Union deeply regrets that the Georgian Parliament decided to override the President\u2019s veto,\u201d the bloc said Tuesday in a statement, saying the law \u201cgoes against EU core principles and values.\u201d The United States last week sanctioned Georgia, implementing a new visa restriction policy in response to the repressive law and crackdowns on protests. \u201cAs a longtime supporter of Georgia and it\u2019s Euro-Atlantic integration, I\u2019m deeply concerned and disappointed by the passage of the foreign agents bill and the rapid political shift taking place in the country, which is at odds with the wishes of the Georgian people,\u201d US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, said in a statement introducing the legislation. Responding to Tuesday\u2019s vote, Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said it marked \u201ca very sad day\u201d for Georgia and the rest of Europe. \u201cThe passing of this law effectively puts Georgia\u2019s accession to the EU on hold, with no benefit for anybody,\u201d he said. Natalie Sabanadze, Georgia\u2019s former ambassador to the EU, described the government\u2019s attempt to pass the law \u2013 just months before scheduled parliamentary elections \u2013 as a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat.\u201d \u201cThe Georgian government is clearly siding with the Putinist, anti-liberal forces of the world\u201d Sabanadze told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s turning into an instrument in the hands of Russia. I cannot speculate. I have no idea whether they\u2019re working on Russia\u2019s instructions, but they certainly are fulfilling their interests.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s vote nearly completes a process Georgia\u2019s government began 14 months ago. Georgian Dream tried to pass the same law last year, but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water canons. In a move widely seen as an effort to reward Georgia\u2019s citizens \u2013 of whom about 80% support joining the bloc \u2013 the EU granted it candidate status in December. But the government reintroduced the same bill in March and this time refused to cave to public pressure, despite a month of renewed protests.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/europe/georgia-overrides-president-veto-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Public Safety Power Shutoff program is in response to last year\u2019s fire that\u00a0killed more than 100 people in Lahaina\u00a0on the island of Maui and left $6 billion in damages. \u201cThis means they may turn off power in high-risk wildfire areas during extreme weather conditions,\u201d the Hawaii Division of Consumer advocacy said in a\u00a0public notice\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cWhile this may create hardships for affected customers, PSPS aims to prevent wildfires caused by downed power lines.\u201d The new program goes into effect July 1. Hawaiian Electric says\u00a0on its website\u00a0that \u201ca best-case scenario\u201d would allow them to give people 24-48 hours\u2019 notice before a shutdown.\u00a0According to the public notice,\u00a0residents would be notified of a potential shutoff through news releases, social media, outage maps or the Hawaiian Electric website. If weather changes suddenly, then a shutoff may occur with little or no notice. High wind and red flag warnings were issued by the National Weather Service on August 8, the day of the devastating Maui wildfires. But during the disaster,\u00a0the community\u2019s siren warning system did not sound. Investigations\u00a0by the state and the Western Fire Chiefs Association said the disaster was exacerbated by lack of preparation and coordination. Maui County\u2019s top emergency management official\u00a0resigned\u00a0days after defending the siren\u2019s silence, citing health reasons. Maui\u2019s government filed a lawsuit in August accusing Hawaiian Electric of causing the wildfires. The lawsuit alleged the electric company\u00a0\u201cinexcusably kept their power lines energized,\u201d despite the National Weather Service\u2019s warning that winds could knock down power lines and cause fires. The utility announced Wednesday it designated\u00a0high-risk areas\u00a0in three of the state\u2019s counties \u2013 including parts of the west coast of Oahu, its most populous island \u2013 where emergency power shutoffs are authorized in a weather emergency.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

{"id": "2024_05_31_asia_shangrila-dialogue-philippines-china-intl-hnk", "text": "The death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war, Philippines President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. warned Friday as his nation faces increasingly fraught clashes with Chinese vessels in the South China Sea. Marcos delivered the keynote speech of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, a regional gathering of global security leaders, including US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm. Dong Jun. The Philippine president was asked by a member of the audience whether a \u201cred line\u201d would be crossed if Chinese Coast Guard ships, which have frequently deployed water cannons against Philippine vessels in recent months, ended up killing a Filipino sailor. \u201cIf a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act, that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd our treaty partners, I believe, also hold that same standard,\u201d he added. China has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and China Coast Guard ships, reinforced by maritime militia boats, have been involved in a series of fraught clashes over the last year that has seen Philippine ships damaged and Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. With confrontations increasingly souring the Beijing-Manila relationship, Marcos has sought out closer ties with the United States, with which the Philippines maintains a mutual defense treaty. As part of that relationship, the US has gained increased rights to use Philippine military bases and the two allies have expanded bilateral military exercises. US officials consistently say the mutual defense pact is \u201ciron-clad\u201d and Philippine naval, coast guard and civilian vessels are covered by it. That raises the prospect that should one of the many maritime clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the South China Sea turn deadly, it could pile pressure on Washington to support its ally \u2013 and even drag the US military into a conflict. \u201cWe already have suffered injury. But thank God we have not yet gotten to the point where any of our participants, civilian or otherwise have been killed,\u201d Marcos said, referring to increasingly fraught clashes with China\u2019s coast guard ships. \u201cBut once we get to that point (a fatality)\u2026 we would certainly have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it is going to be a red line,\u201d he said. Key global waterway China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea \u2013 one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways. But portions of it are also claimed by governments in Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan as well as the Philippines. In 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China\u2019s claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis. But Beijing has rejected the tribunal\u2019s ruling and continued its military buildup, with many features lying hundreds of miles away from China\u2019s mainland. It also maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels \u2013 which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors. Marcos addressed the dispute multiple times in his speech. \u201cIllegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,\u201d he said, adding that the Philippines would defend it\u2019s sovereignty to \u201cthe last square millimeter.\u201d \u201cThe life-giving waters of the West Philippine Sea flow in the blood of every Filipino. We cannot allow anyone to detach it from the totality of the maritime domain that renders our nation whole,\u201d he added. In the past week, Marcos has been raising concerns over a new Chinese policy that give its coast guard new powers of detention in Chinese-claimed areas of the South China Sea, including areas that lie within the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone. Meanwhile, the Philippine Navy said it is prepared to protect the rights of Filipinos and would be increasing patrols in the South China Sea, including the areas of contested sovereignty, according to the PNA. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said earlier this week that the new regulations are \u201cin line with common international practices.\u201d \u201cAs long as there is no illegal behavior by any individual or entity, there is no need to worry,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cWhat I want to emphasize is that it is not China but the Philippines that has frequently escalated the situation in the South China Sea,\u201d Ning added. In his speech Marcos also warned that growing rivalry between the United States and China was impacting the entire Asia-Pacific region. \u201cThe strategic competition between China and the United States is permeating the evolving regional landscape. This rivalry is constraining the strategic choices of regional states. This contest is exacerbating flashpoints, it has created new security dilemmas,\u201d Marcos told delegates. \u201cThe continued stability of this region requires China and the United States to manage that rivalry in a responsible manner,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/asia/shangrila-dialogue-philippines-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_asia_zelensky-shangri-la-dialogue-singapore-intl-hnk", "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy arrived in Singapore Saturday for a previously unannounced appearance at a summit of defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific as Ukraine\u2019s troops scramble to counter a major Russian advance into its northeast. Zelensky\u2019s surprise attendance at the gathering is a stark illustration of Kyiv\u2019s determination to keep the international community engaged in Ukraine\u2019s defense \u2013 and its vision for peace \u2013 more than two years into Russia\u2019s devastating invasion. The Ukrainian leader has traveled outside his embattled country sparingly during the war and earlier this month called off international engagements as his troops defended against the surprise Russian offensive in northeastern Kharkiv. A CNN team at the summit witnessed Zelensky and his delegation arriving. His attendance at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore provides a\u00a0rare opportunity for Zelensky to potentially meet with defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific, including China which has deepened its relations with Moscow since the war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and defense heads from US allies Australia, Japan, and South Korea, as well as China\u2019s Defense Minster Dong Jun are expected to be in attendance for the three-day gathering. Announcing his arrival at the summit, Zelensky said in a statement on X that he would hold \u201ca number of meetings,\u201d in particular with Austin, Singapore\u2019s president and prime minister, Timor-Leste\u2019s president and Singaporean investors. The pentagon confirmed on Saturday that Austin would meet Zelensky and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Shangri-La on Sunday, \u201cto discuss the current battlefield situation in Ukraine and to underscore US commitment to ensuring Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against ongoing Russian aggression.\u201d Zelensky arrives in Singapore weeks ahead of a Ukraine-backed peace summit slated to be held in Switzerland amid a mounting urgency for Kyiv to bolster international support for its peace plan \u2013 especially in the face of the looming US presidential elections, which could see a shift in the level of US support for his cause. Ukraine relies squarely on international funds and weapons \u2013 and faces shortages of manpower and equipment. Months of political wrangling on Capitol Hill as well as lack of supplies from NATO countries have kept Ukraine\u2019s forces significantly outgunned against Russia. A major $61 billion aid injection for Ukraine bill was finally passed by the US in late April. On Friday, Zelenksy was in Sweden for a summit with Northern European leaders where he said Ukraine\u2019s \u201ctop priorities\u201d were to ensure more air defense systems and weapons for Ukraine, as well as \u201cglobal efforts to force Russia to make peace,\u201d according to the leader\u2019s post on the platform X. In Asia, Zelensky may carry a similar message. The conflict, though a continent away, has been watched closely by governments across the region, especially those contending with territorial disputes with another military and authoritarian power in the region, China. The conflict in Europe is also widely seen to have impacted the security climate in Asia. Russia has nurtured a burgeoning relationship with North Korea, believed by Western governments to have supplied Russian forces with munitions in recent months. Moscow and Beijing have also deepened their strategic partnership during Russia\u2019s war, with the US accusing China of bolstering Russia\u2019s defense industrial base with dual-use exports \u2013 and divisions between China and the West deepening over Beijing\u2019s close Kremlin ties. Those exports were raised during a meeting Friday between Austin and his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun. Austin indicated to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily, a senior US defense official said after the meeting. Dong said China, which claims neutrality in the conflict, had honored its \u201cpromise not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict\u201d and has strict controls on dual-use exports, according to China\u2019s spokesperson. Beijing also confirmed Friday that it would not send a delegation to the upcoming, Ukraine-backed peace conference in Switzerland, with its Foreign Ministry citing\u00a0its view that\u00a0any international peace conference should have \u201crecognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.\u201d Zelensky\u2019s 10-point peace plan calls for Russia to withdraw all its troops from Ukrainian territory and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognized borders. Zelensky has previously made surprise appearances at global summits to keep attention focused on Ukraine\u2019s plight and strengthen ties \u2013 he famously dropped in on the Group of 7 (G7) summit last year in Japan. It\u2019s not clear if he will have an opportunity to meet with any Chinese officials during his time in Singapore. Russia is not participating in the gathering. In an interview with Russia\u2019s state news agency RIA Novosti, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested Thursday that China could organize a peace conference involving both Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky\u2019s arrival also comes as US President Joe Biden broke from long-standing policy to give Ukraine permission to use American munitions for limited strikes within Russian territory close to the border with Kharkiv, CNN reported Thursday, citing US officials. Key European leaders have also signaled a similar position shift. However, the US elections have raised uncertainty over the level of US support for Ukraine\u2019s war effort if the fighting continues into next year \u2013\u2013 widely seen as adding another measure of urgency to Ukraine\u2019s push for peace on its terms. Biden, a staunch supporter of Kyiv, competes for office against former President Donald Trump, who in the past refused to say whether he wants Russia or Ukraine to win the war and raised questions about his commitment to America\u2019s NATO allies. CNN\u2019s Ivan Watson, Xiaofei Xu, Alex Stambaugh, Natasha Bertrand and Sharon Braithwaite contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/asia/zelensky-shangri-la-dialogue-singapore-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_middleeast_what-seven-months-of-war-mean-for-israel-hamas-mime-intl", "text": "Israel has warned that its war in Gaza could extend until the end of the year. National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi stated on Wednesday that the country anticipates \u201cseven more months of fighting\u201d to achieve its objective of destroying Hamas, a goal that remains unmet after more than seven months of conflict. Prolonging the war could have catastrophic consequences for Palestinians in the already ravaged territory and significant repercussions for Israel and beyond, experts said. It could further harm Israel\u2019s economy, influence its domestic politics, and damage its international standing and foreign relations.\u00a0It could also impact US politics, particularly as President Joe Biden gears up for the November elections. \u201cIt\u2019s a grueling grind forward,\u201d said Assaf Orion, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv and former head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strategic planning division. \u201cWe see the day-in, day-out toll of that kind of fighting\u2026 On top of that, there is of course the political, diplomatic, informational and reputational issues, in which Israel is paying growing costs for the ongoing fight.\u201d Here\u2019s what seven more months of war could mean. More suffering for Palestinians The situation is deteriorating by the day inside Gaza and a continuation of the war is likely to significantly increase the suffering of the people there. In February, when the death toll in the territory stood at 28,000, researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health projected that if the war escalated the total number of deaths would surpass 72,000 by August. If the impact of epidemics sparked by the conflict is included, the toll could be close to 86,000 by then. Aid agencies have warned that civilians in Gaza are suffering from famine in parts of the enclave and that more airstrikes and more displacement in the south of the strip are only compounding the humanitarian crisis. Delivering much-needed aid into the territory is incredibly difficult. The amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza dropped by 67% after Israel launched its military offensive in Rafah earlier in May, the United Nations warned this week. \u201cWe once again call for a ceasefire and the release of all hostages,\u201d said Juliette Touma, director of communications at the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). \u201cThe longer this war goes on the more there is suffering for Israeli and Palestinian civilians.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s fate Experts suggest that both Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu see benefits in prolonging the war, as their political survival depends on it. A post-war scenario is unlikely to feature either party: Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas, and Netanyahu may face accountability for failing to prevent the October 7 attacks that triggered the conflict. Additionally, new elections in Israel could potentially unseat the longtime prime minister. \u201cMost Israelis support early elections, the largest proportion of which want elections as soon as the war is over,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. \u201cSo, in this sense, an extended war might delay elections and therefore postpone Netanyahu\u2019s day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d A majority of Jewish Israelis would be willing to bear the burden of continued fighting for at least six months, Plesner told CNN, citing data from\u00a0a survey conducted between March 31 and April 3. \u201cSo, Israelis are ready for sustained fighting \u2013\u202fthe question is who they want leading them.\u201d A significant majority of Israelis believe that the time has come for those responsible for the failures of October 7 and the war to step down, he added. The Israeli leader has so far refused to take responsibility for the war, stating that such questions will be addressed only after the military achieves its goals: the release of hostages and the elimination of Hamas. Israel has lost 292 soldiers in Gaza since it began its ground offensive there, which came in retaliation to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others, according to Israeli officials. \u00a0More than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the health ministry in the territory. Netanyahu also faces intense pressure from hardline members of his fragile coalition to continue the war. Some have threatened to quit the government if he accepts a ceasefire deal before Hamas is eliminated. Israeli diplomacy Israel\u2019s diplomatic isolation could grow if the war drags on. The government has become the target of increased censure on the world stage, drawing sharp criticism from some of its closest allies in Europe for its conduct. It has withdrawn envoys from three European nations, in response to them formally recognizing a Palestinian state, and had several South American and other countries downgrade diplomatic relations. Legal action could also escalate. Netanyahu is facing a potential arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court over some of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, and Israel is facing a genocide case at the International Court of Justice. That court has ordered Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah, a legally binding order that Israel has so far ignored. An extended war may also further delay prospects of normalization with Saudi Arabia, something Netanyahu singled out as a priority for his government before the October 7 attack. This conflict has derailed those efforts and the Jewish state has come under harsh criticism from Riyadh, as well as other Arab states that already have diplomatic ties with Israel, including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Egypt, the first Arab nation to recognize Israel, has warned its neighbor against stationing troops so close to its border. At least one member of Egyptian security personnel was killed during a shooting incident on the Egypt-Gaza border this week. \u201cIt is a deep conundrum,\u201d Orion of INSS said. For Israel, it is difficult to balance between the need to make sure Hamas will never again be able to launch another attack, with the duty to release the remaining hostages and other costs Israel is paying, he said. \u201cAnd currently Hamas doesn\u2019t seem to be ready to release them.\u201d Impact on Israel\u2019s economy The war hit Israel\u2019s economy hard in the immediate aftermath of October 7. In the fourth quarter of 2023, economic output plunged 21.7% compared to the year earlier, falling for the first time in nearly two years before rebounding in the next quarter. Despite the recovery, credit rating agency S&P Global said it expects the Israeli economy to recover slower than in previous downturns. In April, the agency downgraded Israel\u2019s credit rating, a measurement of the government\u2019s ability to repay its debts, and warned about further downgrades in the future. It expected the government\u2019s budget deficit to widen, \u201cmostly as a result of increased defense spending.\u201d Moody\u2019s Investors Service, another rating agency, also downgraded Israel, warning that the war will become a significant economic and political burden for the country over the long haul. It expects Israel\u2019s defense spending to be nearly double the level of 2022 by the end of 2024, and potentially rise even higher in coming years. Troops, ammunition, funding and the supply of arms are ultimately not endless, especially for a small country, Orion said. While the war in Gaza has been fought at varying intensity since October 7, it is nonetheless \u201cexacting a very high cost on Israel.\u201d Since its founding in 1948, Israel has fought numerous wars, but this one is its costliest. As of January, the Israeli military was spending $272 million per day on the war, according to the Israeli news site Ynet. By that time, the total cost had reached an estimated $60 billion, factoring in military expenses, damage to civilian infrastructure and compensation to Israeli businesses. This figure has likely increased significantly since then. Israel\u2019s decision-makers have taken notice. When the military initiated a partial withdrawal from Gaza in January, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari cited economic concerns as one of the reasons, stating that it would \u201csignificantly ease the burden.\u201d Plesner said the government hasn\u2019t taken the necessary steps to mitigate economic damage. While Israel\u2019s economy has bounced back from previous conflicts and crises, he said, a prolonged war may make a recovery more challenging. \u201cThere are not sufficient funds available to cover the costs associated with the war on both the military and civilian related costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer the war goes on, the deeper its economic impact.\u201d Biden\u2019s prospects for re-election The war is having deep consequences for US domestic politics and is weighing heavily on Biden\u2019s re-election bid. The president has been facing a severe backlash at home from progressive, young and Arab American voters that could put his re-election hopes in several key swing states in jeopardy. Biden has consistently supported Israel, offering it almost unconditional diplomatic and legal protection on the global stage. However, his administration has also taken unprecedented punitive measures against the Jewish state, including sanctions on West Bank settlers and withholding American arms that could be used against civilians in Rafah. Despite these efforts, the war persists, civilian casualties rise and famine spreads in Gaza, intensifying pressure from some of his electorate. A CNN poll last month found that Biden\u2019s handling of the war yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and majority disapproval among Democrats (53%). In a speech at the White House on Friday, Biden laid out a three-phase proposal\u00a0Israel has submitted\u00a0to wind down the grinding crisis as he\u00a0declared, \u201cIt\u2019s time\u00a0for this war to end.\u201d It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza\u00a0have\u00a0been met, and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting as part of a hostage deal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/middleeast/what-seven-months-of-war-mean-for-israel-hamas-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_europe_russian-strike-kharkiv-megastore-intl", "text": "Eighteen people, including a 12-year-old girl, are among those killed in a Russian strike that hit a large store in Kharkiv\u00a0at the weekend, regional officials have said, making it the deadliest attack Ukraine has endured in several weeks. Five people remain missing, Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said Monday. He said that 48 people were injured in the strike that hit the Epicenter hypermarket shopping center building while nearly 200 people were inside. Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second biggest city, which sits near its border with Russia, has seen a spate of Russian attacks in recent weeks. Security camera footage of the moment of the strike shows the building shake on impact, with the whole site immediately engulfed in thick smoke and flames. Police and witnesses described at least two explosions taking place. Oleksandr Lutsenko, director of the Epicenter shopping center, said he was in his office on the second floor at the time of the two explosions. \u201cI started to make my way down the corridor to the evacuation exit, but it was dark and the whole corridor was covered in dust. There was no air to breathe,\u201d he told CNN over the telephone. \u201cThe employees were also leaving. Everyone was groping, and people were holding each other. We could hear the ceiling falling.\u201d Once outside, he saw the hypermarket was on fire. \u201cThere was black smoke everywhere, and it was hard to breathe. Some people were jumping out of the windows,\u201d Lutsenko added. Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, Ihor\u00a0Klymenko, said the hours following the strike were \u201chellish\u201d and thanked everyone who helped to put\u00a0out the fires. Photographs from inside the store following the attack show the building in complete ruin, with burnt stock and collapsed walls. Ukrainian Catholic University identified the killed 12-year-old as Maria Myronenko, saying in a Facebook post that she had died in the strike alongside her mother, Iryna, who was a student at the institute. Her father had also been injured and was being treated in hospital, it said. Serhii Bolvinov, Chief of the Investigative Department of the Kharkiv Regional Police, said the family had been shopping when the two bombs hit. Maria\u2019s elder sister, Nadiya, 20, was not with them at the time, and learned of the deaths only after finding her father in hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the strike as a \u201cbrutal attack,\u201d saying that\u00a0\u201cRussia is run by men who want to make it a norm \u2013 burning lives, destroying cities and villages, dividing people, and erasing national borders through war.\u201d Zelensky, who was in Spain for an official visit on Monday, urged Ukraine\u2019s allies to provide it with more air defenses. Meeting with Zelensky in Madrid, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced on Monday a new $1.08 billion weapons deal for Ukraine that \u201caims to reinforce air defense systems\u201d and protect Ukrainian citizens and infrastructure from Russia\u2019s attacks. \u201cWe are sending Patriot missiles,\u201d Sanchez said of the American-built air-defense system. \u201cZelensky\u00a0asks for the platforms to launch those, asking how many we can give. We are sending another batch of Leopard tanks and above all, munitions that the [Ukrainian] troops need.\u201d Zelensky\u00a0was due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed the trip due to Russia\u2019s offensive around Kharkiv and other parts of Ukraine. That offensive appears to continue, with Kharkiv enduring intense attacks daily. The United States announced on Friday that it\u2019s sending $275 million in military assistance to Ukraine as part of \u201cefforts to help Ukraine repel Russia\u2019s assault near Kharkiv,\u201d according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The top US diplomat said the new tranche of assistance \u201ccontains urgently needed capabilities\u201d for Ukrainian troops as they\u00a0fight to hold back Russia\u2019s advances\u00a0toward the key northeastern city. Ukraine tamps down French trainer comments News of the new military assistance came as Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry tamped down expectations that French military trainers could soon be in Ukraine after online comments from army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi appeared to suggest their arrival in country was a done deal. \u201cI welcome the initiative of France to send instructors to Ukraine to train Ukrainian military personnel,\u201d Syrskyi had written on Telegram following a video conference between himself and the two countries\u2019 defense ministers. \u201cI have already signed the documents that will allow the first French instructors to visit our training centres and get acquainted with the infrastructure and personnel.\u201d Syrskyi\u2019s statement gave no possible timeline, but seemed to indicate France was ready to make what would be a very significant shift in NATO countries\u2019 involvement in Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. Further heightening that sense, Syrskyi went on to write, \u201cI believe that France\u2019s determination will encourage other partners to join this ambitious project. I thanked the minister for the friendly support of the French people and military and economic assistance to Ukraine to repel Russian military aggression.\u201d In a later comment to CNN, apparently designed to lower expectations, and possibly soothe key allies, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry toned down the language, saying Kyiv had \u201cexpressed interest in the prospect of welcoming foreign instructors in Ukraine\u201d ever since a conference in Paris at the end of February. \u201cWe have ongoing discussions with France and other countries on this issue and have started internal paperwork to move forward when the decision is taken,\u201d the short statement concluded. The French Defense Ministry, in a comment to CNN, had a similar message about military trainers. \u201cAs with all the projects discussed at the conference, we are continuing to work with the Ukrainians to understand their exact needs,\u201d the statement said. At the Paris conference, French President Emmanuel Macron had floated the idea that sending military trainers to Ukraine was one way Kyiv\u2019s western allies could deploy troops in the country.

{"id": "2024_05_29_weather_texas-dallas-houston-storm-power-outages", "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Texans are without power and many could be in the dark for several days after fierce and deadly storms tore through the state Tuesday and over the holiday weekend, leaving people to pick up the pieces of devastated homes and businesses amid uncomfortably hot weather. More than 280,000 utility customers in Texas were without power as of Wednesday evening, including more than 150,000 in Dallas County alone, according to PowerOutage.us. Both Houston and Dallas were slammed with hurricane-force winds Tuesday as violent storms flooded roads, upended trees and power lines and reduces some buildings to shells of their former selves. The winds collapsed an under-construction home in Magnolia, Texas, killing a 16-year-old working inside of it, according to the Montgomery County Sheriff\u2019s Office. At least eight people have been killed in the state since Saturday as severe weather pummeled the region over Memorial Day weekend. The violent weather is just the latest in an unrelenting series of severe storms that has battered Texas in recent weeks, leaving residents with little time to recover from one storm before the next arrives at their doorstep. Summerlike heat will ease across Texas this week following a sweltering heat wave, but those left without power or a reliable way to cool down could still face the risk of dangerous heat stroke or heat exhaustion. Temperatures across eastern Texas on Wednesday will hover around the mid-80s to low 90s, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins warned people to prepare to be without power for days as an area utility company reported extensive damage to its infrastructure. The utility, Oncor, shared photos of mangled electricity poles, twisted power lines and massive toppled trees. Widespread outages also hampered primary runoff elections on Tuesday in Dallas County, as more than a third of polling locations were in the dark, according to Jenkins. \u201cCheck on your friends, family, and neighbors, especially anyone elderly,\u201d Dallas County officials advised. \u201cDon\u2019t move debris yet as there could be hidden downed power lines that could still be energized.\u201d Esmeralda Martinez, who lives in the Dallas suburb of Carrollton, is among those now sifting through homes that were reduced to piles of soggy debris and jagged wooden beams, CNN affiliate WFAA reports. She and her family sheltered in a hallway as the storm tore off the roof, damaging every room in her home and soaking their belongings. Across the street, Javon Holloway and his grandmother are grateful their home was spared from more serious damage. The neighbors are thankful no one was harmed. \u201cDon\u2019t take your house for granted. I\u2019ll say that much. Be thankful for what you got,\u201d Holloway told WFAA. Storms continued moving across north and central Texas on Tuesday night and are expected to last through Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service in Fort Worth said. After a brief reprieve, another round of powerful storms will rumble back into the same area Thursday evening, bringing a threat of large hail, damaging winds and localized flooding to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Houston faces damage d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu Houston-area residents are facing an all-too-familar feeling as they survey the fresh layer of damage left by Tuesday\u2019s storms \u2013 just two weeks after a derecho and a tornado bulldozed through the city, killing multiple people and knocking out power for nearly 1 million homes and businesses. Though 99% of those outages had been restored as of last week, more than 300,000 homes and businesses in the Houston area lost power in Tuesday\u2019s storms, according to the regional utility CenterPoint Energy. A majority of its customers had power restored by Wednesday morning. The latest severe weather also thwarted some of the city\u2019s ongoing recovery after the mid-May storm covered streets with trees and debris, shattered skyscraper windows and damaged buildings. That damage had not yet been fully repaired when Tuesday\u2019s storms tore through, rescattering piles of debris that crews had been collecting off the streets and sending another shower of broken window glass onto Downtown Houston, according to CNN affiliates KTRK and KHOU.

{"id": "2024_05_31_middleeast_idf-central-rafah-intl", "text": "The Israeli military is in central Rafah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed in a statement Friday, despite international concern and anger over its military operation in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city. The IDF statement confirms what eyewitnesses told CNN earlier this week, when tanks were spotted in central Rafah for the first time since it entered the city earlier this month. \u201cIDF\u00a0troops in central Rafah located Hamas rocket launchers, terror tunnel shafts, and weapons. The troops also dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility in the area,\u201d the\u00a0IDF\u00a0said in the statement. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had established \u201coperational control\u201d over the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Palestinian side of the Egypt-Gaza border. Access to cell phone services in Rafah was interrupted on Thursday due to the ongoing Israeli offensive,\u00a0Palestinian telecommunications company Jawwal said in a\u00a0statement. Israel\u2019s incursion into Rafah earlier in May marked a new phase in its war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in the enclave, displaced the majority of the strip\u2019s population and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe that has appalled international agencies. Over the weekend, Israel launched an airstrike on a displacement camp in the city, killing dozens and creating global outrage. The strike also took out two Hamas leaders, Israel said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cThe word tragic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it,\u201d US Vice President Kamala Harris said of the incident on Tuesday. But neither she or President Joe Biden have said the strike crossed a red line for US support. Biden had said in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. The confirmation of the IDF\u2019s presence in central Rafah came as it said it had ended operations in eastern\u00a0Jabalya,\u00a0in the north of the Gaza Strip. The military said in a statement that its troops had destroyed more than 10 kilometres (six miles) of tunnels and weapons production sites in the Jabalya operation, which began earlier this month and involved what the IDF described as \u201cintense combat and close-quarters encounters\u201d with combatants. The statement also said the bodies of seven hostages were recovered during the operation. The hostages were killed on October 7, it said, and their remains were then taken to Gaza. But Mahmoud Basal, a civil defense spokesperson in Gaza, told CNN on Friday that\u00a0Jabalya\u00a0was a \u201cdisaster area\u201d following Israel\u2019s presence, with \u201centire residential squares\u201d decimated. \u201cJabalya\u00a0camp is not suitable for life, unfortunately,\u201d Basal said. \u201cThere are no water wells, schools, or hospitals, all of which have been completely destroyed. There is nothing that would enable the life of the citizen in this area, and there are a large number of martyrs and houses that have been leveled to the ground with citizens inside them, and we cannot recover the bodies from under the rubble.\u201d Israel resumed fighting in northern Gaza earlier this month, despite having said it had dismantled Hamas\u2019 command structure in the area back in January. The renewed fighting show the challenges Israel faces in achieving its goal of destroying Hamas, with a top security official this month warning the war could last into next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/middleeast/idf-central-rafah-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, Kimo Tynes, the director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a statement. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served, so his prison sentence is complete, the release said. The 31-year-old American faced as much as a 12-year prison sentence. But the Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case and said, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich returned to Virginia on Thursday, arriving at the Richmond International Airport, CNN affiliate WWBT reported. Another American charged with possession of ammunition, Ryan Tyler Watson, pleaded guilty Tuesday, according to Tynes. Watson\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for June 21. Watson and Wenrich are among five Americans arrested in Turks and Caicos in recent months, all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. Bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from its government. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d  Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. Meanwhile, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. On Friday, American Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty and received a 52-week sentence\u00a0suspended for one year\u00a0and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. He returned to the United States after paying the fine. In addition to Hagerich and Wenrich, one other American \u2013 Michael Lee Evans \u2013 pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, attorney Oliver Smith told CNN. The rest remain in Turks and Caicos. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, with the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences, Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date.
