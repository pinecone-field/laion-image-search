{"id": "2024_07_04_asia_modi-putin-russia-india-visit-intl", "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Moscow next week for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, a sign of the growing relationship between the two countries even as New Delhi maintains strong ties with the United States. Modi will be in Moscow on July 8 and 9 at the invitation of President Vladimir Putin, India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs announced, adding they would \u201cexchange views on contemporary regional and global issues of mutual interest.\u201d Modi\u2019s plans for the trip were first reported last month by Russian state media, citing Kremlin officials. India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment \u2013 a vital link given India\u2019s ongoing tensions at its shared Himalayan border with China \u2013 and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Modi\u2019s visit is widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. India\u2019s ties with Russia date back decades to the Cold War and have remained strong despite repeated sanctions on Moscow from Western governments. New Delhi has repeatedly abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations Security Council and has avoided public criticism of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. Confirmation of Modi\u2019s visit comes as Russia draws ever closer to China, potentially making New Delhi uncomfortable due to its longstanding Himalayan border dispute with Beijing that has simmered in recent years. On Wednesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Putin hailed their two countries\u2019 deepening alignment at a regional security summit in Kazakhstan, with the Russian leader claiming relations between the two were going through \u201cthe best period in their history\u201d and should be considered a \u201cstabilizing\u201d force for the world. Modi, however, was notably absent from the annual leaders\u2019 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a bloc of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia that is seen as a counterweight to Western institutions led by the US and its allies. Some analysts viewed Modi\u2019s decision to skip the event as a sign the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy does not view the bloc as an effective channel through which New Delhi can pursue its interests. Modi last met Putin on the sidelines of the 2022 SCO summit, where he told the Russian leader that today\u2019s era is \u201cnot of war.\u201d Yet his upcoming visit to Moscow is being viewed positively by the Kremlin \u2013 which has described Modi\u2019s relationship with Putin as \u201cvery trusting\u201d in nature \u2013 and comes as Russia aims to push back against Western efforts to isolate it on the world stage as punishment for its war in Ukraine. \u201cWe can expect that there will be an exchange of views on all issues that are on the agenda, and there are many of them,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russia\u2019s state-run news agency TASS on Tuesday. Last month Putin also met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang, where the two autocrats vowed to strengthen ties and deepen their cooperation in a new partnership that was signed during the visit. Moscow this year has taken up the position as chair of the BRICS economic bloc, which includes Brazil, India, China and South Africa, providing Putin with an opportunity to push back against growing Western isolation and portray himself as a key player on a broad diplomatic stage. But Modi\u2019s visit is set against the backdrop of India\u2019s growing relations with the US, as both countries share concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington in June last year, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. India is a member of the Quad security grouping with the US, Japan and Australia. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_07_05_sport_spain-germany-quarterfinal-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Euro 2024 host Germany was dumped out of the tournament on Friday after a 2-1 quarterfinal defeat by Spain in Stuttgart. Dani Olmo, who plays for Bundesliga club\u00a0RB Leipzig, opened the scoring early in the second half, finishing off a slick attacking move and converting an assist from 16-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal. With Germany seemingly out of time, Florian Wirtz\u2019s slick finish in the 89th minute kept the tournament host\u2019s hopes alive. However, in extra-time Spain conjured up their own late goal on 119 minutes, Mikel Merino heading home the winner to send the three-time Euros winner to the semifinals. It marks the second successive European Championships in which Spain has reached the semifinals stage while Germany\u2019s run at its home tournament is over. Tournament winners in 1964, 2008 and 2012, Spain will play France in the semifinals, after Les Bleus beat Portugal on penalties later on Friday in Hamburg. Spain suffered a blow in the opening 10 minutes when its 21-year-old midfield star Pedri was forced off having sustained an injury after he was fouled by German counterpart Toni Kroos. Pedri was replaced by Olmo, who plays for Bundesliga club RB Leipzig. The opening 20 minutes in Stuttgart were played in extremely open fashion, with Germany\u2019s Kai Havertz in the thick of the action early on. The Arsenal forward had a goalscoring chance when he controlled a long pass on his chest before he hit a right-footed shot straight at Unai Sim\u00f3n. Olmo was the next to test one of the two goalkeepers when his long-range effort stung the palms of Manuel Neuer. After the halftime break and a series of substitutions for both sides, Spain\u2019s captain Alvaro Morata had a golden opportunity to open the scoring following some clever hold-up play deep inside the German box but he blazed over the bar. Spain was eventually rewarded for its bright start to the second half when 16-year-old Yamal\u2019s beautifully weighted pass was swept into the bottom corner by Olmo in the 52nd minute to give Luis de la Fuente\u2019s side the lead and stun the host nation. Germany turned up the attacking emphasis after going behind, with Niclas F\u00fcllkrug, who has scored twice off the bench this tournament, coming on just minutes later. Second-half substitute Robert Andrich \u2013 sporting a new pink haircut \u2013 tested Sim\u00f3n with a long-range shot while F\u00fcllkrug hit the post with just over 10 minutes remaining. With F\u00fcllkrug and Havertz leading the line for Germany, Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s side began throwing an increasing number of crosses into the Spain box, but La Roja\u2019s center-back pairing of Aymeric Laporte and Nacho held firm. Nagelsmann then introduced another attacker \u2013 Thomas M\u00fcller \u2013 to ramp up the pressure on Spain. That German pressure almost told, when Sim\u00f3n\u2019s poor kick resulted in Havertz being played through one-on-one with the Spanish goalkeeper, but his dainty chip landed agonizingly over the bar. Then Germany found its equalizer when a deep cross from Maximilian Mittelst\u00e4dt was headed back by Joshua Kimmich and Wirtz pounced to smash home. The first 15 minutes of extra-time were cagey. Mikel Oyarzabal\u2019s shot went close, while an effort from Wirtz flew past the post. Penalties looked to be looming but, with 118 minutes played, Olmo swung in a dangerous cross and Merino was there to head Spain into the semifinals and spark jubilant scenes of celebration among La Roja\u2019s fans. There were still some heart-in-mouth moments for Spain, in particular when F\u00fcllkrug\u2019s header whizzed past the post. Germany continued to push and although Spanish right-back Dani Carvajal was sent off in the dying moments, Spain held on for a famous victory to see it into the final four of Euro 2024.

{"id": "2024_07_05_weather_west-coast-california-oregon-heat-wave", "text": "An extremely dangerous, unusually long heat wave is intensifying and spreading up the West Coast \u2013 and there will be no relief for days. California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Arizona are bracing for potential wildfires, opening cooling centers and warning residents to stay indoors and keep hydrated as the unrelenting heat wave delivers sweltering temperatures well into the 100s and 110s \u2013 with highs in the 120s possible in the Desert Southwest. And it\u2019s only getting hotter. Death Valley, California, could top 125 degrees by Sunday or Monday, setting a new daily record for those dates. Las Vegas, Nevada, could also exceed its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees Sunday or Monday. \u201cConfidence is increasing that this potentially historic heatwave will last several days,\u201d the National Weather Service in Portland warned, adding that the risk of heat-related illness will increase significantly. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service. In\u00a0San\u00a0Jose, California, a homeless man\u00a0died Tuesday due to the extreme heat, Mayor Matt Mahan said.\u00a0The man was 69, according to the mayor\u2019s spokesperson, Tasha Dean, citing information from the\u00a0Santa Clara Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. The same day, a 10-year-old died in Arizona after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, the Phoenix Police Department said. \u201cThis is a DANGEROUS situation, especially for sensitive populations,\u201d the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said, reminding residents to drink plenty of water, stay in the shade, wear light, loose fitting clothes and never leave anyone in a car, Saturday will likely be the hottest day in this prolonged heat wave. High temperatures in the 110s are becoming common across California, outside coastal areas and higher elevations, the National Weather Service said. \u201cThis level of heat throughout parts of the Mojave Desert and Sacramento/San Joaquin valleys of California could pose a risk to anyone if proper heat safety is not followed,\u201d the weather service said. Nationwide, nearly 140 million people remain under heat alerts \u2013 mostly in Western states, where the heat wave is expected to last through the middle of next week. Parts of Oregon will experience triple digits Friday, and the heat could last up to five days with poor overnight relief, the National Weather Service in Portland said. A state of emergency was declared in Multnomah County, Oregon\u2019s most populous county, for this weekend\u00a0as temperatures were expected to climb. \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend,\u201d Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno said in a news release. \u201cThey\u2019ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.\u201d Bruno said the area has had few hot days so far this year, and residents\u2019 bodies have not yet acclimated to the heat. A previous heat wave that scorched Oregon in 2021 left dozens of people dead. Power equipment buckled in the heat, triggering rolling blackouts for tens of thousands as temperatures soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. While this heat wave isn\u2019t expected to be as intense as the 2021 scorcher,\u00a0forecasters are concerned about its long duration, said Meteorologist Noah Alviz of the National Weather Service in Portland.\u00a0\u201cGetting into the upper 90s or even triple digits of 100 to 105 for four to five days \u2013 that is very unusual for this location,\u201d Alviz told CNN. \u201cThe triple-digit heat will expand northward into the Pacific Northwest and parts of the central Great Basin, with widespread highs rising into the 90s and low 100s,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cThe duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week.\u201d Over a dozen high-temperature records were either broken or tied on Thursday, including multiple California cities. Palmdale reached 110 degrees, and Madera hit 109 degrees. The stage is set for wildfire spread The extreme heat \u2013 combined with gusty winds and low humidity \u2013 means any wildfires that start will spread quickly through already parched vegetation. Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the area of the Thompson Fire, which has consumed more than 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday. The blaze, which was 46% contained by mid-morning Friday local time, has forced thousands of people to evacuate and prompted more than 2,000 firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat in the Oroville area. The wildfire has injured 11 firefighters, including eight who were affected by heat-related illnesses, according to Chris Peterson, a spokesperson for the\u00a0California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection \u2013 also known as Cal Fire. Twenty-six structures have been destroyed by the blaze and more than 4,000 are under threat. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with more than 145,000 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 7,812 acres burned by this time last year, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. There are now nearly two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing fires on the coast in San Diego, to the foothills in Butte,\u201d Cal Fire Deputy Director Nick Schuler told CNN Wednesday. \u201cOur\u00a0firefighters are battling fires across California and often times on the line for more than 24 hours. It\u2019s difficult conditions that they face.\u201d A wildfire in California\u2019s Mariposa County, the French Fire, triggered evacuation orders Thursday night. The fire has burned more than 800 acres just northwest of the small community of Mariposa, outside Yosemite National Park, and is 15% contained as of Friday afternoon. California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0for the area of the Thompson Fire on Wednesday. The declaration cleared the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. And in central Washington state, fireworks sparked an active wildfire called the Balsam Root Fire early Friday morning, according to Wenatchee Valley Fire Department Chief Brian Brett. The fire is burning in Wenatchee, about 150 miles east of Seattle. The fire is currently around 250 acres and is 30% contained, Brett told CNN. A Level 3 Evacuation Alert is in effect for approximately 150 homes. Residents under this advisory are being told to leave immediately. The department had previously reminded residents that \u201cprivate fireworks are banned in most of Chelan and Douglas Counties.\u201d Fireworks started an estimated 31,302 fires in 2022, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Southeast to see sizzling temperatures, too As the West swelters, oppressive heat and humidity will begin to shift eastward to the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast for the end of the week. \u201cWarm overnight conditions in the upper 70s and low 80s will offer little relief, leading to a dangerous situation for those without access to adequate cooling,\u201d the National Weather Service said. New heat alerts are now posted in southeast Texas, extreme southern Florida and parts of the Southeast northward to the mid-Atlantic, where high temperatures will range between 95-105 degrees. Cities including Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Raleigh and Washington, DC, will be feeling the heat. The heat index values \u2013 how air feels to the human body \u2013 will range between 100 and 115 degrees in those areas. \u201cA cold front entering the southern Plains is anticipated to offer cooler and below average temperatures to Oklahoma, much of northern/western Texas, and the Mid-South by Friday,\u201d the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/weather/west-coast-california-oregon-heat-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_sport_france-portugal-quarterfinal-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "France edged into the semifinals of Euro 2024 after beating Portugal 5-3 in a penalty shootout after the game finished 0-0 on Friday. Theo Hern\u00e1ndez scored the decisive penalty to seal the quarterfinal victory in Hamburg, after Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix had hit the post earlier in the shootout. The game had been billed as Cristiano Ronaldo vs. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 but it was a match of few chances, with both teams showcasing their excellent defensive records at the tournament rather than taking risks to find a goal. Mbapp\u00e9 was substituted at the end of the first period of extra-time. Meanwhile, Ronaldo scored Portugal\u2019s first penalty of the shootout, though he also missed a golden chance during normal time when he was set up by Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o. France will face Spain in the semifinals on Tuesday, July 9 in Munich. Hern\u00e1ndez had the first shot on target of note in the 20th minute, but his long-range effort was parried away by Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa, the star of his team\u2019s penalty shootout victory over Slovenia in the previous round. Mbapp\u00e9, who was once again playing in a mask for the broken nose he suffered earlier in the tournament, had his first real opening early in the second half after exchanging a quick one-two with N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, though the France captain\u2019s shot was straight into the waiting arms of Costa. The best opening of the match came on the hour mark when Bruno Fernandes was fed the ball after a run from midfield. Having collected the ball, Fernandes unleased a powerful shot at goal but a strong hand from France goalkeeper Mike Maignan denied the Manchester United star. France had its best chance of the game when Randal Kolo Muani exchanged passes with Jules Kound\u00e9 to free himself in the box and just when it looked like his shot might be heading into the net, Portugal defender R\u00faben Dias appeared out of nowhere for a crucial block. That chance appeared to spark Les Bleus into life and soon after Eduardo Camavinga\u2019s shot from close range somehow missed the target. The introduction of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 midway through the second half gave France a new attacking dimension, with the Paris Saint-Germain winger going close with a curling effort. Ronaldo had his first real chance to make an impact on the game in extra-time. After some excellent wing play from Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, the 39-year-old found the ball at his feet inside the French penalty area but he could only fire over the bar. A superb block from Dayot Upamecano then denied Rafael Le\u00e3o when the Portuguese wide-man had an opening. There was a big surprise at the end of the first period of extra-time when Mbapp\u00e9 handed his captain\u2019s armband to manager Didier Deschamps before going to sit on the bench with an icepack on his nose. Mbapp\u00e9 had suffered a blow to his head earlier in the game in blocking a shot and appeared to be in some discomfort afterwards. Mbapp\u00e9 has been wearing a protective mask ever since breaking his nose earlier in the tournament. He has previously said that it is \u201chorrible playing with a mask.\u201d In the 120th minute, Portugal had a brilliant opportunity to win the game but Nuno Mendes\u2019 effort with his weaker right foot was straight at Maignan and so the game went to penalties. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 opened up the shootout with a successful attempt before Ronaldo, who was at the center of much penalty drama in the win over Slovenia, comfortably swept his home. Deadlock in the shootout was broken when Felix, a late substitute in extra-time, hit the left upright with his attempt, leaving the door open from France. And the 2022 World Cup runner-up didn\u2019t pass up the opportunity, with Bradley Barcola and Hern\u00e1ndez both scoring past the despairing Costa \u2013 who had saved three Slovenian penalties in the last-16 round \u2013 to book its spot in the final four. While the French players celebrated, it was an emotional evening for Ronaldo who has in all probability made his final appearance at a European Championships.

{"id": "2022_07_03_travel_drowning-water-safety-tips-wellness", "text": "On Good Friday 2017, Wyatt Werneth got a call from his wife, who had gone grocery shopping with their daughter: The car\u2019s broken down. Please rescue us. Werneth hopped in his vehicle to assist, driving by Patrick Space Force Base near Cape Canaveral, Florida. From the A1A highway, Werneth said you can see the ocean. What he saw next was a twist of fate that led to a much more urgent kind of rescue. \u201cI could see someone waving in traffic as I was going by. \u2026 I pulled in to see what was going on; I had the immediate instinct that something was happening in the water,\u201d Werneth recalled to CNN Travel. \u201cWhen I came over the berm, I did not realize what I was getting into. There were multiple people in the water.\u201d And they were in trouble. Very serious trouble. Rip current kind of trouble. The scene would send chills of dread down anyone\u2019s spine \u2014 but at least Werneth was prepared. He is an experienced lifeguard instructor and had water rescue equipment with him.  But with at least five people struggling in a vicious Atlantic rip current, how would he possibly save them all? The statistics are grim Rip currents could be a major hazard along much of the US Gulf Coast this weekend because of Hurricane Beryl. And with temperatures so high, the desire to take a dip in the water will be strong. Be cautious, check local conditions and see below for more details about what to do if you\u2019re caught in one. Whether it\u2019s from these potentially dangerous currents, seemingly placid lakes or swimming pools, the drowning statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are shocking. In the CDC\u2019s most recently updated numbers, more than 4,000 fatal unintentional drownings happen every year in the United States (including boating incidents). That is an average of 11 drowning deaths per day. July tends to be the peak month for deaths. From 2018 to 2021, the states with the most drowning deaths per 100,000 people were the following: 1. Alaska2. Hawaii3. Montana4. Louisiana5. Florida Your odds of drowning are much, much higher than being attacked by a shark or an alligator. World drowning statistics are even more shocking. There are an estimated 236,000 annual drowning deaths worldwide, according to the UN\u2019s World Health Organization. That comes out to an average of 647 people per day. And then there are the even more numerous nonfatal drownings. The CDC says people who survive a drowning incident have a range of outcomes: \u201cFrom no injuries to very serious injuries or permanent disability.\u201d The tragedy is many of these deaths and injuries are preventable, experts say. What can you do to enjoy the water \u2014 be it ocean, river, lake or swimming pool \u2014 safely and not join the ranks of drowning deaths? Turns out, a lot. Who is most at risk? Knowing who is likely to drown is critical. At-risk groups need the most attention. In the United States, those include the following: \u2022 The youngest people: Children 1 to 4 have the highest drowning rates, the CDC says, mostly in swimming pools. \u2022 Males: They account for nearly 80% of fatal drownings in the United States. More risk-taking behaviors and alcohol use are cited as reasons. Across the world, WHO reports males have twice the fatal drowning rate of females. \u2022 People with seizure disorders: People with conditions such as epilepsy are at a higher risk for drowning, and that can happen in a bathtub. Drowning prevention tips The CDC emphasizes the importance of learning basic water safety skills, saying formal lessons can reduce the risk of drowning.  However, \u201cchildren who have had swimming lessons still need close and constant supervision when in or around water,\u201d the agency notes. Don\u2019t get distracted by TV, books or the phone when watching children in the water.  If you\u2019re drinking alcoholic beverages, stay out of the water and don\u2019t go boating. Impaired judgment and slow reactions can lead to tragedy. People in boats and weaker swimmers should wear life jackets, especially in open water. And keep an eye on the weather. Exit if there\u2019s a thunderstorm or heavy rains. Know the water environments Understand the waters you\u2019re about to enter. Different bodies of water carry different types of dangers: OCEAN RIP CURRENTS Rip currents flow away from shore. They often form at breaks in sandbars and close to piers and rock groins.  Look for signs of a rip current before entering, says the United States Lifesaving Association. That can be \u201ca narrow gap of darker, seemingly calmer water between areas of breaking waves and whitewater,\u201d a difference in water color or \u201ca line of foam, seaweed or debris moving seaward.\u201d Here\u2019s what to do you\u2019re caught in one: \u2022 Stay calm. Rip currents don\u2019t pull you underwater but do sweep you farther from shore. \u2022 Don\u2019t swim against the current. Try to escape by \u201cswimming out of the current in a direction following the shoreline,\u201d the USLA says. You may be able to escape by floating or treading water and ride the current out.  \u2022 If you\u2019re in trouble, yell and wave for help. If you\u2019re not trained, don\u2019t try to rescue people yourself. Seek a lifeguard, call 911 or throw a flotation device their way. Direct the person to swim parallel to the shoreline to escape. OTHER OCEAN TIPS The National Weather Service warns swimmers to watch out for \u201cshorebreak\u201d waves. They crash directly onto the sand and can batter and disorient swimmers. \u201cWhen in doubt, don\u2019t go out,\u201d said Wyatt Werneth, who is also the public service spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association. Swim Guide advises people to swim in the hour before or the hour after low tide or high tide when waters are generally calmer. (But conditions can vary beach to beach). RIVERS Tubing and other activities are popular in rivers. But swift currents and obstacles below the surface or debris can be hazardous.  Werneth said to research the river before you enter. LAKES AND PONDS The placid waters of lakes and ponds can lull waders and swimmers into a false sense of security. Sharp, sudden dropoffs and debris under the water can startle or entangle people, Werneth said, leading to panic and drowning. He said go in with a swim buddy. Dive only in designated areas. The USLA says enter unknown waters feet first to avoid striking your head. Swimmers shouldn\u2019t stray into areas where personal watercraft and boats are speeding by. SWIMMING POOLS The National Drowing Prevention Alliance has this advice for pool owners: \u201cfour-sided fencing with self-closing self-latching gates, door and window alarms, and safety covers can help make sure kids don\u2019t get to the water unsupervised.\u201d And even if your children know how to swim, adults should still maintain a careful watch. Keep flotation devices on hand. BOATING The National Park Service\u2019s \u201cOperation Dry Water\u201d reminds people that all vessels must carry personal flotation devices. National lifeguard shortage Werneth, who is also a spokesman for the American Lifeguard Association, has warned of an ongoing lifeguard shortage in the United States for years now. A June 15, 2024, news release from the ALA called the shortage in Florida \u201cdisturbing.\u201d Werneth said the group\u2019s message has always been \u201cswim in front of a lifeguard.\u201d But he said the reality of the shortage is prompting a new one: \u201cLearn to swim, America.\u201d \u201cWe want people to self-lifeguard. Assign someone in your family to be a water watcher. Have that person learn CPR.\u201d And if someone can\u2019t swim and still wants to wade, \u201cput a life jacket on them. That\u2019s going to make a difference.\u201d Werneth said that if you plan on going to a destination that features water activities, go online first to find out the lifeguard situation and adapt your plans as needed. Some pools, lakes and beaches might not even be open.  Operation Rescue Back in 2017 at that Florida beach, Werneth\u2019s task was daunting. But he had a cool head, decades of experience \u2014 and fortunately, a second experienced helper on hand whom he later learned was from the Air Force. \u201cHe was single-handedly pulling people out before I even got there. \u2026 That Air Force guy was kind of coming back with one. I saw that he had one that was kind of going unconscious, and I immediately jumped in the water, swam out, grabbed the unconscious person and got him out.\u201d Werneth guesses that they were about 50 yards out, and he recalls they ended up pulling five male teens out of the water. They weren\u2019t even in swimming attire, Werneth said, leading him to think it was a spur-of-the-moment decision to enter the ocean. Would the group have died without the rescue, which left him exhausted? \u201cI assure you they all would have. \u2026 These people were going in to help each other, and it caused a chain reaction.

{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_uk-election-labour-win-gbr-intl", "text": "The Labour Party has won a landslide victory in the UK general election, sweeping into power after 14 years of Conservative rule on the back of a wave of public disillusionment. Party leader Keir Starmer took over as prime minister on Friday after King Charles III formally asked him to form a new government, with the politician promising the British public he would steer the country towards \u201ccalmer waters.\u201d Starmer, 61, begins his term with what is one of the biggest parliamentary majorities in British history and is expected to introduce a program of far-reaching reforms. Addressing the nation from outside 10 Downing Street for the first time as prime minister, Starmer had one overarching message: Change starts now. \u201cIt is surely clear to everyone that our country needs a bigger reset, a rediscovery of who we are,\u201d he said, cautioning that the national renewal he was promising would take time. \u201cChanging a country is not like flipping a switch, the world is now a more volatile place,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party recorded the worst result in its history, prompting some commentators to observe that the overall election result was as much about British voters booting out the Conservatives as voting in Labour. The party lost more than 250 of the seats it had held in the 650-seat Parliament since 2019. \u00a0There were high-profile casualties, with the short-lived former Prime Minister Liz Truss and several cabinet ministers being booted out by voters. Conservative leader and, as of Friday morning, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took responsibility for the electoral wipeout, apologizing to voters in his farewell address. \u201cI have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change; and yours is the only judgment that matters,\u201d he said on the doorstep of the famous 10 Downing Street residence. Sunak announced he would resign as the leader of the Conservative Party as soon as arrangements were made to find his successor. \u201cI have heard your anger, your disappointment. And I take responsibility for this loss,\u201d he told voters as his wife Akshata Murty stood by. The handover of power is a swift \u2013 and sometimes brutal \u2013 process in the UK, with the outgoing prime minister replaced within hours of losing the election. In keeping with tradition, Sunak left Downing Street for the last time immediately after his speech and was driven the short distance to\u00a0Buckingham Palace to meet the King and hand in his resignation. Having conceded the election in the early hours of Friday, Sunak was out of the job by midday. An hour or so later, election winner Starmer arrived for a brief audience with the King. Leaving the palace as the newly minted prime minister, he then headed straight to Downing Street. The two politicians paid respectful tribute to each other, even though they did not meet in person on Friday. Sunak called his successor \u201ca decent, public-spirited man who I respect\u201d on his way out, while Starmer praised his predecessor\u2019s \u201cdedication and hard work\u201d and highlighted the significance of him being the first British Asian prime minister. Many winners, as many losers While the night was marked by a seismic shift in power from the Conservatives to Labour, other parties scored big wins. The Liberal Democrats went from winning just 11 seats at the 2019 general election to securing more than 70. Traditionally the third-biggest party across the UK, the Lib Dems have in the past struggled to break through and convert their relatively high vote share into parliamentary seats because of the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system, which favors the biggest parties. Reform UK, the insurgent rightwing populist party, won roughly 14% of the vote but took only five seats in parliament, having split the rightwing vote in many places and further hurt the Conservatives. The grouping is led by Nigel Farage, the face of the Brexit movement and an ally of former US President Donald Trump. Farage himself was elected a member of parliament (MP) for the first time \u2013 after running unsuccessfully seven times in the past. It was a good night too for the Green Party. While the party stood candidates in a record number of constituencies in this election, its official goal was to win four seats - and it succeeded in all four, managing to take two seats from the Conservatives. Meanwhile, the Scottish National Party, or SNP, had a disastrous night, suffering a near total wipeout and ending up with just nine seats, compared to 47 previously. While that defeat might put the push for an independent Scotland on the backburner for now, in Northern Ireland the Irish nationalist Sinn F\u00e9in became the biggest party, overtaking the Democratic Unionist Party, or DUP. Sinn F\u00e9in advocates for a united Ireland and boycotts the UK Parliament, traditionally abstaining from Westminster politics. The DUP, meanwhile, wants a tighter relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Turnout nationwide was low, at just below 60% - only the second time in the past century that more than 40% of voters decided to stay home. And although Labour won by a landslide in terms of seats in parliament, the popular vote showed the party\u2019s win was not a resounding victory. Labour only increased its vote share by a few percentage points from its dismal 2019 showing. Government-building and soul searching Starmer began to form his government on Friday, promising the public he would start working immediately. He appointed Rachel Reeves as the UK\u2019s first female treasury chief and his long-time deputy party leader Angela Rayner as his deputy PM. The new cabinet is expected to mirror Starmer\u2019s former shadow government, although some Labour MPs might see their roles diminished following a poorer than expected showing in their individual constituencies.\u00a0\u00a0Starmer also named David Lammy as Foreign Secretary and Yvette Cooper as Home Secretary. The new prime minister begins his tenure with a strong personal mandate. The huge Labour victory is seen by many as his personal success. His rise to the top job caps what has been a remarkable, and swift, transformation of the Labour Party since the last general election in 2019, when it suffered its worst loss in a generation under its former hard-left leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who, in another twist was re-elected as an independent after being expelled from Labour. Starmer has moved the party back toward the center, promising sustainable public finances, no increases in income taxes and a green agenda. Labour\u2019s tally ended up just shy of the record-breaking majority secured by Tony Blair in 1997. The party\u2019s stance on the war in Gaza may have been a factor, as might weeks of opinion polls predicting a massive Labour win, which may have impacted turnout. Several pro-Palestinian independent candidates took seats that were expected to fall into Labour hands. Starmer \u2013 a former human rights lawyer \u2013 said shortly after the October 7 attacks by Hamas that Israel \u201chas the right\u201d to withhold power and water from Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but added: \u201cObviously, everything should be done within international law.\u201d The party has since become increasingly critical of Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza and now supports a ceasefire, along with the return of hostages held by Hamas. Meanwhile, the Tories, as the Conservatives are often referred to in the UK, must now endeavor to figure out where it all went so terribly wrong. The party has likely paid a price for what are widely seen as years of chaos and a worsening standard of living under its watch. A notable trigger for that turmoil was the decision by the then Prime Minister David Cameron to call a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. What started out as Cameron\u2019s attempt to shut down the Euroskeptic opposition within his own party brought on years of uncertainty and infighting followed by Brexit \u2013 while many voters still support the country\u2019s departure from the EU, it has caused Britons to be worse off than they used to be. The Brexit debacle was followed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its handling in Britain was marked by a series of scandals involving top government officials, including Sunak and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who were fined for breaching the same rules they had imposed on citizens. A cost-of-living crisis that hit much of Europe and the United States, exacerbated by energy prices sent soaring by the war in Ukraine, was made worse in the UK by the Truss government\u2019s disastrous tax-cutting gamble, which caused a political and economic meltdown and sent the cost of borrowing skyrocketing. But with turnout plunging to the lowest level in decades, one thing is certain: like elsewhere in the world, many people in the United Kingdom have become disillusioned with politics, losing their hope for a better future. It will be up to Keir Starmer to convince them otherwise \u2013 a tough job given the sluggish economy, war in Ukraine and the Middle East and the unfolding climate crisis.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/uk-election-labour-win-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Vatican said in a statement that the prelate had refused to \u201crecognize and submit\u201d to the authority of the pope, and had rejected \u201ccommunion\u201d with members of the Catholic Church and its authoritative teachings. In 2018, Vigan\u00f2 released a bombshell dossier calling on Francis to resign and\u00a0accusing the pope of knowing about allegations of abuse\u00a0of trainee priests carried out by the former cardinal of Washington, DC, Theodore McCarrick, and failing to act.\u00a0A Vatican inquiry later challenged Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account\u00a0and cleared Francis. As a Vatican diplomat, the archbishop was tasked with serving the pope, which makes his excommunication for schism highly unusual. The ruling means the archbishop cannot receive the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church, such as communion. The Vatican explained Friday that Vigan\u00f2 was excommunicated following an \u201cextrajudicial penal process,\u201d although the archbishop has said he did not \u201crecognize the legitimacy\u201d of the process. Recently, the archbishop has said Francis\u2019 election to the papacy should be considered \u201cnull and void\u201d and has instead accused the pope of \u201cheresy and schism.\u201d He has accused the pontiff of supporting what he called the \u201cclimate fraud\u201d and has criticized him for backing Covid-19 vaccines and for promoting an\u00a0\u201cinclusive, immigrationist, eco-sustainable, and gay-friendly\u201d church. Vigan\u00f2 was also at the center of controversy for arranging a meeting between the pope and Kim Davis, a Kentucky clerk who refused to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples, during the pope\u2019s 2015 visit to the US. The Vatican later said the meeting \u201cshould not be considered a form of support of her position.\u201d Following Vigan\u00f2\u2019s 2018 call for the pope to resign, several bishops in the US issued statements of support for the archbishop, which were\u00a0criticized by some commentators. For some, the archbishop had been seen as an effective diplomat and official in years gone by. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See\u2019s Secretary of State, said recently about the now-excommunicated archbishop. The Vatican said Vigan\u00f2 had been told of the excommunication and that only the Holy See could lift the sanction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/archbishop-vigano-excommunicated-schism-pope-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_popes-chief-of-staff-london-property-trial-intl-latam", "text": "One of Pope Francis\u2019 closest aides has undergone an intense cross-examination as he gave evidence in a case that marks the first time the Vatican has stood trial in an English court. Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, who holds the role of \u201csostituto\u201d (\u201csubstitute\u201d), the equivalent of a papal chief of staff, took the witness stand in a dispute over the Holy See\u2019s disastrous investment in a London property, the center of the Vatican\u2019s\u00a0\u201ctrial of the century\u201d. The archbishop\u2019s appearance in court is rare given the Vatican and its senior officials have largely avoided legal actions in foreign courts \u2013 often concerning sexual abuse cases \u2013 under the protection of sovereign immunity. But the London legal action is believed to be the first time the Vatican has stood trial in a foreign jurisdiction, while Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra is one of the highest-ranking Vatican officials to give evidence in such a case. The 64-year-old Venezuelan archbishop wore a black clerical suit during his evidence and began by swearing an oath on \u201calmighty God\u201d that he would tell the truth. Although he was occasionally assisted by an interpreter, he answered questions in English. Over more than a day and a half of cross-examination, the archbishop insisted several times that he is a \u201cpriest, and not a specialist in banking\u201d as he explained that the Vatican had been the victim of extortion in the property deal. The case against the Holy See has been bought by Raffaele Mincione, an Italian-British financier who was among those convicted by a Vatican court last December of embezzlement and self-laundering for his part in the London property deal. Mincione has denied all the charges against him and is appealing his convictions. That trial marked the first time a cardinal was convicted and sentenced by a Vatican court for financial crimes and is considered an important moment\u00a0in Pope Francis\u2019 long battle to clean up the Vatican\u2019s finances. But Mincione is now seeking a ruling in the London courts that he acted in\u00a0\u201cgood faith\u201d throughout his dealings with the Vatican, which concerned\u00a0investments in a\u00a0vast property in southwest London\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood,\u00a0originally\u00a0built as a car showroom for the Harrods department store. The Holy See says it spent around $400 million on the deal over several years but ended up with losses of $150 million after eventually selling the asset. In 2014, the Vatican invested $200 million for a 45% stake in the Chelsea property through a fund run by Mincione, whose companies had purchased the building for around $165 million (\u00a3129.5 million) at the end of 2012. Although there was a plan to turn the property into apartments, the Vatican says the property\u2019s value was inflated by Mincione and that it was losing money on its investment. Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra, who was not in post at the time of the original investment, sought to exit the deal by buying the building outright and, in the process, the Holy See paid \u00a340 million to Mincione. The Vatican says this was a \u201cfraudulent overpayment.\u201d Helping to broker the exit deal in 2018 from Mincione\u2019s fund was another financier, Gianluigi Torzi, who was also convicted at the Vatican trial last December. He was found to have structured a deal which left him in control of the building and the Vatican purchasing an\u00a0\u201cempty box\u201d. Torzi was then accused of extorting around $16 million from the Vatican as Pe\u00f1a Parra and his office sought to finally gain control of the Chelsea building. The property was eventually sold by the Holy See in 2022 for around $229 million. Under cross-examination the archbishop was questioned repeatedly about the Torzi payments and was accused by Mincione\u2019s barrister of dishonesty because the payments to Torzi involved a false invoice. The archbishop admitted to sending a false invoice but said Torzi had \u201ctrapped\u201d the Vatican and would \u201clie and lie.\u201d Pe\u00f1a Parra told the judge repeatedly that he had been trying to extricate the Holy See from a bad deal and gain control of the building. The archbishop, who became the Vatican number three in October 2018, said he only became aware of Torzi\u2019s schemes later and that some of his staff were \u201csuperficial and na\u00efve.\u201d He insisted that now \u201cI would give Torzi nothing, and I would put him in jail several times.\u201d Mincione\u2019s lawyers have accused the Vatican of an \u201cincoherent and confused allegation of conspiracy\u201d against their client, while the Holy See insist that Mincione did not act in good faith. Mincione was also cross examined during the trial, with lawyers accusing him of producing \u201cgrossly misleading\u201d figures about the Chelsea property\u2019s value. The heart of the dispute concerns the value of the Chelsea property. The Vatican\u2019s legal team said the stated value of \u00a3275 million ($350 million) for the London property in 2018 was a \u201cfraudulent representation\u201d of its market worth, while Mincione\u2019s lawyers denied this, saying it was an \u201caudited valuation.\u201d In his witness statement, Pe\u00f1a Parra said he was told of \u201cconcerns\u201d that the value of the building was less than the Vatican had \u201coriginally thought.\u201d The trial is expected to conclude later this month with a judgment likely to be released later in the year. The archbishop is due to conclude giving evidence on Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/popes-chief-of-staff-london-property-trial-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a first for the brand, this year there is also a \u201c100% recycled\u201d polo shirt in the mix. \u201cRalph Lauren has once again created designs that not only capture the essence of American style but also embody the spirit and pride of Team USA,\u201d Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThis iconic apparel serves as a symbol of unity and inspiration for both our team and the millions of fans who will be cheering them on.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/style/team-usa-olympic-uniforms-ralph-lauren/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_australia_australia-remains-child-crocodile-attack-intl-scli", "text": "Australian police believe they have found the remains of a 12-year-old child reportedly attacked by a crocodile while swimming in a creek in the Northern Territory, they said on Thursday. \u201cThis is devastating news for the family, the community and everyone involved in the search,\u201d senior sergeant Erica Gibson said in a statement. \u201cPolice are providing support to the family and community, along with the first responders who attended the scene.\u201d The child was reported missing on Tuesday evening after swimming in Palumpa, also known by its Aboriginal name Nganmarriyanga, a remote town of around 350 people, seven hours by road from the Northern Territory\u2019s capital, Darwin. A search and rescue operation with community assistance was launched to find the child, and police scoured a large section of the creek by boat, they said on Wednesday. The search team was authorized to \u201cremove the crocodile from the area,\u201d Northern Territory police minister Brent Potter said, according to CNN affiliate 7news. By Thursday, efforts to capture the animal were still ongoing, Gibson added, per The Associated Press. There are more than 100,000 crocodiles \u2013 which can grow up to six meters (20 feet) long \u2013 in the Northern Territory, though fatal attacks are relatively rare. Palumpa has witnessed similar incidents in recent years. A 54-year-old suffered bites to his chest and arm when he was attacked by a 2-meter-long (6.6-foot) crocodile in 2017, 7news reported, while four years earlier, a saltwater crocodile that was reportedly blocking children\u2019s route to school was shot dead. Since crocodiles became a protected species in Australia in the 1970s, their population has grown rapidly in the north, as has the number of large crocodiles because they continue to grow as they age and can live up to 70 years old, AP reported.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/australia/australia-remains-child-crocodile-attack-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_europe_viktor-orban-visits-kyiv-intl", "text": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor\u00a0Orban has made his first visit to Kyiv since Russia\u2019s full-scale war began, and urged Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider a \u201cceasefire\u201d in order to \u201cspeed up peace talks\u201d with Moscow. Standing alongside Zelensky on Tuesday, Orban, who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has criticized European support for Ukraine, said: \u201cI asked the president to think about whether we could reverse the order, and speed up peace talks, with making a ceasefire first.\u201d Orban continued: \u201cA ceasefire connected to a deadline would give a chance to speed up peace talks. I explored this possibility with the president and I am grateful for his honest answers and negotiation.\u201d The Hungarian leader has touted the idea of ending the war with\u00a0a ceasefire as opposed to military support for Ukraine numerous times since Russia\u2019s military flooded across the border in 2022. Zelensky dismissed the idea, according to his office. Speaking on national TV on Monday, Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of Zelensky\u2019s office, said that even though Orban \u201cwas given the opportunity to express his thoughts\u201d during his visit to Kyiv, Zelensky\u2019s position on this issue \u201cis clear, understandable and known.\u201d Zelensky previously rejected French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Olympic ceasefire proposal citing its potential to inadvertently benefit Russians on the ground. According to Zhovkva, Kyiv\u2019s number one tool to end hostilities is through a second peace summit, which Ukraine is already preparing for. \u201cWe are saying that Ukraine will draft its peace plan, a roadmap for establishing peace in Ukraine. It will develop it with all the states that are ready. Hungary is also ready for this. And then, if the aggressor country is ready to listen to this plan, ready to talk about this plan, and not to speak the language of ultimatums, then yes, during the second summit, we can say that representatives of the Russian Federation may attend this summit in one way or another,\u201d he said. Orban also stated his desire to improve relations between Budapest and Kyiv, which have been strained by the Hungarian leader\u2019s close relationship with Putin. \u201cWe would like to make the relationship between the two countries better,\u201d Orban said. \u201cWe would like to make a broad bilateral agreement with Ukraine, similar to the ones we already made with our neighbors (in the past). We would be happy to take part in the modernization of Ukraine\u2019s economy, we would like an ordered framework for this.\u201d The authoritarian Hungarian leader has regularly attempted to block European Union initiatives offering further military and financial support to Kyiv during the conflict. The Hungarian prime minister\u2019s close relationship with Putin has frequently come under scrutiny. Their bond is underpinned by both economic cooperation and some shared values. Both leaders have also enacted anti-LGBTQ policies and clamped down on freedom of speech in their countries. Hungary has supported Russia at a United Nations level and rejected EU sanctions following Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine as early as 2014, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea. Tuesday\u2019s meeting comes as Orban and Hungary take control of the EU Council\u2019s rotating presidency, which changes every six months. During each six-month period, the country controlling the presidency does not take control of the EU\u2019s overall agenda, but does have a platform through which they can hammer home their own priorities. On the EU Council\u2019s website, it likens holding the presidency \u201cto someone hosting a dinner, making sure their guests all gather in harmony,\u201d adding that to \u201cguarantee effectiveness, the presidency acts as an \u2018honest broker,\u2019 rising above the holder\u2019s own national interest.\u201d Orban took control of the presidency on Monday with a call to \u201cMake Europe Great Again,\u201d a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s political slogan that will alarm many of his European counterparts who are braced for the former US president\u2019s potential return to the White House, concerned about what it will mean for the EU. Other key European diplomatic meetings are planned for July. NATO will celebrate 75 years of the alliance in Washington, DC between July 9 and 11. The agenda for that event is expected to be dominated by long-term plans to support Ukraine and conversations about its eventual accession to the alliance. The European Political Community (EPC), a forum for 47 European countries, inside and outside the EU, to discuss the continent\u2019s strategic challenges, will also meet on July 18 in the United Kingdom. Ukraine and Hungary are both members of the EPC. It is expected that Ukraine will dominate that agenda and Zelensky may attend the meeting in person. Orban may have had this in mind when timing this trip to Kyiv, ensuring that his first meeting with Ukraine\u2019s president since the start of the war was not in such a public and high-stakes diplomatic setting.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_termessos-turkey-hidden-ancient-mountaintop-city", "text": "Alexander the Great tried to conquer Termessos but failed. Today, the incredible deserted ruins of this once-powerful city, perched like a fortified eagle\u2019s nest high in the mountains of southwestern Turkey, can be conquered by anyone willing to make the hike up here. But few people ever do. Termessos stands empty. A spectacular archeological jewel, preserved in isolation, seen only by a few handfuls of people who make the trip from the beach resorts of nearby tourism hot spot Antalya. That\u2019s a shame for those who miss out. For those who do get to explore, it\u2019s a major bonus. They get to wander around one of Turkey\u2019s most impressive ancient cities all by themselves. It\u2019s a place of incredible atmosphere: history and landscape; views and silence; nature and destruction \u2013 all combining to create one of the Mediterranean\u2019s great unsung archaeological wonders. Here, slowly being swallowed by vegetation and worn down by time, are gigantic mausoleums, vast underground cisterns, temples, imposing city walls and a breathtaking theater perched, like Machu Picchu, on a hilltop that offers views stretching for miles all around. Despite its emptiness, Termessos is easy to reach. It only takes around 45 minutes to drive from Antalya\u2019s traffic-snarled downtown to the gates of Mount G\u00fcll\u00fck-Termessos National Park \u2013 a protected wildlife haven that surrounds the ruins. After paying a three-euro (about $3) gate fee at the park\u2019s entrance, visitors then face another 10-minute ride further into the pine and gorse-clad hills along a switchback road that reaches about 1,000 meters above sea level. Eventually the road emerges into what seems like an uninteresting parking lot with a public restroom. This was, in fact, at one time a giant agora, or marketplace for the city, which in its heyday 2,000 years ago would\u2019ve been bustling with traders and citizens. It\u2019s here where the Termessos adventure begins. And it begins with death. Tomb raiders Hidden by vegetation at one end of the agora are the stone-strewn remains of what was clearly once a grand street leading away along the hillside. Instead of houses or shops, this was lined with the tombs of Termessos\u2019 rich and mighty. Ancient sarcophagi carved with clues to who they once contained, like shields and spears for warriors, lie scattered. Some are small, others huge \u2013 offering clues to levels of wealth or power. Some are unfinished, their huge pedestals hinting at what would\u2019ve been. All of them have been broken into by raiders over the centuries, their walls smashed or lids prised off despite once being locked shut with metal clasps. Tree roots and ivy creepers have also snaked through the stonework. \u201cThe thieves working here were very good at their jobs,\u201d says \u00d6nder U\u011fuz, an Antalya-based art teacher and licensed guide who offers tours of Termessos, which he\u2019s been captivated by since first coming here as a student in 1996 (\u201cIt was love at first sight!\u201d). Reaching the heart of the ancient city involves an uphill hike along a leafy pathway that\u2019s a little rough and steep in places. Visitors here need to be equipped with sturdy footwear and OK with mildly strenuous hiking on tricky terrain. In summer, it\u2019s best to visit early before temperatures start to climb, and bring water. Soon the lower city walls loom into view \u2013 a first hint at how well-defended Termessos was when it was built perhaps around the fourth or fifth century BCE, long before the Romans showed up with the engineering skills that would transform the known world. Which raises the question: how did the people of Termessos do it? U\u011fuz laughs off the suggestion of any mystery here. We\u2019re too caught up in the achievements of our technological age to appreciate even the basic abilities of our distant ancestors, in his opinion. \u201cYou and I, we\u2019re nothing without our computers and social media accounts,\u201d he says (shortly after taking a snap for his own Instagram feed). \u201cTake those away and we are helpless. Not these people. They worked with stone for centuries. They had nothing else. Building things like this was what they knew how to do.\u201d The people of Termessos were known as Solyms, descendants of Luwians, an ancient civilization that was spread across what is now Turkey, but largely overlooked by archaeological scholars until the past few decades. To this day, little is known about the Solyms or when they constructed their city. But they clearly knew what they were doing. Their choice of location showed a genius for strategic thinking. Not only was it on a major trade route, enabling it to grow wealthy on goods and payments from people heading to and from the Mediterranean, its altitude and commanding views made it easy to defend. Which is why when Alexander the Great showed up around 333 BCE \u2013 when Termessos made its first real appearance in the history books \u2013 he was apparently unable to invade or blockade the city into surrender, despite multiple attempts. He reputedly called the city an \u201ceagle\u2019s nest.\u201d Later, the Romans had more success in controlling the city. Not through force, says U\u011fuz, but through more insidious means, like offering autonomy under Roman \u201cprotection.\u201d \u201cThe Romans were like the mafia,\u201d he suggests. Fight school Climbing higher up the hillside on a rocky path sprouting with fragrant wild sage, there\u2019s more evidence of how sophisticated life in Termessos would\u2019ve been. To the left, there\u2019s the marble ruins of the city\u2019s gymnasium, a kind of college campus for trainee soldiers, complete with bathhouse and refectory. Some of the main building is still intact, with indications that impressive arches once ran across its front wall. Inside were two floors, plus a subterranean vault for storage. In front is the palaestra, an area that would\u2019ve been used for wrestling and combat training and which today is littered with pieces of the gymnasium\u2019s terracotta roof tiles. It is, of course, mostly derelict. Termessos was believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake the exact date of which is not known, but possibly the 4th or 5th century. What remains is not the work of archeological reconstruction. It\u2019s the genuine state the building has been left in for the past 1,600 years. Here, the silence and emptiness of the place allow the imagination to wander \u2013 bringing those warriors back to life and allowing visualization of their mock battles in a place that has changed so little over time. Further up, the upper city walls give commanding views of the forest below and offer a good vantage point over anyone trying to sneak up for an invasion. Beyond them is more evidence of civilization. There are the remains of a covered water drainage system. And for a city that had few water sources, they are one of its most impressive assets \u2013 gigantic multi-chambered underground cisterns carved by hand into solid rock and lined with plaster. Capable of holding up to 1,500 tons of water, these cavernous containers would\u2019ve been vital to the survival of a city that had few natural sources of H2O \u2013 especially when Alexander the Great was mounting blockades. Today, they\u2019re filled with broken columns and other rubble, likely dumped there when the city was abandoned. There\u2019s speculation water shortages could\u2019ve been behind a decision to finally relocate the city elsewhere. Luxury shops Nearby, there\u2019s the imposing outer wall of the bouleuterion or assembly house that would\u2019ve been the city\u2019s seat of power, another central agora dating back to pre-Roman times and the ruins of a colonnaded street that once housed the city\u2019s most exclusive shops. \u201cThis is the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Termessos,\u201d says U\u011fuz. Like the Parisian upscale retail boulevard, this would\u2019ve been where the wealthy spent their cash, he explains. The finest olive oils, cloths, leather goods and items imported from all around the Mediterranean would\u2019ve been on sale here. These are all sideshows to the city\u2019s showstopper attraction: the theater After a last scramble over huge slabs of marble, the view opens up onto an epic panorama of the large performance space, perched on the city\u2019s highest point. The setting is breathtaking, with mountain ravines cascading away on either side. The sheer drop behind the theater\u2019s upper walls is dizzying. It\u2019s a reminder to be careful when exploring ruins that haven\u2019t been fenced off for safety. With room for about 4,000 people, the semi-circle of stone terraces faces the ruins of what would\u2019ve been a stage. The theater probably predated the arrival of the Romans, but was later updated along Roman lines. In Termessos, the location is particularly significant, as it sits opposite a mountain that was once sacred to the city\u2019s inhabitants. It\u2019s easy to see why this was such a hallowed spot, with views that, on haze-free days, stretch as far as the port of Antalya. And again, it\u2019s a place to sit and imagine what life was like nearly 2,000 years ago, when such theaters would\u2019ve been used by the Romans as, according to U\u011fuz, a propaganda tool - a soft force to keep their empire in check. As history lessons go, this is pretty spectacular. U\u011fuz (who can be contacted via email: onder.uguz@gmail.com) says he never tires of exploring Termessos. He also offers tours of other more popular archaeological sites in the area, but the tranquility and beauty of this hidden ancient wonder draw him back time and again. He particularly loves soaking in the vistas from the city\u2019s upper walls. \u201cUsually, I\u2019m sitting there with my wife, under a juniper tree in springtime, a beautiful blue sky with this great scenery,\u201d he says, adding that year-round, the solitude offered by Termessos is also an attraction. \u201cFor me it\u2019s perfect. Just you and nature; little squirrels and archaeology. The only thing missing is a cold beer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/termessos-turkey-hidden-ancient-mountaintop-city/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

The snap vote, called by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is being held months earlier than necessary and caught much of his party by surprise. The opposition Labour party suffered its worst defeat since 1935 in the last general election, but has since rebuilt itself under the leadership of Keir Starmer. Thursday\u2019s vote follows a six-week campaign in which all major parties have scoured the country in search of votes. Much of the debate has revolved around the economy, the cost of living, the state of Britain\u2019s public services, and tax and immigration. Largely absent from the debate, however, has been Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union, which it left in 2020 after a referendum four years earlier. Britain has had three Conservative prime ministers since the last general election in 2019, which Boris Johnson won by a landslide. But after much of the country and his party soured on Johnson, Conservative party members voted in 2022 to replace him with Liz Truss, who became the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) then voted to replace her with Sunak. During the campaign, Nigel Farage \u2013 one of the most prominent champions of Brexit \u2013 announced his return to frontline politics to lead the nascent hard-right Reform UK party. Sunak, Starmer, Farage and the heads of all other major parties are expected to make appearances at their own local polling stations throughout the day. Around 46.5 million Brits are eligible to vote in the election. They are casting their ballots in 650 separate constituencies across the nations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with 326 seats required for a party to form a majority government. News outlets are barred from reporting anything that could influence voters while polls are opened. An exit poll from British broadcasters will project the seat totals are soon as polls shut at 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET), and counting will take place throughout the night and into Friday morning.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/uk-general-election-polls-open-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

It said that under the memorandum of understanding the US would also support Panama with \u201cequipment, transportation and logistics\u201d regarding foreigners found \u201cin violation of the immigration laws of Panama.\u201d Panama agreed to \u201ccomply with all international agreements and conventions on the rights of immigrants and those in refugee status,\u201d it added. Panama is home to the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, that has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. News of the agreement comes after Panama\u2019s new President Jose Raul Mulino vowed on Monday that the Central American nation would no longer be a country of transit for migrants. \u201cI will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony. \u201cPanama will no longer be a transit country for illegals,\u201d he said amid cheers from those present. \u201cThe numbers of illegal immigrants passing through the Dari\u00e9n are shocking,\u201d Mulino said, adding that he intends to \u201cappeal to international solidarity regarding the cause that generates the problem and will seek solutions with the countries involved, especially with the United States, which is the final destination of such immigrants.\u201d Mulino said that he\u2019s seen first-hand \u201cthe magnitude of the problem and the dimension of the humanitarian and environmental crisis\u201d that migration causes to the Dari\u00e9n Gap. \u201cThe Dari\u00e9n must continue to be a great green lung, not only for us but for the entire region.

Its biodiversity cannot be put at risk by illicit activities.\u201d Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to Panama\u2019s National Migration Service.

{"id": "travel_stranger-invite-vacation-italy-chance-encounter", "text": "Carter Leathers was sitting at a table on the terrace of a boutique hotel in the center of Florence, Italy \u2013 sipping a Negroni and trying to quieten her nerves. The courtyard was peaceful, open and airy, dotted with aperitivo-hour drinkers. Carter tried to soak up the Florentine vibes \u2013 and avoid checking her phone and reading the inevitable anxious messages from her mother. Then through the stone arches into the courtyard, walked a tall, confident-looking guy in a blue suit. This must be Max Ratzenb\u00f6ck, thought Carter. The man was looking around the courtyard, and then his eyes met Carter\u2019s. He started smiling, looking instantly pleased to see her. This feeling was mutual. Carter smiled back. \u201cWow, he looks good,\u201d Carter thought to herself. Carter and Max said their hellos. And soon Max was sitting opposite Carter, his own Negroni in hand. \u201cOnce we started talking, we just kept smiling at each other,\u201d Carter tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe just hit it off.\u201d The decision to meet up in Florence no longer felt quite so crazy. \u201cOkay, yeah. This is going to work,\u201d Carter recalls thinking. An \u2018Eat, Pray, Love\u2019 trip It was late August 2022. Carter, a 35-year-old esthetician from Sacramento, California, was on what she calls an \u201cEat, Pray, Love-style\u201d vacation in Europe. Earlier that summer, Carter had dated a guy in California and she\u2019d hoped their relationship might go somewhere. Instead, it unceremoniously ended. In the wake of that disappointment, Carter made a conscious choice to shift her priorities. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m just going to go do my own thing. I\u2019m not waiting for anybody,\u2019\u201d she thought. With that mindset, Carter booked a solo trip to Europe. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to go and explore and kind of see what happens, and see who I meet,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. Carter was excited for a change of scene, a change of pace. She loves art and imagined herself whiling away afternoons in galleries in picturesque European cities \u2013 without having to accommodate a partner\u2019s needs or requirements. While putting together her itinerary, Carter knew Florence and Rome were non-negotiable stop-offs. But she wasn\u2019t sure about her third destination. She weighed up options and in the end, she got inspiration from an unlikely place: an episode of reality television show \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d filmed in Vienna, Austria. The episode included sweeping shots of the historic buildings and green parks. \u201cThe city looked so pretty,\u201d recalls Carter. Flights booked and hotel reservations made, Carter decided to switch her dating app location settings to Vienna. Carter\u2019s app of choice was Bumble, which prompts women to make the first move in hetrosexual pairings. \u201cI was like, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s see what the guys look like in Vienna,\u2019\u201d Carter recalls. And that\u2019s when Carter saw Max Ratzenb\u00f6ck for the first time. \u201cAs I started swiping, he was the second guy that came up and I was just like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I hope we match,\u2019\u201d Carter recalls. A couple of hours later, Carter\u2019s phone pinged: Max from Vienna had liked her back. It was a match. A dating app match In the summer of 2022 Max was a 31-year-old Austrian comedian finding his footing in his personal life and career in the wake of the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019d just moved into the apartment I\u2019d always wanted to have \u2013 it was in the middle of Vienna, it\u2019s an old apartment, a bit of a bachelor pad,\u201d Max tells CNN Travel today. \u201cI was acting and I\u2019m a comedian. But since Covid, I left the stage, basically, because at that time, the stage was not really an option.\u201d Like many comedians in the wake of the pandemic, Max turned to TikTok. He found some success posting comedic videos there, and became focused on growing his social media audience, while also juggling his day job at an advertising agency. \u201cBasically that\u2019s what all I was doing \u2013 meeting with friends and working \u2013 and then I took a chance on Bumble too,\u201d says Max. Max vividly remembers the moment he opened the dating app and saw Carter for the first time. \u201cThere\u2019s this gorgeous-looking lady on my front page,\u201d he recalls. Max was so struck by Carter, he remembers questioning if she was \u201ceven real.\u201d \u201cI would get that question a lot, if I was real,\u201d says Carter today. \u201cThey\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh this is a fake profile.\u2019\u201d Max swiped to the right \u201cimmediately.\u201d Then he got the notification: Carter liked him too, it was a match. Max couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThat turned out to be a very good decision,\u201d says Max, of his decision to swipe right on Carter\u2019s profile. \u201cThe best I ever made.\u201d Max and Carter started messaging back and forth right away, with Carter explaining to Max she was based in the US, but would be visiting Europe in a few weeks time. Their messages were light, flirty, and friendly. Carter suggested Max could maybe show her around Vienna. \u201cI was totally, totally doing that,\u201d says Max. \u201cI blocked all my stuff out of my calendar to have four to five days to show Carter around Vienna.\u201d A spontaneous decision Carter and Max exchanged regular messages in the lead up to her arrival in Europe. Then, when Carter got to Italy, she and Max switched from chatting on Bumble to using messaging app WhatsApp. And now they were in the same time zone, their back and forth became even more frequent. \u201cWhen I was in Rome, I started texting him more and more,\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, he seems like a nice guy.\u2019 But you never know who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d Carter was excited, but also a little wary about the idea of meeting up with a total stranger in a foreign country. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to meet up with this guy, I should FaceTime him to make sure he\u2019s real,\u201d she thought. So one evening, while she was relaxing on the balcony of her Rome hotel room, Carter spontaneously hit the call button on her cell phone. Some 700 miles away in Vienna, Max was sitting at home, playing video games online with friends. \u201cIt was a Saturday night. It was summer, it was really hot,\u201d recalls Max. \u201cI think I\u2019d played basketball, had a nice shower, and now there was a nice summer breeze coming in. And then she called me for the first time.\u201d Max saw Carter\u2019s name pop up on his phone and immediately dropped the video game controller. \u201cI told my friends to get off \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m not here for the next two or three games,\u2019\u201d recalls Max. \u201cAnd then we had our first talk face to face. She was on her balcony having a glass of red wine in Rome.\u201d Carter thought it was \u201cendearing\u201d that, rather than being out partying on a Saturday night, Max was home playing video games. She felt it boded well for their potential connection. \u201cI\u2019m more of a homebody too,\u201d explains Carter. And even though she\u2019d called him out of the blue, Max looked thrilled to speak with her. The video chat quashed any worries Carter had about meeting Max in person. \u201cIt just felt really easy talking to him,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, this is nice. I like this guy.\u2019\u201d During the FaceTime call, Carter mentioned she was going to be going to Florence next. Max then spoke a bit about his memories of Florence \u2013 it was a city he\u2019d visited multiple times, as he\u2019d spent regular family vacations in Tuscany growing up. As Max described his fondness for Florence, a thought crossed Carter\u2019s mind. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna be wandering around the city by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you actually want to come meet me in Florence?\u201d Carter pretty much assumed Max would say no \u2013 she figured he\u2019d be busy, unable to make it work, unwillingly to spontaneously travel to Italy. But to her surprise, Max just smiled and said yes immediately. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d recalls Max. \u201cI was completely stoked to meet her. We\u2019d been talking for a couple of weeks and it intensified over time. So I got that flight to Florence.\u201d An Italian rendez-vous That\u2019s how Carter came to be waiting for Max in the hotel courtyard on August 31, 2022 sipping her Negroni. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018This is either going to go really good or really bad,\u2019\u201d Carter recalls. \u201cI was trying not to be nervous.\u201d Max was nervous too. When he told a close friend about his plans, his friend was pretty blunt. \u201cOh, wow,\u201d the friend said. \u201cEither this is going to become the biggest romance of all time, or it\u2019s going to be the worst holiday of your life.\u201d \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d said Max. Carter\u2019s mother, meanwhile, was \u201cso worried.\u201d In a series of frantic texts, she told Carter to hide her passport, and send updates as soon as she\u2019d met Max in person. Despite the nerves \u2013 and their loved ones\u2019 apprehension \u2013 as soon as Carter and Max met in person on the Florence hotel terrace, they both felt certain they\u2019d made the right decision. They spent the rest of the evening chatting, flirting and laughing over cocktails. This evening set the tone for the rest of the four days, in which they were together pretty much 24/7. \u201cWe just hit it off so well that I was like, \u2018Just stay with me. I want you to stay with me,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cAnd so he ended up staying with me in my hotel the rest of the time in Florence. Pretty much from the moment we met, we were together.\u201d In Florence, Carter and Max spent the days sightseeing around the city and evenings ducking into osterias to share bottles of wine and bowls of pasta. They took photos together \u2013 including their first-ever picture, posing on Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge \u2013 something that should have been awkward, but they both wanted to capture the moment. Carter texted the pictures to her mother and sister. \u201cWow, you look great together,\u201d they replied. Max also sent the Ponte Vecchio photo to his mother. \u201cI told her right away,\u201d recalls Max. \u201cI said: \u2018Wow, look at that picture, isn\u2019t she beautiful? We hit it off and it\u2019s going great.\u2019\u201d When their time in Florence came to an end, Carter and Max traveled on to Vienna, together. \u201cIt was three, four days in Florence,\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cAnd then another four days in Vienna,\u201d adds Max. \u201cSo our first date lasted a week,\u201d says Carter, laughing. Falling in love in Vienna After the amazing time in Florence, Max was excited to show Carter around Vienna, the city he called home. \u201cI was pretty eager to give her the cr\u00e8me-de-la-cr\u00e8me tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a very proud Austrian. I\u2019m very happy with this capital city. We have this very beautiful city.\u201d Unlike Florence and Rome, Vienna is \u201cnever really on the list of places for Americans who do Europe,\u201d says Max. \u201cThat\u2019s so weird to me,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the center of culture. And it\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d Max was determined Carter would fall in love with Vienna \u2013 especially given they were falling for one another too. The first evening was spent at Vienna\u2019s historic opera house watching Puccini\u2019s romantic opera \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me.\u201d Max and Carter sat hand-in-hand in the theater, drank red wine in intermission and afterward Max introduced Carter to a Viennese tradition. \u201cThere\u2019s a very famous sausage stand, right next to the Opera House, where you would meet the president after the opera \u2013 because everybody goes there to get a sausage and a piece of bread with mustard, and eat it and have a last sip of beer before they go home after the opera,\u201d says Max. The two also toured the city\u2019s numerous palaces, visited the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Zoo and rode the historic Ferris wheel. For Carter and Max, the time in Vienna was both a whirlwind romantic haze and defined by a feeling of easy, surprising intimacy. \u201cI was really comfortable. When we were in Vienna, he was already ironing my clothes for me,\u201d says Carter. \u201cIt went from zero to 100, really, really quick, in terms of comfort. \u201cHe just took such good care of me and that\u2019s what really impressed me. He watched out for me, he showed me around\u2026\u201d Then, all of a sudden, the week was up and Carter had to fly back to California. Max took Carter to the airport and as they said their goodbyes in the departures area, he was firm that the farewell wasn\u2019t forever: \u201cI\u2019m going to come and see you in California,\u201d he promised. As they hugged goodbye, a feeling of certainty crossed Carter\u2019s mind. \u201cThis is it,\u201d she thought. \u201cAnd either I\u2019m going to have to move here, or he\u2019s going to have to move to America.\u201d Carter boarded her flight, and Max went home alone. Back in his apartment, Max called his mother to fill her in properly on his romantic adventure, enthusing about Carter and their time together. \u201cAnd then I put my phone away and I was sitting there, I was like \u2018Oh, this is weird,\u2019\u201d he says. Max suddenly felt lonely and sad \u2013 and simultaneously, he found himself marveling at that feeling. \u201cYou met this person only a week before \u2013 three and a half weeks before online \u2013 and now she\u2019s not here and it\u2019s horrible,\u201d he thought. Max\u2019s life in Vienna felt empty without Carter. And over the next few weeks, as he wandered around the city, Max realized every corner of the city reminded him of her \u2013 whether he was walking past the sausage stand outside the Opera House, or just spotting the Ferris wheel turning in the city skyline. Back in Sacramento, Carter kept having to remind herself that her visit to Europe wasn\u2019t a dream. It felt like a \u201cfairy tale,\u201d she says. And it was hard to wrap her head around everything that had happened in such a short space of time. As soon as he could, Max booked a flight to visit Carter for later in the fall. Eventually, this visit rolled around. \u201cI went and picked him up from the airport. And I was like, \u2018I cannot believe he\u2019s here. I can\u2019t believe it. Oh my gosh, this is real. He really came. He\u2019s really here,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. A California visit Carter wanted to introduce Max to the best of California in the same way he\u2019d shown her Vienna. So first they stopped off in San Francisco, then the two went to Napa Valley and spent a few days in the wine country. \u201cI took him wine tasting and showed him all over there,\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cIt was really fun.\u201d Carter also introduced Max to her whole family and they all traveled together to the coastal city of Monterey for a few days\u2019 vacation. \u201cIt was great. We just threw him into the fire,\u201d says Carter. \u201cWe had a lot of fun,\u201d says Max. \u201cMonterey is a little nice town on the coast on the way south \u2013 I totally fell in love with that place too.\u201d When Max and Carter said goodbye at the end of Max\u2019s trip, they promised to meet again as soon as they could. And so Carter booked a trip to Vienna for December, which happened to coincide with her birthday. Carter assumed they\u2019d stay in Vienna, wander around the Christmas markets \u2013 but Max had a surprise up his sleeve: \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Paris for your birthday,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. She couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI had always wanted to see Paris,\u201d says Carter. After the Parisian getaway, Carter returned to the US for Christmas. Max joined her, and the two welcomed the New Year together, excited for all 2023 might bring. But while Carter and Max were certain they wanted to be together, the shape of their future was still uncertain. They\u2019d both spent way more money on international flights in 2022 than they\u2019d ever anticipated. It just wasn\u2019t sustainable to travel back and forth so regularly. So Max and Carter waited it out for a few months, and while the nine-hour time difference was difficult to navigate, the couple remained committed to one another from across the Atlantic. Making a decision After a few months apart, in spring 2023 Carter returned to Austria, joining Max on a family vacation to the south of the country. \u201cThat was the first time she met my dad and my brother and his girlfriend and my mom,\u201d says Max. The trip was a bit of a baptism of fire, Max admits. \u201cWe went on this unbelievably long biking trip,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe did so well, I couldn\u2019t believe it, because it was, like, 55 kilometers \u2013 you know, really long \u2013 electric vehicles, up and down the hills \u2013 but with several wine breaks, so that made it a bit easier.\u201d It was during this trip that Carter and Max started talking more seriously about the future, and what it might look like. \u201cI want you here with me,\u201d Max told Carter. \u201cI want you here with me more than anything.\u201d But when the topic of marriage came up, Carter was surprised to realize they were on slightly different pages. All her friends in the US in committed relationships were married. But Max had friends in Austria who\u2019d been with their partners for over a decade and shared several kids, but had no intention of ever signing marriage papers. To Carter, this seemed to be something of a cultural gap \u2013 maybe there was a stronger commitment to the institution of marriage in the US than in Austria? Max even said he never planned to get married. But when Carter explained that marriage was important to her, a crucial symbol of commitment in a relationship, Max understood. He wanted to be with Carter forever, that much was sure. And so Max and Carter confirmed marriage was in their future. Also in their future? Carter leaving California and permanently moving to Vienna. This was a big decision, but Carter had fallen in love with the Austrian capital, and was excited at the idea of a life there. The couple did also consider Max moving to the US, but in the end, Vienna won out. \u201cIt\u2019s always ranked the most livable city in the world,\u201d Carter says, referring to the recent Economist Intelligence Unit list of the world\u2019s most livable cities, which ranked Vienna at number one for the third year in a row.\u00a0\u201cWe just felt quality of life would be a lot better here in Vienna.\u201d As for Max, he suggests moving to the US at some point isn\u2019t off the table. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a very big affiliation with America,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd why should I not take the same thing on my back that Carter did for me, and move over to America? We\u2019ll see. But I think that Vienna is just the perfect place to live, all in all.\u201d In May 2023, Carter moved out of her Sacramento apartment, sold her car and all her furniture, packed a couple of suitcases, and moved across the world to start a new life. Sadly, just as Carter set off for the airport, Max\u2019s grandmother unexpectedly passed away. Carter arrived in Vienna to a grieving Max and a few days later, accompanied him to the funeral. It was a \u201crough start,\u201d admits Max. But he was so pleased to see Carter. For both Max and Carter, being by each other\u2019s side during this tough period reinforced their certainty that they\u2019d made the right decision. \u201cYou want to have your better half at your side when life gets a bit hard,\u201d says Max. \u201cAnd my grandma was really important to me, so I appreciated Carter being there.\u201d Carter didn\u2019t bring much with her to Europe \u2013 she\u2019d sold basically everything, after all. But there was one non-negotiable: her dog, Waffles. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to come without her,\u201d says Carter. Max was almost as excited about Waffles moving in as he was finally living with Carter. \u201cI never had a dog, ever,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I always wanted one. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d Adjusting to life in Vienna was a big change \u2013 for both Waffles and Carter \u2013 but Carter felt supported by Max as she began to accilimatize to Austria. \u201cHe made it very easy for me to come over and start my life here,\u201d she says. A wedding and an anniversary In late August 2023, on the one year anniversary of their first meeting, Carter and Max got married in Austria, in a small city hall wedding attended by immediate family. Carter took Max\u2019s name, becoming Carter Ratzenb\u00f6ck. \u201cWe had a little brunch with our eight guests,\u201d says Max. \u201cAnd then we took off to go right back to Florence.\u201d In Florence, Max and Carter retraced the steps of their first trip together. The couple recreated their first ever photo together \u2013 taken a year previously, on Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio Bridge. And as a nod to that first date, Carter dug out the sparkly headband she\u2019d worn that day, which serendipitously coordinated with her white wedding dress. The couple also took photos in the Uffizi Gallery, kissing in front of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus.\u201d And as they walked around Florence, passersby, spotting that they were newlyweds, started cheering and clapping. Today Max and Carter are fast approaching their first wedding anniversary \u2013 and the two year anniversary of their first meeting. They plan to return to Florence once again to celebrate both occasions. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of making it a thing,\u201d says Carter. \u201cThis will be year three in Florence.\u201d For Carter and Max it\u2019s surreal to think how much their lives have changed since their first meeting just two years ago. Today, Carter admits it was \u201ckind of crazy\u201d to arrange a date with a guy who lived on the other side of the world. And Max appreciates it was \u201cpretty crazy\u201d to fly to Florence to see a woman he met on the internet. The couple are grateful everything worked out \u2013 and appreciate their happy ending was perhaps against the odds. But Carter\u2019s also grateful for their mutual optimistic outlook, which defined their early decisions and still defines their relationship today. \u201cBe optimistic,\u201d she says. \u201cTake a chance \u2013 that\u2019s what I was thinking at the time.\u201d After all, Carter says, if she hadn\u2019t been optimistic about travel, about love, about Max \u2013 her life today would look very different. Carter and Max suggest their story also disproves the notion that falling in love via a dating app is less romantic than stumbling across a stranger the old-fashioned way. \u201cThank goodness for dating apps,\u201d says Carter. \u201cIt allowed us to reach each other. Because I would never have met him otherwise. There\u2019s no way we would have ever ran into each other. Because like we said, he likes to stay in and play video games\u2026 And how cool is it that you get to meet somebody through this app, on the other side of the world and see what those people are like? I just think online dating opens up so many more possibilities.\u201d \u201cI think our story is the perfect example that the impossible is out there,\u201d adds Max. \u201cAll those parts\u2026 with meeting online, one in the heart of Europe, one on the west coast in America, one completely involved in his life and one in her life traveling\u2026 All those puzzle pieces are perfect for a novel, but not for real life, at least that\u2019s what most people think. But that\u2019s not true. We are the best example. And we\u2019re very happy that it happened that way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stranger-invite-vacation-italy-chance-encounter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

The report from the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) confirmed the authenticity of a June 30 video statement by 16 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) leaders announcing they were dissolving the extremist network. In the statement, captured on video and shared online, the leaders confirmed their commitment to the Indonesian state and law, and said all material taught in JI-affiliated boarding schools would be in line with orthodox Islam. \u201cIt is too early to say what the consequences are, but the men who signed the statement have enough respect and credibility within the organisation to ensure widespread acceptance,\u201d said Sidney Jones, who authored IPAC\u2019s preliminary analysis. The Al-Qaeda-linked militant group is accused of orchestrating some of the deadliest attacks in Indonesia, including the 2002 bombing of Bali nightclubs that killed more than 200 people. Indonesia\u2019s National Counter Terrorism Agency (BNPT) declined to comment on the development, but said it planned to hold a press conference soon. The decision to disband the organization, said Jones, was likely driven by several factors, including the influence of intellectuals within JI who were less interested in violent jihad, and a cost-benefit analysis on the best way to protect the group\u2019s biggest assets \u2013 its schools. Intensive engagement with counter-terrorism officials also played a role, the report said. Despite the clout of the figures involved, IPAC noted the group has a history of splinters and it was possible one could emerge in the future, although probably not immediately. \u201cFor the moment, the likely result is the flourishing of JI-affiliated schools and the increasing involvement in public life of the men who signed the 30 June statement,\u201d said IPAC. \u201cWhat happens to the rest of the membership remains to be seen.\u201d Adhe Bhakti, a terrorism expert at the Jakarta-based Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, said he doubted the group\u2019s splinter factions would follow their seniors. He said these groups could become threats because they will feel they need \u201cto do something violently,\u201d although he did not believe this will happen in the near future. \u201cThe splinters have in fact become wild at this vulnerable point,\u201d Adhe said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/asia/jemaah-islamiyah-militant-group-disbanded-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_ukraine-russia-chasiv-yar-part-seized-intl", "text": "Russian troops have taken control of parts of a key hilltop town in eastern Ukraine, a strategic gain that could pose major problems for Ukrainian troops trying to defend the area from further advances. The relatively small town of Chasiv Yar has played an outsized role in the conflict and has been battered by months of intense fighting. Sitting on high ground, it is seen as a gateway to the parts of the Donetsk region that are still in Ukrainian hands. The town overlooks the lower-laying areas to the north, towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and to the west towards Dnipropetrovsk\u00a0region. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Thursday that its troops have taken over the easternmost district of Chasiv Yar. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military said that Kyiv forces retreated from the district after their defensive positions were destroyed and it became clear that efforts to hold onto the neighborhood were becoming \u201cinexpedient\u201d because of the risk to the defending troops. \u201cOver the last day, 238 attacks from all types of weapons were recorded in the Chasiv Yar area,\u201d Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s \u201cKhortytsia\u201d operational and strategic grouping, told a Ukrainian national television channel. At the same time, Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said Russian forces were reportedly moving towards a strategically important road that connects Bakhmut, which has been in Russian hands for more than a year, with Konstantinivka and Pokrovsk. The road is a key supply line for the Ukrainian military. The withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from parts of Chasiv Yar is a troubling development for Kyiv as it focuses on stabilizing the frontlines following months of relentless Russian assaults. Moscow took advantage of the acute shortages of ammunition experienced by Kyiv due to delays in Western military aid in the first half of this year, trying to pierce Ukraine\u2019s defensive lines alongside the eastern frontline. It even launched a surprise cross-border offensive in northern Ukraine in order to force Kyiv to pull some troops away from the east. But the situation was starting to look better for Ukraine in recent weeks after Western weapons finally started arriving on the frontlines. A possible major Russian offensive towards Kharkiv, the second-largest Ukrainian city, was averted and the eastern front appeared more stable. Higher ground Ukraine has insisted that it is still firmly in control of the western parts of Chasiv Yar and that the withdrawal from the eastern part was a tactical decision. DeepState, the monitoring group, said the district \u201chas been completely wiped out\u201d and \u201cholding it in ruins\u201d would only increase losses. \u201cLeaving the neighborhood is a logical, albeit a difficult decision,\u201d it said. The town had a pre-war population of about 12,000, but has been mostly deserted for months. Vadym Filashkin, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, said in May that some 679 civilians were still in Chasiv Yar, refusing to evacuate their homes. \u201cCapturing Chasiv Yar would allow the Russians to bring in more (First Person View) drones, drone operators and artillery into the area, and it would give them an advantageous position to conduct ground strikes and drone strikes on Ukrainian troops,\u201d Konrad Muzyka, a defense analyst who has been tracking the conflict closely, told CNN in an interview. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no secret of the fact that he wants his forces to control the whole of Donestk. The region was dissected in half when the war broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern parts of the region. While Russia took control of a other parts of Donetsk following the launch of its full-scale invasion in February 2022, it never managed to occupy the whole of the region. If Chasiv Yar was to fall to Russian hands, it could put bigger cities to the west at risk. \u201cChasiv Yar the largest settlement on the way to Kramatorsk, so if Russians were to capture it, then the Ukrainians would not necessarily have the chances to rely on urban settlements to decrease the tempo of Russian attacks,\u201d Muzyka said. Advancing through an urban environment is much more difficult compared to open terrain. Chasiv Yar itself has been the epicenter of the fight for months. Bakhmut, which sits about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of Chasiv Yar, fell to Russia at a huge cost to its troops in May 2023, after many months of intense fighting. By the time Moscow claimed control over the city, it was almost completely destroyed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/ukraine-russia-chasiv-yar-part-seized-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Muhammed Neamah Naser, a commander in Hezbollah\u2019s Aziz Unit, was \u201celiminated\u201d on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, blaming him for directing terror attacks both before and after Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks from Gaza The IDF described him as a counterpart of Sami Taleb Abdullah, another Hezbollah commander whose killing last month also triggered a wave of retaliatory strikes. \u201cTogether, they served as two of the most significant\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0terrorists in southern Lebanon,\u201d the IDF said. In response to the killing, Hezbollah on Thursday said it had launched \u201cmore than 200 missiles of various types\u201d at Israeli targets. The Israeli military said that it intercepted some of those Hezbollah missiles, as well as drones. Some fires broke out as a result of falling shrapnel. In response to those strikes, the IDF said their\u00a0fighter jets have struck Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon\u00a0overnight Wednesday into Thursday. The\u00a0IDF said they struck a\u00a0military structure and three\u00a0\u201cterrorist infrastructure sites.\u201d Hezbollah said Thursday that one of its fighters had been killed. Naser is the latest Hezbollah commander to be killed in hostilities that flared along the Israel-Lebanon border since the October 7 attacks. Israeli fire services said Thursday that they are working on multiple \u201cextensive fires\u201d in the north of the country \u201cas a result of the heavy shelling from\u00a0Lebanon.\u201d More than 10 fires broke out in the area of the Upper Galilee and the Golan Heights, the Israel Fire and Rescue North District said in a statement,\u00a0\u201cwith some of them creating very extensive fires in challenging terrain.\u201d Over 40 firefighting teams and 10 aircraft were working in the region on five major incidents, the statement said. Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began. But it has been gradually intensifying, raising fears it could escalate into a full-blown conflict. Hezbollah is one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, boasting of tens of thousands of fighters and a vast missile arsenal. The group has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 300\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0fighters and some 90 civilians, according to Reuters tallies. Meanwhile, Israel says fire from Lebanon has killed 18 soldiers and 10 civilians. Eugenia Yosef\u00a0contributed to this report.

Robert Woodland was found guilty of attempted trafficking of large amounts of illegal drugs as part of an organized group, the Ostankino District Court of Moscow said. Woodland\u2019s lawyers told reporters after the verdict was delivered that they would appeal the ruling as Woodland\u2019s guilt had not been proven, the Associated Press (AP) reported. Woodland has been suffering from unspecified mental health issues, his lawyer Stanislav Kshevitsky told AP without providing any details. He added that the court didn\u2019t take those issues into account. CNN is reaching out to his lawyers for comment. Moscow\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office\u00a0said that on January 3, Woodland was caught trying to hide a \u201clarge batch\u201d of mephedrone after he had transported the synthetic stimulant to an apartment in Moscow. Prosecutors said he had used the apartment to bag the drugs in 49 smaller packages for further illegal sale. Woodland is a US citizen of Russian origin who was adopted by US scientists and he returned to Russia 27 years later. He was born on December 7, 1991, and his real name is Roman Romanov. He comes from the Perm Krai region, far from Moscow and just West of the Ural mountains. The pro-Kremlin tabloid Komosomolskaya Pravda reported in 2020 that Woodland was two years old when he was brought to the US. Woodland is one of at least a dozen US citizens and dual nationals currently being detained in Russia, including Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in\u00a0Russia\u00a0since the Cold War. Gershkovich\u2019s espionage trial began in late June, nearly 15 months after he was first detained. Western officials and analysts have accused Russia of using jailed Americans as political pawns.

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_french-elections-political-violence-intl-latam", "text": "French authorities have recorded more than 50 physical assaults on candidates and campaigners on the campaign trail, the country\u2019s Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said Friday as concerns mount about political violence ahead of\u00a0France\u2019s high-stakes parliamentary elections. \u201cThis campaign is short, less than three weeks. However, we have counted 51 candidates, deputies, or campaigners who have been physically assaulted. I am not counting verbal aggressions here,\u201d Darmanin told CNN affiliate BFMTV. The attacks have ranged from the less severe to \u201cextremely serious,\u201d Darmanin said, adding that some candidates have been hospitalised for their injuries. Roughly thirty or so people have been taken in for questioning in relation to the attacks, Darmanin added. France has been grappling with high tensions in the run-up to this Sunday\u2019s elections. An additional 30,000 police have been laid on to ensure that neither the far-left nor the far-right succeed in \u201ccreating disorder,\u201d Darmanin said earlier this week. Politicians have\u00a0repeatedly warned that a far-right victory\u00a0could provoke huge protests in the streets, with French President Emmanuel Macron going so far as to say \u201ccivil war\u201d may break out if the extreme left or right wins by a large margin in Sunday\u2019s runoff vote. French government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot and her team came under attack while canvassing on Wednesday night. Meanwhile, National Rally (RN) politician Marie Dauchy, who is running in the southeastern constituency of Savoie, opted to suspend her campaign after she said was physically assaulted while campaigning at a market. In Cherbourg, a center-right candidate from The Republicans party, Nicolas Conquer, made a formal complaint after he claimed he was assaulted by left-wing campaigners on Monday. The terror threat in the country \u201cremains extremely strong,\u201d the interior minister warned on Friday, adding that several arrests had recently taken place in two separate places. Although the two incidents \u201ccould qualify as terrorist\u201d incidents, they need to be formally classified as such by the national anti-terrorist prosecutor, Darmanin added.

{"id": "2024_05_23_uk_uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl", "text": "Voters in Britain are primed to end a 14-year era of Conservative rule, in a momentous general election that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is almost universally expected to lose. Sunak took the biggest gamble of his troubled premiership by calling the early vote, but he has struggled to turn around dire polling and appears on the cusp of defeat. If, as current polls indicate, the opposition Labour party triumph, it will finally bring down the curtain of a 14-year era of Conservative rule, ushering in a center-left government led by former barrister Keir Starmer. Any other outcome would mean Sunak has orchestrated a shocking victory that even many in his own party believe is beyond reach \u2013 and would result in the Conservatives extending a political dynasty towards a third decade. Here are some key questions answered. When and how is Britain voting? After a weeks-long campaign, polls will open at 7 a.m. local time on Thursday (2 a.m. ET), and they\u2019ll stay open until 10 p.m. Britons can cast a ballot in each of the country\u2019s 650 constituencies, selecting the MP to represent the area. The leader of the party that wins a majority of those constituencies becomes prime minister, and can form a government. That means 326 is the magic number for an overall majority. If there\u2019s no majority, they need to look for help elsewhere, ruling as a minority government \u2013 as Theresa May did after a close 2017 result \u2013 or forming a coalition, as David Cameron did after 2010. The monarch has an important, albeit symbolic, role; King Charles III must approve the formation of a government, the decision to hold an election and the dissolution of parliament. The King won\u2019t ever contradict his prime minister or overrule the results of an election. Why did Sunak call an election? Sunak was required to call a vote by January 2025, but the decision of when to do so was his alone. His problem was that no good options existed. He was 20 points behind in the polls, and that deficit hadn\u2019t budged for months. Some in his ear urged him to wait until later in the year, when poor economic news could improve. But on the other hand, Sunak has placed much of his political capital into his pledge to stop small boat crossings to the UK by asylum seekers. He has recently passed a controversial law to process some claims in Rwanda, though nobody has yet been deported and further legal challenges may await the plan. The warmer summer months are expected to see a huge number of such journeys across the English Channel, hurting a major pillar of his campaign message. Ultimately, hours after some rare good economic news \u2013 a healthy month-on-month reduction in the rate of inflation \u2013 Sunak decided that this was the least bad time to pull the trigger. But his speech, which took place in a downpour outside Downing Street, set the tone for a miserable campaign. Who\u2019s expected to win? The near-universal expectation is that Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party will lose the election. Labour have been leading in general election opinion polls since late 2021, and that lead has been huge throughout the campaign. They are around 20 points up on average, with the Tories closer to third party challengers Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a Labour win so huge it would spell a near-wipeout for the Conservatives. The Conservative brand was damaged by Partygate and a number of other scandals that led to the demise of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, and then the shambolic six-week tenure of his successor Liz Truss, whose fiscal agenda sent markets into turmoil. Sunak\u2019s campaign has even shifted its message in recent weeks, encouraging supporters instead to prevent a massive Labour majority than to send Sunak back to Downing Street. It\u2019s essentially an admission of defeat, and underlines what polling has said for some time: Labour is firmly on course for victory. But the Labour party is concerned about people taking the result for granted, and have stressed in recent days that nothing is decided until the votes are counted. How has the campaign gone? Starmer and Sunak have faced off in two head-to-head TV debates, which were at times ill-tempered and featured contentious claims \u2013 particularly an assertion by Sunak that Labour would cost Britons thousands in new taxes, which Labour have ruled out. Labour\u2019s campaign has been otherwise focused, hammering home a promise of \u201cchange\u201d while pledging prudence with the nation\u2019s finances. Sunak has meanwhile struggled to stay on track; in particular a decision to leave D-Day anniversary commemorations early caused fury back home and prompted an apology. Two head-to-head TV debates have been organized; in the first, Sunak and Starmer scrapped in a tense and occasionally personal tie. The second will air in late June. Then on Thursday, July 4, Britons will vote between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, and as soon as polls close, votes will be counted. A winner is usually declared in the early hours of Friday morning. Who is Keir Starmer? Rishi Sunak\u2019s rival for power is Labour leader Keir Starmer, who is heavily favored to become Britain\u2019s new prime minister in July. A former, well-respected human rights lawyer who then served as Britain\u2019s most senior prosecutor, Starmer came into politics late in life. He became a Labour MP in 2015 and less than five years later was the party\u2019s leader, following a stint as shadow Brexit Secretary during Britain\u2019s protracted exit from the European Union. Starmer inherited a party reeling from its worst electoral defeat in generations, but he prioritized an overhaul of its culture \u2013 staring down left-wing supporters of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, and apologizing publicly for a long-running antisemitism scandal that had tainted the group\u2019s standing with the public. He has attempted to lay claim to Britain\u2019s political center ground, and is described by his supporters as a principled, serious leader with a focus on tackling the systemic issues facing Britain. But his opponents, on both the left of his own party and the right of the political spectrum, say he lacks charisma and ideas, and charge that he has failed to set out an ambitious and broad vision for the nation. Who else is standing? Only Sunak or Starmer have a realistic chance of becoming prime minister, but their plans could be disrupted by a number of smaller parties. Nigel Farage, the populist right-wing figurehead who leads Reform UK, announced he would stand for election early in the campaign \u2013 he previously declined to do so, in order to help former President Donald Trump campaign in the US election this fall \u2013 and his entry has helped the group peel away Tory support. Farage has criticized Sunak\u2019s record on migration, and his group has pulled close to the Tories in many polls. Holding on to that level of support come election day could cause a once-in-a-lifetime decimation of the Tories at the ballot box. Meanwhile, as Farage attacks Sunak from the right, the Liberal Democrats, a centrist, pro-European group, have chipped away at Conservative support in affluent, southern parts of England. Given Labour\u2019s standing in the polls, Starmer is more equipped to take the fight to other groups. North of the border, he will look to end the Scottish National Party (SNP)\u2019s generation-long dominance at the ballot box, capitalizing on a rocky period in the party\u2019s recent history that has seen them replace two leaders in just over a year. But he will need to be mindful of the Green Party, which has challenged him from the left and has attracted some younger liberal votes as a result. In recent local elections, there was evidence too that Labour\u2019s stance on Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza had harmed the party in majority-Muslim areas. What issues will decide the election? The answer to that question will go some way in deciding the night\u2019s winner. Labour has been dogged in trying to define the election as a referendum on 14 years of Conservative rule, seizing on public fatigue with a party that has produced five prime ministers in that span and overseen Brexit, a stuttering economy and a series of sleaze scandals. In particular, Starmer has spoken plenty about the cost of living hitting British families, and the state of the country\u2019s overstaffed and stretched National Health Service (NHS). Sunak, by contrast, has tried to focus on migration \u2013 his pledge to \u201cStop the Boats\u201d hasn\u2019t yet worked, but his flagship Rwanda policy has at least become law. And he has attempted to convince voters that the economy has turned a corner, and can\u2019t risk a change in governance. When will we know the results? Once polls open on Thursday, the media in Britain is barred from discussing anything that could affect voting. But the second voting stops, an exit poll will drop that sets the course for the night. The poll, done by Ipsos for the BBC, ITV and Sky, projects the seat breakdown of the new parliament, and it\u2019s historically been very accurate. The real results are counted throughout the night; the shape of the evening is usually clear by about 3 a.m. local time (10 p.m. ET on Thursday), and the new prime minister \u2013 if there is one \u2013 is often in post by noon. But things can take longer if the result is close, or if key seats go down to the wire. Either way, the infamously sudden handover in power will take place by the weekend, leaving the new government a few weeks to work on key legislation before parliament breaks for the summer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/uk/uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_middleeast_idf-former-spokesman-blames-government-war-intl", "text": "A former spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces has sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s conduct of the war against Hamas, in the latest sign of growing tensions between the military and the government. Lt Col. Peter Lerner said that while speaking with the world\u2019s media on behalf of the military, he came to realize the \u201closs of international trust in Israel and the government\u2019s failure to maintain widespread support for the war against Hamas over time.\u201d\u00a0Lerner served in the IDF for more than 25 years \u2013 most recently as a spokesman during the war, before stepping down last month. Lerner was speaking in an extended interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. \u201cNetanyahu promised a complete victory over Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the international arena he and his government led us to defeat.\u201d Lerner told Haaretz that in the early days of the conflict, following Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on October 7, \u201cThere was a clear understanding that Hamas is an evil and dangerous organization, and that Israel must act against it.\u201d That goodwill quickly eroded, he said, partly because of the inevitable suffering of Palestinian civilians as the IDF began the ground invasion of Gaza. But he also blamed the government, saying \u201cthere is no political strategy for the war, even after nine months in which we are fighting on two fronts.\u201d Lerner said that as he was increasingly asked about the goals of the operation, \u201cI quickly realized that I had no answers to these questions, not because they haven\u2019t been decided yet, but because they simply aren\u2019t going to be decided.\u201d He said he felt like \u201ca soldier who goes to guard without cartridges\u2026 I don\u2019t have the ammunition I need to deal with the interviewers\u2019 questions. I just had to say that I am speaking on behalf of the army, and that these questions are the responsibility of the government. But the government also had no answers, because it was politically inconvenient.\u201d Lerner was also critical of ministers who \u2013 he maintained \u2013 had reduced the legitimacy of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. \u201cHamas damaged almost all the power lines that connect Gaza to Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had the opportunity to come and say: Hamas is harming the citizens of Gaza, and we, Israel, will try to fix it, but only if he stops the shooting. Instead, the Minister of Energy at the time, Israel Katz, comes out with populist statements about the fact that he will cut them off from electricity and will not deliver fuel to them either.\u201d Lerner quoted a remark by Netanyahu in 2016 that the test in the field of propaganda is very simple: Were your hands tied when you wanted to defend yourself? He said the Prime Minister had failed that test \u201cmiserably. The US and the UK are cancelling arm s shipments, France forbids us to participate in a large arms exhibition. We delayed for months the entrance to Rafah. This issue requires a state inquiry commission, just like the failures of October 7.\u201d Lerner\u2019s remarks follow multiple accounts of tensions between Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s military leadership. Last week, Netanyahu rejected the idea of starting a ceasefire in Gaza while Hamas remains in power, after the New York Times published an article\u00a0citing six current and former security officials who said a truce would give Israeli troops time to prepare for a potential land war with Hezbollah. The officials, most of whom spoke anonymously to \u201cdiscuss sensitive security matters,\u201d also said a truce would be the most effective way to secure the release of the Israeli hostages. Former Israeli National Security Advisor Eyal Hulata, who according to the Times maintains regular communication with \u201csenior miliary officials,\u201d spoke on the record, saying, \u201cthe military is in full support of a hostage deal and a cease-fire\u2026 they believe that they can always go back and engage Hamas militarily in the future.\u201d In a statement, Netanyahu said, \u201cI do not know who these anonymous sources are, but I am here to make it unequivocally clear: This will not happen. The war will end once Israel achieves all of its objectives, including the destruction of Hamas and the release of all of our hostages.\u201d That report came days after Israel\u2019s\u00a0top military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Hamas could not be destroyed, and that anyone who claimed otherwise was \u201cthrowing sand in the eyes of the public\u201d \u2013 an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, who has repeatedly pledged to eliminate the group.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/middleeast/idf-former-spokesman-blames-government-war-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

{"id": "2024_07_04_middleeast_iran-presidential-election-round-two-pezeshkian-jalili-intl", "text": "Iran\u2019s snap presidential election will head to a second vote on Friday, with a reformist and conservative hardliner facing off to replace Ebrahim Raisi amid unprecedented voter apathy. After none of the four initial candidates secured more than 50% of the vote on June 28, reformist lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili emerged as the two candidates with the most votes, with Pezeshkian leading by 3.9 percentage points. The first round, however, saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979, highlighting the discontent among a population losing faith in the country\u2019s ruling clerical establishment. Pezeshkian and Jalili are on opposite ends of the Iranian political spectrum. Each candidate could lead Iran in a starkly different manner at a time when the Islamic Republic is grappling with delicate domestic and international problems \u2013 including an economy in tatters, a restive youth movement and escalating tensions with Israel and the United States. Here\u2019s what to expect on Friday\u2019 second round of elections, and how the results could impact Iran and the world. What happened in the first round? The snap election was held after Raisi died in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the country\u2019s remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials. Three conservatives and a single reformist candidate vied  for the country\u2019s top elected seat, after dozens of other candidates were barred from standing by the powerful 12-member Guardian Council, which is tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, and reports directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. During the first round, Pezeshkian led with 42.5% of the votes, followed by Jalili with 38.6%, according to the state news agency IRNA. Out of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40% turnout. The record low turnout \u2013 in a country where presidential elections usually command more than 60% \u2013\u00a0came despite Khamenei urging Iranians to show \u201cmaximum participation\u201d in order to strengthen the Islamic Republic against its adversaries. Iranians who spoke to CNN in Tehran ahead of the first vote expressed little faith in the those running, especially as candidates are vetted by the Guardian Council. The turnout suggests that \u201cthis anger and disillusionment with the regime as a whole is really not limited to the reformists,\u201d Trita Parsi, a Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, told CNN. \u201cEven amongst conservatives there seems to be a lot of anger and disillusionment with the system, because their participation was very low as well.\u201d Nevertheless, analysts say critical shifts may be taking place among voters ahead of the second round. Some conservatives \u2013 including those who in the first round supported hardliner Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf \u00a0\u2013 appear to be moving their support to the reformist Pezeshkian at the expense of his conservative opponent Jalili. Is the conservative camp fracturing? \u201cYou\u2019ve clearly have had a split amongst the conservatives,\u201d Parsi told CNN, including within the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in which Jalili previously served. Analysts suggest that some conservatives believe it\u2019s necessary to shift away from some of the uncompromising policies of the late President Raisi, which Jalili is likely to continue. One of those conservatives is Sardar Mohsen Rashid, a founder and senior member of the IRGC. Rashid declared his support for Pezeshkian on Monday and called on people to defend him against \u201ccowardly attacks,\u201d according to the conservative Iranian news site Khabar Online. In a move that shocked observers, the man who led Ghalibaf\u2019s electoral campaign, Sami Nazari Tarkarani, also declared his support for reformist Pezeshkian, Khabar Online reported. While it is unclear whether that shift while be reflected on the ground, other supporters of Ghalibaf said they are trying to sway conservatives and silent voters to\u00a0also back the reformist candidate instead. The splits among conservatives also show that sentiments within camps are not homogenous, analysts said. \u201cThe type of anti-establishment sentiments are not limited to just the reformists, you also have it in the ranks of the IRGC,\u201d Parsi said, adding that the current rifts are particularly notable given efforts by the regime to concentrate power only in the hands of the conservatives. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, said that Iranian politics is factional and divided, adding that \u201cnot everyone in the IRGC supports or favors conservative or hardline politics.\u201d What would a win for Pezeshkian mean? In a presidential debate on Monday, both candidates appeared intent on garnering votes from the 60% of the electorate that did not participate, experts said. \u201cPezeshkian is adopting more radical rhetoric to attract nonvoters,\u201d Sina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC, wrote on X. \u201cMeanwhile, Jalili is trying to soften his image, and has agreed with Pezeshkian numerous times.\u201d Pezeshkian, who comes from an Azeri-Kurdish family, has tried to appeal to minorities, women and the country\u2019s youth, Toossi wrote. The establishment appoints people from its \u201cown circles and excludes the rest of the population,\u201d the candidate said during the debate on Monday. Pezeshkian had famously criticized the regime\u2019s handling of the 2022 mass protests, saying that in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d Addressing poverty in Iran, he said during the debate that \u201cthe problem of the poor is us,\u201d adding that if candidates want to increase voter turnout, \u201cthey (the voters) must believe that officials sit at the same table as they do.\u201d Millions in Iran are under the poverty line, often struggling to make ends meet in an economy that has for years been crippled by US sanctions. Iran\u2019s annual inflation rate hasn\u2019t dipped below 30% in over five years, and in June stood at 36.1%, straining wallets across the country. This persistent inflation follows the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement and the subsequent reimposition of heavy sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian stressed the need to re-start dialogue with the West and find a way to end the sanctions. Iran\u2019s relationship with the West has only worsened in recent months, with Tehran supporting militant groups across the Middle East that have targeted both Israeli and US interests amid the war in Gaza. The Islamic Republic has also escalated its nuclear program, pulling back cooperation with the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. What would a Jalili win mean? During the presidential debates, Jalili also sought to appeal to women and youth, saying that voices of students and young Iranians \u201cmust be heard.\u201d However, he stuck to his position that Iran should not rely on the West to ensure progress, a line echoed by the Supreme Leader in recent weeks. \u201cWe must make the enemy regret imposing sanctions,\u201d Jalili said, adding that Western threats must be turned into an opportunity, a line echoed by late President Raisi, who sought to solidify friendships with US foes\u00a0amid Western isolation. The candidates\u2019 opposing views come as rhetoric between Iran and Israel sharpens. The two countries exchanged direct fire for the first time in April as the Gaza conflict widened, and Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Iran\u2019s mission to the UN said on Saturday that should Israel \u201cembark on full-scale military aggression\u201d against Lebanon, then \u201can obliterating war will ensue.\u201d \u201cAll options, including the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table,\u201d it said on X. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded on Saturday, saying that \u201ca regime that threatens destruction deserves to be destroyed.\u201d How much autonomy would either candidate really have? The heated regional tensions raise questions about whether a reformist president can truly make a difference. Experts say it may not be as big of a chance as some in the West might hope. The Supreme Leader is the final arbiter on most decisions in Iran. But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that the president and his foreign policy team are irrelevant,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said. The president and his cabinet implement foreign policy, and have a lot of influence on the diplomatic apparatus of the country, Vaez told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson in an interview on Monday. He noted that Pezeshkian\u2019s presidency would be very different from Jalili\u2019s as the reformist is surrounded by the \u201ccreme de la creme of Iranian diplomats.\u201d Iran\u2019s track record, however, shows that it has tended to take a more conservative trajectory in the long run, even when there has been a reformist president in place, experts said, adding that Tehran\u2019s regional policy toward Israel and its proxies is unlikely to change. When it comes to core policies in Iran, such as support for Hezbollah and animosity toward Israel, a reformist president is unlikely to make a difference, Parsi said, adding that there may however be better engagement with the West. Despite that, Jalili may bring more hardline policies to the table, and potentially double down on his predecessor\u2019s approach. Depending on the environment in the West, Jalili may take a \u201cmuch more confrontational approach to Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d Vakil said, adding that despite the limitations on the president\u2019s freedom to act, each brings their \u201cown personal touch\u201d to Iran\u2019s government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/middleeast/iran-presidential-election-round-two-pezeshkian-jalili-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Over 200 candidates from President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist camp and the left-wing alliance have stepped down in a bid to avoid splitting the vote. They\u2019ve put aside their differences with one goal in mind: to keep the far right firmly away from the 289 seats required for an absolute majority currently within their reach. Last Sunday the French people placed the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) and its allies in first place while Macron\u2019s centrist camp came third, behind the left-wing bloc. After the first round in constituencies where no candidate won outright, an unprecedented number of seats \u2013 over 300 - went to a three-way run-off favoring the RN. By Tuesday, as the deadline to drop out closed, fewer than 100 remain, after centrist and left-wing candidates strategically dropped out in individual seats. This tactic could stop some RN candidates from winning, according to analyst Antoine Bristielle. \u201cThe main probability was an absolute majority for the National Rally, but now with all of the withdrawals, I think that\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Bristielle said. In an attempt to deny the RN a majority, the NFP \u2013 a left-wing coalition that wants to lower the retirement age and tax the rich \u2013 promised to withdraw all of its candidates who came in third place in the first round. Leslie Mortreux, an NFP qualifier and the only publicly out transgender runner, stepped aside to give right-wing Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin a better chance of defeating the RN rival in a constituency in the north. Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies also called on their supporters to prevent the far right taking office, but some warned against lending their votes to the hard-left France Unbowed, a party inside the NFP. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire drew the ire of the left on Tuesday when he said no vote should go to the far right but added that he personally would not vote for the far left either. In one constituency in the south, a government minister initially refused to help an NFP candidate, reasoning that she didn\u2019t want her voters to have to choose between two extremes. The following day she tweeted that she was bowing out following pressure from the president and prime minister. In over 80 three-way races, Macron\u2019s centrist candidates dropped out in favor of candidates from the left-wing NFP. But many stopped short of encouraging their supporters to vote for a left-wing opponent. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the difficult decision to withdraw \u2026 leaving it up to my voters to position themselves against the far right or far left,\u201d Samuel Deguara, a candidate from Macron\u2019s camp said after withdrawing. Meanwhile, far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen condemned the political bargaining. \u201cThe act of withdrawing and giving voting instructions shows the worst contempt for voters,\u201d Le Pen said Tuesday. Even before the candidate withdrawals, projections had suggested that after the second round of voting next Sunday, the RN was likely to fall short of an absolute majority and win between 230 and 280 seats in the 577-seat lower house. In speeches before the first round, National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said he would refuse to govern a minority government, in which the RN would require the votes of allies to pass laws. If the RN falls short of an absolute majority and Bardella stays true to his word, Macron might then have to search for a prime minister on the left, or somewhere else entirely. And if the unthinkable for Macron happens and the RN does get an absolute majority, then it will become the first far-right party to enter the French government since World War II.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/europe/french-election-drop-outs-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_asia_japan-us-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The US military will send dozens of its newest fighter jets to Japan as part of a $10 billion upgrade of its forces in the country, the Defense Department announced Wednesday. In a news release, the Pentagon said the effort would be carried out \u201cover the next several years\u201d to \u201cenhance the US-Japan Alliance, bolster regional deterrence, and strengthen peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\u201d The modernization plan will see 48 fifth-generation F-35A fighters replace 36 F-16s at Misawa Air Base in northern Japan, and 36 brand-new F-15EX jets deploy to Kadena Air Base on the southern island of Okinawa, replacing 48 older F-15C/D models that have been pulled from the region in the past year, the Pentagon release said. At Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, just south of Hiroshima on the main island of Honshu, the number of deployed F-35B aircraft will be modified, the Pentagon said, without giving specific numbers. \u201cThe Department\u2019s plan to station the Joint Force\u2019s most advanced tactical aircraft in Japan demonstrates the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan and both countries\u2019 shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\u201d the news release said. Japan said basing the new fighter aircraft in the country would enhance US capabilities there. \u201cIn the face of the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II, and amidst the increased military activities of neighboring countries, the United States is maintaining and strengthening the presence of U.S. forces in Japan to further enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, the government\u2019s top spokesman, said at a regular briefing Thursday. Japan\u2019s alliance with the US has become increasingly important in a region that is seeing China, Russia and North Korea all pose threats that Tokyo seeks to counter. Japan has festering territorial disputes in the north with Russia and with China over islands in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, North Korea\u2019s growing missile program, which has seen Pyongyang send missiles over Japanese territory in recent years, draws condemnation from Tokyo with every projectile test. Japan also keeps a wary eye on the situation surrounding Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that the Chinese Communist Party has vowed to bring under Beijing\u2019s control, by force if necessary. As much as 90% of Japan\u2019s energy supplies come via sea lanes near Taiwan, according to Tokyo, which sees the status quo around the island as key to its security. Okinawa is only about 450 miles (725 kilometers) from Taiwan, and both the US and Japan maintain key air bases on the island. US air power in Japan The US Air Force calls the Kadena Air Base, home of the 18th Wing, its \u201cKeystone of the Pacific,\u201d and for more than four decades the older model F-15s based there were central to US deterrence in the region. But from 2022, as the twin-engine fighters neared the end of their service life, the US Air Force began pulling them from Kadena. While the service has rotated other assets through the air base since, to cover the absence of the older F-15s, the permanent presence of the F-15EXs will bring stability to the force structure. The F-15EX is a leap above the older models. Manufacturer Boeing says the jet has \u201cunparalleled weapons capacity,\u201d with an ability to carry 12 advanced medium-range, air-to-air missiles (AMRAAM) and\u00a0to fire them from a range \u201cfarther than any other fighter in the US Air Force arsenal.\u201d Although not a stealth fighter like the F-35, Boeing says the F-15EX has next-generation survivability. \u201cIt serves as a long-range standoff weapons system that is also capable of penetrating and surviving in highly contested environments,\u201d the company says on its website. Military aviation analyst Peter Layton said the F-15EXs would be a worry for China in the event of any conflict. The jet can be fitted with stealthy long-range cruise missiles with a range of more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) that could strike inside the Chinese mainland, he said. Newer missiles under development could double that distance, he added. \u201cThat will hold at risk even more Chinese mainland military bases and offer a very quick attack option,\u201d Layton said. The F-15EX is the Air Force\u2019s newest fighter jet, with the first operational plane delivered to the Oregon Air National Guard in early June. The F-35As that will be stationed at Misawa Air Base are the Air Force\u2019s newest stealth fighters. They\u2019ve long been designated as the replacement for F-16s in the USAF inventory. F-35s deliver \u201can enhanced capability to survive in the advanced threat environment in which it was designed to operate,\u201d an Air Force fact sheet says. Layton said the F-15EXs and F-35As complement each other well in a combat scenario. \u201cThe F-35 is an excellent low-observable sensor platform that could operate forward in stealth mode relaying data back to patrolling F-15EXs with their supersonic cruise and large air-to-air missile load outs,\u201d said Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. The aircraft deployments add to other improvements Washington has been making to its force structure in Japan, where the US has more than 50,000 troops. Okinawa houses more than 25,000 US military personnel and more than two dozen military installations. Roughly 70% of the US military bases in Japan are on Okinawa. The US and Japan announced last year that a newly redesignated Marine unit with advanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and the ability to fire anti-ship missiles would be based in Japan.

{"id": "2024_06_23_europe_keir-starmer-labour-prime-minister-profile-intl-cmd", "text": "Four-and-a-half years ago, Britain\u2019s Labour Party suffered its worst election defeat since 1935. The historic election victory of Boris Johnson in 2019 \u2013 which allowed him to finally implement Brexit \u2013 was supposed to mark another 10 years of Conservative rule in Britain, with Labour resigned to rebuild on the fringes of politics. Then Labour leader, the hard-left Jeremy Corbyn, was forced to resign and reluctantly hand his party to the centrist Keir Starmer, a former lawyer, knight of the realm and exactly the type of establishment figure that Corbyn and the far-left despise. In little over four years, Starmer has pulled off a once-impossible coup and dragged his Labour Party from the margins of British politics to a thumping victory in Thursday\u2019s general election. It will be the first time Labour has been in power since 2010 and the first time it has entered power from opposition since Tony Blair\u2019s historic win in 1997. Addressing the nation before entering 10 Downing Street Friday afternoon, Starmer pledged a return to the politics of public service, vowing to heal the \u201cweariness at the heart of the nation\u201d with \u201caction not words.\u201d It was clear going into this election campaign that Britain was screaming out for change after 14 years of Conservative rule that saw cuts in public spending, stretched public services, the chaos of Brexit, a cost-of-living crisis and a sitting prime minister fined by police while in office for the first time in history. Starmer, who had led the opinion polls since October 2021, has promised to be the agent of change that Britain wants. During the campaign, he pledged to grow the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0economy by reforming planning laws and investing in a new industrial strategy. He\u00a0said he\u00a0will set up a national wealth fund with \u00a37.3 billion\u00a0($9.3bn)\u00a0of public money that will help pay for the\u00a0transition to net zero\u00a0emissions. An\u00a0\u00a38.3 billion ($10.5 billion) publicly owned energy company, Great British Energy, will see the\u00a0United Kingdom\u2019s energy grid\u00a0decarbonized\u00a0by 2030. Starmer says all this can be achieved without raising income taxes, though there are no commitments\u00a0on other levies, such as capital gains tax, which is paid on money made from selling assets, including property and shares. The rest of the\u00a0Labour\u00a0manifesto comprised a mix of modest centrism with soft socialism.\u00a0It included imposing\u00a0taxes on private schools to\u00a0help\u00a0pay for state education\u00a0and windfall\u00a0levies\u00a0on energy companies to fund the transition to clean energy. There were\u00a0also\u00a0commitments on workers\u2019 rights, cutting waiting lists for health care\u00a0and\u00a0also controlling immigration. Critics on the right say that Starmer will need to raise taxes to fund his plans, while\u00a0skeptics\u00a0on the left say his manifesto is not bold or ambitious enough to change Britain for the better. In short,\u00a0this is\u00a0a long list of things to sort out in a five-year term when public finances are in disarray. The question for Starmer\u00a0now\u00a0is whether the mess is too big for him to fix and whether he has the political skill to bring about the change he promised. Who is Keir Starmer? On paper,\u00a0the 61-year-old\u00a0Starmer looks like a classic establishment figure. Once a leading human rights lawyer, he became Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 2008, running the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales \u2013\u00a0a high-profile job for which he was knighted, making him the first ever Labour leader to enter the job with the prefix Sir to their name. Starmer, however, is - by the standards of modern political leaders - from relatively humble beginnings. Born in 1962, Starmer grew up in a small town to the south of London. His father was a toolmaker who worked in a factory, his mother was a nurse who suffered with severe physical disabilities, which ultimately led to one of her legs being amputated. While Starmer has never claimed to have suffered poverty, he has talked of financial struggles that affected his family, as well as the learning difficulties that held back his younger brother. Clearly, these early experiences shaped Starmer\u2019s politics. He has talked about noticing people looking down on his father for working in a factory or bullying his brother. His parents were political, naming their\u00a0eldest after the first Labour leader in parliament, Keir Hardie. \u201cHe\u2019s the first Labour leader in a generation to talk about class and snobbery,\u201d\u00a0Tom Baldwin, author of \u201cKeir Starmer: The Biography,\u201d\u00a0told CNN.\u00a0\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make him a class warrior but someone who understands the different layers of pride, aspiration and guilt\u2026 He feels the sting of the disrespect his dad experienced\u2026 He talks a lot about his sister who has led a precarious life as a carer, having not gone to university.\u201d Starmer chose to study law at the University of Leeds, before completing a postgraduate\u00a0degree\u00a0at the University of Oxford. He initially thought he would have a legal career working for trade unions, but as his politics evolved in line with his studies, he became increasingly interested in human rights. What does he believe? Starmer has been on something of a journey since entering politics. He was elected to Parliament in 2015 at the age of 52 and\u00a0entered\u00a0the shadow cabinet\u00a0a\u00a0little over a year later. Corbyn,\u00a0then the Labour leader, made Starmer his Brexit chief following the 2016 referendum. Corbyn is a controversial figure in British politics and serving in his top team is still something that haunts Starmer. Corbyn had historically been\u00a0on\u00a0the far left of the Labour Party. Prior to becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn had at various points in his long career supported nuclear disarmament,\u00a0and\u00a0withdrawal from NATO, and said it was a \u201ctragedy\u201d that Osama bin Laden was killed rather than put on trial. Starmer was in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet\u00a0for\u00a0the 2017 and 2019 general elections \u2013 something the Conservatives bring up regularly as evidence that he is a threat to national security, having tried twice to make Corbyn prime minister. However, Starmer has since kicked Corbyn out of\u00a0the\u00a0Labour Party following an investigation into\u00a0antisemitism\u00a0during Corbyn\u2019s time as leader. Starmer\u00a0has also said\u00a0that he supported Corbyn knowing he would lose. Pressed on that point in a BBC \u201cQuestion Time\u201d program, he said Corbyn \u201cwould be a better prime minister\u201d than \u201cwhat we got\u201d in\u00a0Boris Johnson. Starmer also argues\u00a0that he\u00a0has brought Labour back to a position of electability. This result proves that he was right, but critics of Starmer on the left say that he used Corbyn and\u00a0his wing\u00a0of the Labour Party to win the party leadership in 2020 \u2013 committing to\u00a0several\u00a0left-wing positions\u00a0such as\u00a0nationalizing public services, scrapping university tuition fees and reversing\u00a0Conservative welfare reforms \u2013 only to abandon those pledges\u00a0once he got closer to\u00a0power. James Schneider, Corbyn\u2019s former communications chief, told CNN: \u201cStarmer is not a principled man. His campaign to become Labour leader was systemically dishonest. His cynicism and lack of policies to improve people\u2019s lives will lead to a deep disillusionment that could either feed the hard right or a future people\u2019s movement for change.\u201d Starmer has at various times responded to accusations that he has drifted politically by saying that he puts his country before his political party, and that it\u2019s only possible to change things if you are in power. Can Starmer change Britain? Whether you think Starmer\u2019s\u00a0current\u00a0plan is unambitious, dishonest, or exactly what Britain needs, it\u2019s impossible to push through policy without political and personal capital. Dominic Grieve, a Conservative politician who served as\u00a0attorney\u00a0general while Starmer was DPP, speaks glowingly of this period. \u201cHe ran his department very efficiently and effectively at a really difficult time because his budget had been cut. It was genuinely very impressive,\u201d\u00a0Grieve told CNN. Grieve\u00a0added\u00a0that Starmer was able to be an effective manager because \u201che is not bogged down with years of political ideology or baggage. He can see what is wrong and can address it.\u201d Much as Starmer\u2019s allies might see this as a strength, his opponents, from both sides of politics,\u00a0see it as a weakness. To those on the right, Starmer is a man who would say anything to get in power. He is someone who\u00a0supported\u00a0Corbyn \u2013\u00a0who is anti-NATO and has repeatedly been accused of being a terrorist\u00a0sympathizer \u2013\u00a0to get what he wants and is a danger to Britain. To the left, he is someone who doesn\u2019t have the conviction\u00a0to make radical changes\u00a0and, once in office,\u00a0will not be materially that different to a Conservative leader. Starmer\u00a0is now set to have\u00a0an\u00a0enormous majority in the\u00a0House of Commons. But\u00a0the future may not be so simple.\u00a0Given\u00a0the current state of Britain\u2019s finances, the circumstances of\u00a0Labour\u2019s\u00a0victory and, even Starmer\u2019s own personality traits, it might mean he doesn\u2019t have quite the blank check\u00a0that a leader with virtually no opposition\u00a0in parliament\u00a0would typically enjoy. An\u00a0inability to turn that parliamentary power into tangible results\u00a0at a time when voters are crying out for something different\u00a0could mean that five years from now, his moderate, safety-first center-left program may ultimately be\u00a0seen as\u00a0just as big a political gamble as any of those the Conservatives took in the\u00a0past 14 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/europe/keir-starmer-labour-prime-minister-profile-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

The Thompson Fire has consumed over 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday, drawing hundreds of firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat in the Oroville, California, area. As of Thursday morning, the fire is 7% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fire has injured 11 firefighters, according to Chris Peterson, a California Fire spokesperson. Heat-related illnesses have affected eight firefighters, who have been evaluated and are in the process of being cleared, Peterson said. Three other firefighters were hurt when a fire engine was involved in a rollover accident Wednesday morning, Peterson said. All three were taken to the hospital and two have since been released. As of Thursday morning, 12,000 residents living in and around Oroville remain under evacuation orders, Peterson said. At least four structures have been destroyed and more than 12,000 remain threatened by the fire, according to a Cal Fire\u00a0incident update. Oroville resident Rachael Thompson could see the flames and smoke from her backyard before she and three of her\u00a0family\u00a0members fled their home\u00a0Tuesday night. \u201cIt was a rough night for our\u00a0family,\u201d Thompson\u00a0told CNN\u00a0in\u00a0a message.\u00a0\u201cThe smoke\u00a0in\u00a0our home was\u00a0incredibly bad even with 4 purifiers going.\u201d Though she has since received word that the fire has moved away from her home, she worries for her neighbors and friends, many of whom are displaced and don\u2019t know if their homes are still standing. \u201cWe hope our friends and\u00a0family\u2019s homes make it and that they\u2019re all safe,\u201d she said. Californians are all too familiar with the sudden devastation that wildfires bring. The Thompson Fire is burning just 20 miles south of Paradise, where California\u2019s deadliest wildfire killed 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. There are now over two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest, according to Cal Fire. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing fires on the coast in San Diego, to the foothills in Butte,\u201d Cal Fire Deputy Director Nick Schuler told CNN Wednesday. \u201cOur\u00a0firefighters are battling fires across California and often times on the line for more than 24 hours. It\u2019s difficult conditions that they face.\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the area of the Thompson Fire Wednesday, clearing the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with 139,590 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 7,812 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen so far in California \u2013 more than 600% increase in wildfires,\u201d Schuler told CNN. The extreme heat is combining with gusty winds and low humidity to set the stage for rapid fire spread through already parched vegetation, and it represents another obstacle for firefighters battling the blaze. Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the Thompson Fire zone. \u201cThis winter we enjoyed a lot of precipitation and that brought a lot of vegetation that was green just a few weeks ago,\u201d Schuler said. \u201cNow, with that heat increased temperatures drying out, resulting in rapid fire growth across the state.\u201d The Basin Fire in California\u2019s Fresno County is 46% contained at 13,980 acres. Meanwhile, firefighters have the Fresno June Lightning Complex nearly fully contained to 10,669 acres. \u201cFirefighters are likely to have a very challenging week ahead,\u201d Cal Fire officials said in a video update Tuesday. \u201cAll it takes is one spark to start a major wildfire putting lives at risk.\u201d Oroville will see\u00a0record temperatures of 110 or more each of the next five days. Saturday may reach an\u00a0all-time record high of 113 \u2013 making it that much harder for fire crews to fight the blaze. No relief from the extreme heat for days Record-breaking heat is making the Fourth of July week a dangerous one across much of the West and from the southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic. Nationwide, more than 140 million people across more than 20 states in parts of the South and West are under heat alerts \u2013 and there will be no relief until the middle of next week. \u201cThe duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cHeat impacts can compound over time, therefore it is important to remain weather aware and follow the advice of local officials.\u201d Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of Oregon will also experience triple digits Friday, and the heat could last up to five days with noted poor overnight relief, says the National Weather Service Portland. Jessica Vega Pederson, chair of Multnomah Country, declared a state of emergency effective this weekend, noted a news release from the county Wednesday. Multnomah County\u2019s health officer, Dr. Richard Bruno, said in a news release: \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend. They\u2019ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.\u201d Multnomah County is the state\u2019s most populous county and home to Portland, where Mayor Ted Wheeler has also declared a state of emergency. Starting Friday, the cities of Hood River, Portland and Salem are all forecast for temperatures of 100 Fahrenheit over a five-day span, according to the National Weather Service. Eugene will face a four-day stretch of 100 Fahrenheit temps. Noah Alviz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service of Portland, told CNN via phone: \u201cIn June 2021, for a heatwave here in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington \u2026 Portland reached an all-time record of 116. Now, with this heatwave, we\u2019re not expecting temperatures to get as intense as that. However, what we are more concerned about is the duration of this heatwave.\u201d During the summer of 2021, Multnomah County reported 72 heat deaths with \u201call but three of those deaths resulting from a single five-day heat wave in June,\u201d according to the county. \u201cThat is a big concern from us when we see heat of this magnitude in our area,\u201d Alviz said. There is the additional concern of staying cool in an area where many don\u2019t have air conditioning, Alviz says, which has resulted in the opening of numerous cooling shelters in Multnomah County. Meanwhile, much of California, excluding the coastal regions, as well as western Nevada and southwestern Arizona, are expected to see searing high temperatures from 100 to 110 degrees \u2013 about 10 to 20 degrees above normal. Las Vegas, Nevada, could exceed its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees Sunday or Monday, and Death Valley, California, could approach 130 degrees by Sunday. As the heat dome expands north, above-normal temperatures are expected to hit parts of Oregon and Washington beginning Friday, with high temperatures ranging between 95 to 105 degrees.  Some cities could swelter through multiple days of temperatures well above 100 degrees with some, including Sacramento, potentially\u00a0seeing a full week of highs over 105 degrees. Already, several cities have set or tied daily high-temperature records, with Fresno and Livermore both hitting 110 degrees Wednesday. Heat\u00a0is expected to spread to\u00a0the\u00a0Northwest and to parts of Arizona\u00a0including Phoenix by\u00a0the\u00a0weekend, where triple-digit temperatures are expected, with parts of Arizona\u00a0seeing highs above 110 degrees.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/weather/west-heatwave-wildfires-california-butte/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Donaldson appeared in front of a preliminary inquiry Wednesday, which decided to push ahead with a trial, scheduled for September 10, according to a statement sent to CNN by the Northern Ireland Courts\u00a0and Tribunals\u00a0Service\u00a0(NICTS). Donaldson stepped down as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in March after he was charged with 11 sexual offenses. The politician has since been charged with a further seven offenses. The 18 alleged offenses include: one charge of rape, 13 charges of indecent assault of a female child and four charges of gross indecency towards a child. Donaldson was asked in court if he wanted to comment on the charges, according to PA Media. \u201cNot at this stage,\u201d he replied, the news agency reported. His wife Eleanor Donaldson is also set to stand trial in September and has been charged with one charge of aiding and abetting rape, three charges of aiding and abetting assault of a female child and one charge of cruelty towards a person under the age of 16. Donaldson led the DUP from 2019, throughout much of the turbulent Brexit process, regularly voicing his opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, a key part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that ensured there was no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both Donaldson and his wife have previously denied all charges, Irish public broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported Wednesday. Donaldson\u2019s trial was announced as people in Northern Ireland were preparing to vote in the UK general election. As one of the UK\u2019s four devolved nations, Northern Ireland has 18 seats in the Westminster parliament. Northern Irish politicians can choose to either run for a seat in Westminster or for a seat in the devolved legislature, the Northern Ireland Assembly. Lawmakers from the leading Nationalist party, Sinn F\u00e9in do not take up their seats in Westminster if elected. Donaldson had been slated to run again in the Lagan Valley constituency but has been replaced by former DUP party colleague Jonathan Buckley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/europe/jeffrey-donaldson-sex-offense-charges-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Marine\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen,\u00a0figurehead of the French far-right National Rally (RN) party, vowed a prime minister from her party would prevent Kyiv using French-supplied long-range weapons to strike inside Russia and would stymie French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s suggestion\u00a0he might\u00a0put French boots on Ukrainian soil. \u201cIf Emmanuel Macron wants to send troops to Ukraine and the prime minister is against it, then there are no troops sent to Ukraine,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThe prime minister has the final say.\u201d Marine\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0gave a wide-ranging interview to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour on Thursday ahead of the second-round vote in France\u2019s snap\u00a0parliamentary election, called\u00a0by Macron\u00a0after\u00a0National Rally\u2019s stunning European election results in May. She tore into the national soccer side\u2019s star striker,\u00a0Kylian Mbapp\u00e9,\u00a0refused to\u00a0commit to\u00a0immediately throwing\u00a0out racist candidates in her party and signalled a\u00a0stark\u00a0shift\u00a0in\u00a0France\u2019s level of\u00a0support for Ukraine, if elected. Presenting\u00a0herself firmly as\u00a0in the French political mainstream,\u00a0three-time unsuccessful presidential candidate Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0struck a confident, combative figure, days away from perhaps the greatest political victory of her career. With polls pointing towards the National Rally holding the biggest share of\u00a0the 577\u00a0seats in the National Assembly come\u00a0Monday morning,\u00a0although potentially not achieving\u00a0an\u00a0absolute majority,\u00a0Macron will likely offer them the chance to choose the country\u2019s next prime minister.\u00a0Le Pen\u2019s youthful disciple and party leader Jordan Bardella has previously said he will only accept the premiership if National Rally wins by a large enough margin. Even without an RN prime minister, any legislative action in the French parliament will have to navigate around a far-right center of gravity. If there is an RN\u00a0premiership, it would\u00a0set up a tense \u201ccohabitation\u201d with Macron\u2019s centrist presidency, especially over centerpiece policies like French support for Ukraine\u2019s war against Russia. Beyond\u00a0blocking\u00a0potential\u00a0troop deployments to Ukraine \u2013 mooted by Macron\u00a0as a way to boost\u00a0military\u00a0instructors\u2019 efficiency \u2013\u00a0Le Pen\u00a0told CNN that Kyiv\u2019s permission to use French-supplied long-range missiles inside Russia would also be rescinded. Macron was one of the first\u00a0leaders publicly to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with Western weapons, setting the stage for Washington to do the same. This has allowed\u00a0Kyiv\u00a0to target Russian military bases, formations and artillery\u00a0used to launch attacks\u00a0into Ukraine. Aside from troop deployments, Le Pen said her only \u201cred line\u201d on Ukraine was stopping France becoming a \u201cco-belligerent\u201d in the conflict via the use of long-range French missiles against targets on Russian soil. Most Western leaders currently do not consider that such supplies constitute co-belligerence with Ukraine. Le Pen: Mbapp\u00e9\u00a0not representative Le Pen directed\u00a0most of her ire closer to home. Speaking from her party\u2019s seat in Paris,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0lashed out at French soccer star\u00a0Mbapp\u00e9,\u00a0who has made\u00a0repeated comments in recent weeks seemingly haranguing the far right. Undoubtedly the brightest star of French football today, he joined a host of celebrities\u00a0this week\u00a0in calling on voters\u00a0to mobilize\u00a0to keep the far-right from power. \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency. We can\u2019t\u00a0leave our country in the hands of these people,\u201d\u00a0Mbapp\u00e9\u00a0said\u00a0Thursday, following National Rally\u2019s strong first-round showing. \u201cIt\u2019s really urgent. I think that we\u2019ve seen the results, it\u2019s catastrophic.\u201d Speaking last month, earlier\u00a0in the Euros\u00a02024 soccer tournament in Germany, the striker,\u00a0whose family originally come from Algeria and Cameroon, stressed that he didn\u2019t want to \u201crepresent\u00a0a country\u201d that\u00a0didn\u2019t embody his \u201cvalues.\u201d Le Pen rejected his comments, dismissing him as unrepresentative. \u201cFrench people are fed up of being\u00a0lectured and advised on how to vote,\u201d\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0told CNN. \u201cMbapp\u00e9\u00a0doesn\u2019t represent French people with an immigration background, because there are far more of them living on the minimum wage, who can\u2019t afford housing and can\u2019t afford heating, than people like Mr. Mbapp\u00e9,\u201d she said. Accusations of racism If National Rally wins big enough\u00a0in Sunday\u2019s election,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0can expect to\u00a0see her loyal lieutenant\u00a0Bardella installed as France\u2019s prime minister. She will have unquestionably succeeded in bringing her party into the political mainstream. Having won nearly a third of French votes cast in the European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0elections\u00a0in May,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0refused to be labelled as a \u201cfar-right\u201d politician, which she said carries a stigma. \u201cIt does not correspond to what we are. And not at all to what the far right is in the United States,\u201d she\u00a0claimed. Le\u00a0Pen\u2019s party currently supports ending the automatic right to citizenship for people born to foreign parents in France\u00a0and\u00a0severely restricting citizenship by naturalization.\u00a0Additionally, the party proposes restricting the rights of foreigners to access some social services, including housing, with preferential access given to French nationals. The\u00a0second\u00a0pledge\u00a0listed in National Rally\u2019s manifesto\u00a0is a law targeting Islamist ideologies, although it does not elaborate on how. Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0fended off accusations of racism\u00a0made\u00a0against some of the hundreds of candidates her party fielded for the election. \u201cI think that in any political movement, there can be what we call \u2018black sheep,\u2019\u201d she said. One candidate, Florent de Kersauson,\u00a0reposted\u00a0a promotional picture showing a mixed-race child as \u201cfalse Brittany,\u201d another, Daniel Grenon, reportedly said North Africans have no place in \u201chigh places\u201d in France during a recorded local debate, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Grenon has claimed this was an \u201cerroneous\u201d quotation. \u201cI\u2019m not contesting the existence of these comments,\u201d\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0said, referring to the accusations\u00a0levelled against her candidates. She promised to see\u00a0complaints\u00a0tackled internally by the party\u2019s conflicts commission\u00a0but\u00a0refused to have such candidates removed\u00a0immediately\u00a0from the ballot. \u201cThat\u2019s not my vision of justice,\u201d she said. Ties with Russia Cohabiting with the staunchly pro-European Emmanuel Macron will have its complications for the keenly anti-Brussels National Rally. Top of the list of sensitivities is likely to be foreign policy, where\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0and Macron rarely see eye to eye. A far-right government\u00a0would\u00a0be welcome news for Russian President Vladimir Putin though. Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0has landed in hot water in the past over Russia. She\u2019s boasted of her admiration for Putin, refused to condemn Putin\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea\u00a0in 2014\ufeff, and even took out a\u00a0huge loan from a Russian bank. Many held similar suspicions ahead of the election of\u00a0hard-right\u00a0culture warrior Italian Prime Minister\u00a0Giorgia\u00a0Meloni\u00a0in 2022.\u00a0But in office, she\u2019s proved a team player in Europe\u2019s support for Kyiv. There\u2019s no such absolution\u00a0yet\u00a0for\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0though. On Wednesday, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry posted a\u00a0picture of\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0on X, stating that French voters are seeking \u201ca break from the dictate of Washington and Brussels.\u201d Pressed on the post\u2019s relevance,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u2019s answer may point to her following Meloni\u2019s hard shoulder to Moscow. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of interference, and in that sense, I find it unacceptable,\u201d\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0said of the post. She\u2019s broken many molds already in her time in politics; the weight of real political power for National Rally may change her further still.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/france-le-pen-ukraine-mbappe-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

The news brings the total number of arrests to 21. Wednesday\u2019s coup attempt prompted shock around the world, with images out of the capital La Paz showing military personnel occupying a square, armored vehicles ramming the palace door and soldiers trying to break into government offices. A report sent to CNN by the Bolivian government said military officials first held meetings in May to plot the coup attempt. The meetings were led by former army chief Gen.

The National Rally party, which is slated to win big in this Sunday\u2019s second round of voting, has drawn criticism and concern from French celebrities of dual nationality, worried about the impact of their immigration policy plans. The party, headed by 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, hopes to restrict dual nationals from accessing certain state jobs. It also wants to strip citizenship rights from those born to foreign parents on French soil. Popstar Nakamura, who immigrated to France from Mali as a child and rose to fame with her smash hit song \u201cDjadja,\u201d made the call in a social media post on Tuesday that zeroed in on her own experiences of racism in France. The 29-year-old  said in her post that she is \u201cwell placed to understand and know the place of racism in our country.\u201d Nakamura said that although she had previously chosen not to weigh in on certain issues, she now understood that her role as a major musical artist requires her to \u201cspeak out\u201d during such an \u201cimportant moment.\u201d She called on her fans to vote against \u201cthe only extreme to be condemned,\u201d in what appeared to be a reference to the far right. In a separate post, Nakamura directly referenced the National Rally party, saying: \u201cF*** the National Rally.\u201d Nakamura later deleted the post, according to reporting from CNN affiliate BFMTV. Nakamura herself is no stranger to threats from the far right, having previously found herself at the center of a controversy earlier this year when speculation mounted that she would perform the classic French song \u201cJe ne regrette rien\u201d at the Olympics opening ceremony. Far-right fringe groups and politicians, including Marion Mar\u00e9chal, a far-right lawmaker and niece of Marine Le Pen, complained that Nakamura does not even \u201csing in French.\u201d This swipe was seemingly a reference to the blend of French and African slang that Nakamura uses in her lyrics. France\u2019s top sports stars have also been using their platforms to urge the public not to vote for the far right. Jules Kounde, a 25-year-old French Beninese national who plays on the French national team, used a press conference during the Euros tournament to share what he called his own \u201cpolitical position.\u201d \u201cI was disappointed to see the direction France is taking, with strong support for a party against our values,\u201d Kounde told journalists after the match between France and Belgium on Monday. \u201cI believe it\u2019s important to block the extreme right, the National Rally, because this party will not lead our country towards more freedom.\u201d Kounde\u2019s remarks echo comments from fellow football star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who told journalists earlier during the tournament that he is \u201cagainst extremes.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9, whose family originally came from Algeria and Cameroon, stressed that he didn\u2019t want to \u201crepresent a country\u201d that didn\u2019t embody his \u201cvalues.\u201d The French far right\u2019s strong showing in the first round has prompted concern from several European countries and even top United Nations officials. The UN\u2019s human rights chief Volker Turk told a press conference in Geneva Wednesday that recent far-right gains across Europe should serve as an \u201calarm bell.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/europe/france-election-nakamura-opposes-far-right-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Demiral scored twice in Turkey\u2019s 2-1 win and celebrated by making a gesture known as the \u201cwolf salute,\u201d which is associated with the Turkish right-wing extremist group \u201cGrey Wolves.\u201d UEFA announced the decision to suspend Demiral on Friday, a day before Turkey\u2019s quarterfinal against the Netherlands. In its statement, UEFA said its appeals body charged the defender \u201cfor failing to comply with the general principles of conduct, for violating the basic rules of decent conduct, for using sports events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature and for bringing the sport of football into disrepute.\u201d The Turkish Football Federation confirmed to CNN that its legal department is working on an appeal to the suspension. \u201cDoes anyone say that the Germans have an eagle on their jerseys? Does anyone say that the French have a rooster on their jerseys?\u201d Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said to Turkish broadcaster TRT. \u201cThere, Merih expressed his excitement with this image. Thereupon, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs called their officials and the necessary steps are being taken accordingly. \u201cHopefully, on Saturday we will leave the field with a victory and move on to the next round. Unless something extraordinary happens, we have decided to go to the match.\u201d CNN\u2019s German affiliate network NTV and TRT reported that Erdogan is set to come to Berlin on Saturday for Turkey\u2019s game against the Netherlands. Servet Yardimci, UEFA Executive Board Member and Turkish Football Federation (TFF) Presidential Candidate, called the ban \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cRequesting punishment for a natural celebration after the match is over in a tournament that is running smoothly is an intervention in the independence of football,\u201d he wrote in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cOur football player shared a natural joy when he was celebrating with Turkish fans the happiness of a moment \u2026 there is no element here that could hurt your opponent or any community. The player naturally expressed his feelings at the press conference he attended after the match. \u201cFootball players\u2019 celebration methods and manners should not be penalized unless they are derogatory to any group or group or violate basic rules of courtesy.\u201d Yardimci added: \u201cI would like to emphasize my belief that this mistake must be corrected before it is too late.\u201d The Turkish minister of youth and sports, Osman A\u015fk\u0131n Bak, said on X: \u201cWe condemn UEFA\u2019s unfair and biased decision, which we believe has no legal basis and is entirely political. \u201cWe will continue to seek our rights through legal means against this double standard applied to our country and our national football player Merih Demiral. \u201cWe believe in our football players. They will also give the necessary answer on the green field!\u201d Following the win against Austria, Demiral posted a picture of himself making the gesture on X. \u201cHappy is one who calls themselves a Turk,\u201d the defender captioned the post. \u201cI had a certain specific celebration in mind. That\u2019s what I did. It has to do with the Turkish identity because I\u2019m very proud to be a Turk. And I felt that to the fullest after the second goal, so I ended up doing that gesture,\u201d Demiral told reporters after the game. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that I did that.\u201d Germany summoned Turkey\u2019s ambassador in Berlin Thursday in a tit for tat over the celebration after Turkey recalled the German ambassador in Ankara. German representatives discussed the incident with the Turkish ambassador in Berlin, the German foreign ministry added. Germany\u2019s Interior Minister, Nancy Faeser, warned Wednesday \u201cthe symbols of Turkish right-wing extremists have no place in our stadiums\u201d and said that \u201cusing the European football championships as a platform for racism is completely unacceptable.\u201d Faeser added that the \u201cGrey Wolves\u201d group is under surveillance in Germany.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/sport/uefa-bans-turkey-defender-merih-demiral-celebration-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_nigel-farage-reform-party-win-gbr-intl", "text": "Nigel Farage,\u00a0a driving force behind Britain\u2019s Brexit movement and a confidant of former US President Donald Trump, has been elected to parliament for the first time, as his upstart right-wing Reform UK party looks to shake up the country\u2019s politics. Farage becomes a member of Britain\u2019s parliament on his\u00a0eighth attempt after winning with 46.2% of the vote\u00a0in the heavily pro-Brexit Clacton, a seaside town on England\u2019s southeastern coast where Reform UK had polled well. With most of the votes now counted, results indicate Reform UK has won at least five seats in the House of Commons, a comparatively strong showing in Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system where smaller parties often struggle to translate their national support into parliamentary seats. Farage\u2019s Reform UK party attacked the Conservative Party on its failure to bring down rates of legal and illegal migration. That message appears to have won over a considerable number of socially conservative voters, with Reform UK candidates splitting the right-wing vote and contributing to the Conservatives\u2019 losses. Farage, an outspoken and polarizing figure, has long been known for using alarmist and confrontational language when discussing immigration. Since announcing his candidacy, Farage has warned supporters of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of asylum seekers, and last month he sparked outrage from political opponents after saying the West \u201cprovoked\u201d\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The veteran Euroskeptic, played a leading role in bringing about Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and has remained a divisive and disruptive figure in the country\u2019s politics since. Farage is perhaps best-known outside of the UK for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump, recently campaigning alongside him. But he has never been elected to parliament, losing seven elections since 1994 before this victory.\u00a0He won Clacton on a massive swing towards Reform UK, picking up 21,225 votes to the Conservatives\u2019 12,820. Friday\u2019s results now give Reform UK a small but significant base from which to oppose Labour leader and soon-to-be new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a crucial parliamentary platform. \u201cIt\u2019s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the center right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Farage said after winning the seat. He pledged to \u201cchallenge the general election properly in 2029,\u201d and promised to turn his rhetoric toward the Labour Party as it enters government. In many seats around the UK, Reform came second to Labour. Farage said the \u201cLabour government will be in trouble very, very quickly and we will now be targeting Labour votes. We\u2019re coming for Labour \u2013 be in no doubt about that.\u201d His presence during the election campaign upended the Conservative Party\u2019s efforts to win back socially conservative, pro-Brexit voters. His win comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge. Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. In snap French elections, far-right National Rally\u00a0won the first round last week. Speaking to CNN Thursday night, Politico deputy UK editor Rosa Prince said the result showed a \u201cvery widespread disaffection with the Conservative Party\u201d and that Reform UK\u2019s far-right policies \u201creally chime with some parts of the electorate.\u201d \u201cThe big question is going to be whether the Conservative Party tries to draw him in to them and maybe even join forces, or whether they push him away,\u201d Prince said. \u201cBecause what you could have is a total realignment of the right\u2026 I think Nigel Farage is certainly going to be causing trouble in the Houses of Parliament.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/nigel-farage-reform-party-win-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Israeli officials believe Hamas\u2019 latest response will enable the two parties to enter detailed negotiations to reach an agreement, the source said. A deal, however, is still not finalized nor is it assured. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must first green-light entering into that next phase of negotiations; and it will likely take several weeks of difficult negotiations to negotiate the details of a potential agreement, including the identities of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for Israeli hostages held by Hamas and the sequencing of releases. Israeli negotiators are set to meet with Israel\u2019s political leadership, including Netanyahu, over the coming days to decide whether to enter this phase of detailed negotiations. Hamas has confirmed that it passed a response on an Israeli proposal to mediators Qatar and Egypt, repeating its demand for a complete ceasefire. \u201cWe have put forward some demands that achieve securing access to a complete ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces,\u201d Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, told CNN on Wednesday. Hamas also said in a separate statement on Wednesday that it had \u201cexchanged some ideas\u201d with the mediators aiming to stop \u201cthe aggression against our Palestinian people.\u201d Hamas added in a later statement that it has dealt with the Israeli proposal \u201cpositively.\u201d Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh\u00a0was in touch with the mediators in Qatar and Egypt for hours, discussing with them ideas \u201cin order to\u00a0reach an agreement\u201d to end the war in Gaza, the statement said. \u201cCommunication has also taken place between the head of the movement and officials in Turkey regarding the recent developments,\u201d the statement added.

The development comes as the Hostage and Missing Families Forum warned in a statement that millions of Israelis would take to the streets if the government fails to secure a deal to release the hostages. \u201cThe people of Israel show time and time again in every poll that they are in favor of a complete deal for the return of all hostages. We will not allow the government\u2019s ministers to torpedo the deal again,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe government is at the highest moral test of its tenure: the continuation of abandonment or a determined action for rescue and restoration,\u201d the statement added. \u201cIt\u2019s either the complete return of the hostages or all Israeli citizens will be taking to the roads and intersections.\u201d Additional reporting by Abeer Salman, Ibrahim Dahman, Tamar Michaelis.

The organization, founded by 2011 CNN Hero Yuval Roth, had grown to 1,300 volunteers and was helping about 140 patients a day before the war. On October 7, during Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks on Israel, several of the group\u2019s volunteers were killed. Others were taken hostage. Today, Road to Recovery\u2019s work continues, and Roth feels that it is as crucial as ever. \u201cWe \u2026 believe that patient transportation has far greater value than just humanitarian assistance,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt is an opportunity for us to show our Palestinian neighbors a different face than what they know in their reality. It is a chance for encounters that break down barriers and stigmas.\u201d On October 8, volunteers were waiting at checkpoints at the West Bank to pick up Palestinian patients and their families. The organization currently transports between 40 to 50 patients a day between the checkpoints and Israeli hospitals and medical providers. Roth started this work in 2006 as a way to cope with personal tragedy. In 1993, his brother Udi was kidnapped and killed by members of Hamas. After his loss, Roth channeled his anger into peace. The organization says it has since provided transportation to more than 50,000 sick Palestinians. \u201cEach trip is an opportunity to make a \u2018small hour of peace.\u2019\u201d Roth said. \u201cEspecially now, just to show compassion and love. \u2026 This is the medicine for the hostility and for the hateness.\u201d Sometimes, the Israeli volunteer drivers and Palestinian passengers are able to communicate in Arabic, Hebrew, or English. When there\u2019s no shared spoken language, they communicate through gestures, which Roth finds to be more powerful than words. \u201cIf we really want one day normal life for us and for the Palestinians, we should make effort to achieve it,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you sit and you wait that something will happen.

Unlike some other countries, such as the United States, when a new British prime minister comes to power, the transition into both the new role and home happens almost immediately. That means, not only will Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, be settling into his home down the road from the Houses of Parliament, but so will his wife, Victoria, and their two teenage children. So, who is Victoria Starmer, and what do we know about the new occupants of 10 Downing Street? Starmer\u2019s wife, whom he usually refers to as Vic, kept a relatively low profile during the election campaign. Both lawyers by training, they married in 2007 \u2013 the year before Starmer became Director of Public Prosecutions. Their relationship grew out of an unlikely first meeting at work, as the Labour leader told Piers Morgan in 2021. Then a barrister, he was preparing for a court case and demanded to speak to the lawyer who had drawn up documents relating to the case. That was Victoria. He asked if they were accurate, and once the conversation was over, he heard her say, \u201cWho the bleep does he think he is?\u201d before hanging up on him. He told Morgan he pursued her for months after that, and they have been together ever since. \u201cVic is beautiful, she is grounded, we share values and we laugh together,\u201d Starmer said. Victoria, whose parents are Jewish, now works in occupational health in the NHS. \u201cHalf of the family are Jewish, they\u2019re either here or in Israel,\u201d he told The Guardian last month, adding that he and his wife are \u201cvery keen\u201d for their children to understand their heritage. Meanwhile, the prime minister has spoken about his children\u2019s concerns about the house move. \u201cDeep down they\u2019re worried that this (their lives) could change, which is why we will fiercely protect their privacy.\u201d So determined is Starmer, that he refers to them in interviews as \u201cmy boy\u201d and \u201cmy girl.\u201d \u201cFrom the very start we took the decision that we would keep them as protected as we possibly can, so we won\u2019t have any photo shoots with the children and we don\u2019t name them in public,\u201d he told British broadcaster ITV\u2019s \u201cThis Morning\u201d show. Starmer told The Guardian he is \u201cacutely aware\u201d how his job impacts his family, saying of his children, \u201cthese are formative years. We keep life as ordinary and unchanged as possible.\u201d Earlier this year, pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside the family\u2019s home in Kentish Town, north London, where they unfurled a banner saying \u201cStarmer stop the killing\u201d and left rows of children\u2019s shoes. The Starmers\u2019 main hopes, he told \u201cThis Morning,\u201d were for their children to be \u201chappy and confident.\u201d That might be helped by a new addition, he admitted, as a move to Downing Street is likely to see his children \u201cramp up\u2026 their campaign for a dog.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/victoria-starmer-profile-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Kehillat Shaarei Torah\u00a0of Toronto \u201cwas one of the synagogues targeted by the suspected hate-motivated vandalism\u201d in the city overnight, a spokesperson for the synagogue told CNN. \u201cThis is the third antisemitic vandalism that has taken place at our synagogue since April 19th of this year,\u201d Executive Director Michael Gilmore said in an email Sunday. Gilmore said the attacks encapsulate the dangers members of the Jewish community across Canada face daily. \u201cFortunately, as Jewish generations before us have done, we have come together as a community stronger, more united, and with a greater sense of purpose than ever before,\u201d he wrote. Police the other facility was the Pride of Israel Synagogue in North York, where rocks were thrown through the front windows. Carl Zeliger, vice chairman of the Pride of Israel congregation, said the damage there was \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201chas to be viewed as an antisemitic act,\u201d according to a statement from B\u2019nai Brith Canada. Images show large holes through the front windows and shattered glass covering the entrance to the synagogue. CNN has reached out to the Pride of Israel Synagogue for further comment. Police confirmed the incidents are being investigated as suspected hate crimes. They described the suspect as 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-9 inches, and wearing a light-colored jacket and a black helmet with a visor. Police officials said they are increasing their presence in both areas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/americas/toronto-suspected-hate-motivated-attacks-synagogues/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_life-in-bhutan-intl-hnk", "text": "Located between China and India, the world\u2019s two most populous countries, high in the Himalayas, sits Bhutan. Known as the Land of the Thunder Dragon, it\u2019s a Buddhist monarchy of 700,000 residents that has only had regular television broadcasts since 1999. Most foreigners who have heard of Bhutan know two things: the country charges international visitors a $100/day sustainable development fee (aka tourist tax), and that it is the birthplace of the Gross National Happiness Index, a system intended to look after the well-being of citizens and the environment. As this once-hidden kingdom gradually opens up to the world, those things alone make it an intriguing travel destination, alongside historic temples, un-crowded hiking and trekking trails and stunning Himalayan landscapes. But is it really happy? And what does that mean for people living here? Its citizens have a variety of answers. \u201cThe first thing (foreigners) talk about is the gross national happiness that we promote in Bhutan,\u201d says KJ Temphel, founder of the conservation group Green Bhutan. \u201cI think definitely living in Bhutan, for me personally, it\u2019s quite peaceful and I\u2019m very happy to be here.\u201d The World Happiness Report, published annually by Oxford University and the United Nations, puts Nordic nations Finland, Sweden and Denmark at the top of its happiness rankings. The list ranks 143 nations and territories around the world \u2013 but Bhutan isn\u2019t one of them. \u201cI must say that our people were actually happy, but now due to all those modern things and all those technologies coming in, somehow we are disconnected more and then we tend to be more depressed and more sad,\u201d says Tandin Phubz, a creator of the Humans of Thimpu Facebook page, which features photos and profiles of everyday people in the capital in the style of Brandon Staunton\u2019s famous Humans of New York project. \u201cBhutan is a Buddhist country. Spirituality and religion have a very strong effect,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe thing is that with all those gadgets and televisions (people) are somehow distracted from this. They tend to forget to do their morning and evening prayers. They\u2019re on the phones watching TikToks, swiping up and down.\u201d Encountering the world Modernization is a relative term in Bhutan. Locals will proudly tell you that Thimpu is the only world capital without any traffic lights, and shops and restaurants are locally owned and run. Bhutan is the rare world destination that isn\u2019t full of international brands. While there are a few \u2013 outposts of the upscale Le Meridien and Aman hotel chains, for example \u2013 even the capital is mostly bereft of corporate logos. Entrepreneur Chokey Wangmo thinks it\u2019s unlikely that corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks would ever come to Bhutan \u2013 not because of local policies or customs, but because it wouldn\u2019t be a profitable market for them. \u201cOur population is so (small), we wouldn\u2019t be able to even get the money back for the franchise in the next 10 years,\u201d says Wangmo, who runs several businesses in the southern Bhutanese town of Gelephu, including a coffee shop. \u201cEven if the whole population comes and takes one coffee every day, it will be really hard for them to pay back (the franchise fee).\u201d Wangmo has a front-row seat to how Bhutan is changing. Gelephu, a town of about 10,000 people near the border of India\u2019s Darjeeling state, has been hand-selected as the site for a new \u201cMindfulness City,\u201d a project spearheaded by the country\u2019s king, Gyalpo Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. It seems impossible to imagine Bhutan without the country\u2019s fifth monarch. Portraits of the king and royal family \u2013 he and Queen Jetsun Pema have three young children \u2013 are in nearly every home and business in Bhutan, displayed the way other nations might hang up their national flags. Photos of the king are omnipresent in the country\u2019s Buddhist temples, placed alongside pictures of lamas and laden with offerings of flowers, fruits and sweets. \u201cIf you look at the houses of the private enterprise, the rich people in Bhutan, their houses are huge and quite decorative,\u201d says Temphel. \u201cBut if you look at our royal family houses, they\u2019re very small and they\u2019re just a simple living and I think humble. And that\u2019s how it matters. How they think about the country and the people, I think. It\u2019s not thinking about themselves, but they\u2019re thinking about the people in the country.\u201d A generation on the brink A growing number of young people are leaving Bhutan to study and work overseas. Phubz, who is in his 20s and currently lives in Perth, Australia pursuing a master\u2019s in communications, is part of Bhutan\u2019s new generation, balancing his love of family and heritage with a desire to see more of the world. \u201cThere\u2019s this Bhutanese quote where it says that, \u2018You do whatever the neighbor does. If he or she goes and milks the cow, you go and milk the cow. If they go and work in the fields, you go and work in the fields.\u2019\u201d He compares this to the current trend of young people leaving to work and study abroad. \u201cParents feel that, \u2018Oh, that neighbor\u2019s son or daughter is going to Australia, I have to send (mine) as well.\u2019\u201d Temphel echoes those sentiments, saying he is worried that Bhutan will have a big population imbalance with more old people than young ones, similar to other Asian countries like Japan and South Korea. \u201cMy worry is after seven years staying in other countries, you are more acquainted with the custom, the habits that you have in different countries, it would be very difficult for them to adjust immediately in Bhutan,\u201d he says. Those Bhutanese who do want to explore the wider world can\u2019t just grab their suitcases and head off. Only three countries have diplomatic embassies in Thimpu, which means that most international relationships have to go via India. Bhutan\u2019s currency, the ngultrum, is pegged to the Indian rupee, and most shops and businesses will accept both. The Henley Passport Index ranks Bhutan\u2019s passport 87th most powerful in the world, with its holders able to access 55 places visa-free \u2013 a list that does not include the United States, Australia or the European Union. Bhutan\u2019s sole international aviation hub, Paro International (PBH), is one of the most beautiful airport descents in the world \u2013 but also one of the most logistically challenging. Located in a valley between two mountains, only smaller planes can come in and out safely. As a result, Paro only offers short hops to nearby Bangkok, Dhaka, Kathmandu and New Delhi. Some of those logistics may become easier, though. In addition to being the home of the new Mindfulness City, Gelephu has been chosen for a new international airport. Its flatter terrain means that there will be space for longer runways \u2013 and, likely, jumbo jets that can go all the way to the Middle East, Europe and beyond. According to government data, the per capita income in Bhutan is 115,787 ngultrum ($1,387) per year. When a flight from Paro to Bangkok begins at $350, international travel is still out of reach for many Bhutanese. Foreigners who want to emigrate to Bhutan, though, don\u2019t have it easy. Only Bhutanese citizens can buy land, and the only way to get Bhutanese citizenship \u2013 even if you\u2019re married to someone from Bhutan \u2013 is by the personal approval of the king. What comes next Wangmo, who spent her student years in India before returning to Bhutan, has been able to see her homeland from both a local and foreign perspective. \u201cThe way we are living is old now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to learn and accept new ways.\u201d She gives several examples of workplace culture that she thinks have made it harder for business owners: for example, she couldn\u2019t find a bank in Bhutan that would allow her to fill out account paperwork online instead of going in person. Wangmo says that things like meeting scheduling, out-of-office messages, and online customer service generally don\u2019t exist in Bhutanese offices. Most jobs in Bhutan require traditional dress \u2013 a one-piece garment called a gho paired with knee-high socks for men, and a two-piece jacket and skirt set called a kari for women \u2013 to be worn while working, but some will swap into jeans and T-shirts on weekends. Temphel, of Green Bhutan, says that the Bhutanese mindset is community-centric, where everyone knows each other and looks out for each other. It\u2019s common for neighbors to stop by uninvited and for the whole village to visit a new baby or welcome someone back from the hospital. For Wangmo, this sense of community spirit can sometimes be stifling. She says that she has a hard time telling people that she wants to eat dinner alone or that she doesn\u2019t want guests over every day. And despite Bhutan\u2019s free public health care system, she believes one critical thing is missing \u2013 honesty around mental health. At Coffee Cat Caf\u00e9, which she owns and manages in Gelephu, patrons are encouraged to talk about their mental health with each other. Wangmo says that many people hit a breaking point during the pandemic as forced isolation took them out of the networks they knew so well. \u201cNobody was socializing because of the Covid thing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then, once they started talking, they understood how important it was to talk about what they were feeling. And I think that is really when the mental health (conversation) really came into light. Mental health, I think, it\u2019s a very, very personal struggle.\u201d To make it easier for people to open up, Coffee Cat Caf\u00e9 holds events like poetry readings. There are motivational quotes written on the walls and a well-stocked lending library. On their social media accounts, there are campaigns about ending period stigma and encouraging female entrepreneurs. For Wangmo, who is training her restaurant and caf\u00e9 staff to have a more tourist-centric mindset, change hasn\u2019t come quickly enough. \u201cJust because we are wearing different clothes and having all these cars from other countries, it\u2019s not going to get us there,\u201d she says. \u201c(Change is) going to hit us hard. Some people are not happy, some people are scared, they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, if they can survive it. But when we are one faith, we have to do this, there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/life-in-bhutan-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Instead of your Cinderellas, Elsas and Annas in their royal best, it\u2019s a fuzzy pink fox that\u2019s inspiring the princess-esque outfits of Disney-goers in their teens and 20s. LinaBell is the latest addition to a line of plush toys called \u201cDuffy and Friends,\u201d created by Disney for the Asian market. She has never made it onto the big screen, but she and her furry companions have resonated with fans in the region, becoming one of the company\u2019s best-selling franchises in the city\u2019s theme park. Young women in particular are drawing inspiration from the pastel-colored characters, creating coquettish looks. \u201cLinaBell is my favorite,\u201d said Liang Xiaoyu who was visiting from the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The 18-year-old was dressed in a pink-trimmed white frock, her hair in two loose ponytails, and was carrying a LinaBell backpack and keychain. Others spotted during a rainy June day channeled CookieAnn (a yellow dog who loves to bake), by wearing dog ear headbands as well as ShellieMay and Duffy, the line\u2019s two bears. Dressing up is popular at Disney theme parks across the world \u2014 not just for kids, but for adults as well. Known as \u201cDisneybounding,\u201d the phenomenon sees visitors circumvent rules on wearing full Disney costumes (some masks, for instance, are banned\u00a0to avoid any confusion with the parks\u2019 own costumed employees) by using clothing and accessories that evoke their favorite characters. Qin Wuxiao, dressed from head to toe as Jessie the cowgirl doll from the \u201cToy Story\u201d franchise, was taking photos with her mother in front of the Castle of Magical Dreams. The 23-year-old student said it\u2019s become popular for young people to dress up like characters and post pictures of themselves on Chinese social media apps like Xiaohongshu. Charmy Chan and her friend Yanni Chung dressed for the day as Officer Judy Hops and Nick Wilde from \u201cZootopia.\u201d The Hong Kong Baptist University students grew up watching Disney movies and now that they\u2019re in college they find themselves with more time to visit. \u201cWe usually come to the park once a month,\u201d said Chan, in front of the park\u2019s bakery on Main Street USA.  And at Hong Kong Disneyland, Disney characters aren\u2019t the sole fashion inspiration for dedicated fans. All around the park, there were guests like 27-year-old Li Mengru from China\u2019s Fujian province and 16-year-old Chen Xinyu from Guangdong province, dressed as Lolitas.  Not a Nabokovian Lolita, but women who dress in an unabashedly feminine style of clothing popularized in Japan in the mid-1990s. Think petticoats, dainty shoes and accessories. Li wore a light baby blue dress with statement bows and elaborate crystal nails, while Chen went with a more gothic look. Linda Lee, meanwhile, wore a bold striped black and white dress adorned with cherries and red ribbons. In the age of Instagram and TikTok, the park lends a perfect background for Disneybounders and cosplayers to immerse themselves in a fantasy world. There\u2019s the World of Frozen that opened in November last year, where influencers can be found taking photos in front of a snowflake fountain on the streets of Arendelle. Tomorrowland lends itself as a futuristic backdrop for Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans while Toy Story Land with its outsize wooden blocks, green army men and race cars make for some playful shots. A sweet escape Since the pandemic, the city \u2013 which imposed some of the world\u2019s strictest travel restrictions \u2013 has been looking to boost tourism numbers by launching a \u201cHello Hong Kong\u201d campaign, that included giving away free flights. Though most visitors to the park are local residents, the majority government-owned Disneyland Resort is one of the key attractions being promoted to tourists. The Hong Kong Tourism Board\u2019s exit survey of around 93,000 people in 2023 showed the park was the third most visited attraction in the city. The shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui and scenic spot The Peak were the two top spots respectively. Many of the non-local visitors to Hong Kong Disneyland live in mainland China or countries in Southeast Asia like the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore, with some coming from Japan and South Korea as well. Wandering into Adventureland from Grizzly Gulch, 34-year-old Kris Yang and 35-year-old Jimmy Redinger stopped to chat with CNN.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s crazy about Disney,\u201d said Yang who is from mainland China of his partner, who is from the United States. The two primary school teachers were visiting from the northern Chinese province of Hebei. They wore shirts from \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cHercules\u201d and were decked out in Disney paraphernalia. \u201cIf you like my outfit today, you should have seen me yesterday,\u201d said Redinger who proudly identified himself as a \u201cDisney adult,\u201d a term that might come with some baggage in the United States, given some of the extremes fans have gone viral for. \u201cI was in a full Goofy movie get-up.\u201d \u201cI embrace the idea of a \u2018Disney adult\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s in the name. Adults who love Disney. Someone who really has that connection to the company and parks.\u201d In Asia, the penchant for child-like things as adults broadly carries less social stigma than in the West. China\u2019s \u201cmeng\u201d and Japan\u2019s \u201ckawaii\u201d cultures embrace cuteness. Many, like 37-year-old Mariko Otomo kitted out in Disney accessories, were there as a form of escape. \u201cUsually we work very hard. We go office and back, office and back,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we finally come to Disney we forget the daily stuff.\u201d \u201cEven just walking here, (I) have a good feeling,\u201d said Ankh Wong a 24-year-old saleswoman who has visited the park more than 20 times over the past six years. As soon as she got her first job, she bought a ticket to the park. \u201cIt\u2019s a place for happiness and I can put down my worries,\u201d said 16-year-old Deng Chundan. Tactics like themed staycations and special events, collaborations with brands like Le Creuset, Godiva and local jeweler Chow Tai Fook and cultivating successful franchises such as Duffy and Friends are part of the park\u2019s strategy to appeal to Gen Z and millennials. In recent years, the park has invested a reported $1.4 billion in expanding some of its attractions, which included a new \u201cFrozen\u201d themed section of the park. (\u201cFrozen\u201d which came out in 2013, is likely one of the first Disney films Gen Z would have watched as children). Disney declined CNN\u2019s request for information on the ages of its annual visitors, but it\u2019s clear the Hong Kong park draws many grown up fans. Redinger said nostalgia brings him back time and time again. \u201cAs the parks grow, we grow with the parks, reliving that time with our families (that) we had.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/style/hong-kong-disneyland-dress-up-disneybound-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_europe_ukraine-thwarts-coup-attempt-intl-hnk", "text": "Ukraine has foiled an alleged plot to overthrow the government that \u201cwould have played into Russia\u2019s hands,\u201d security officials in the war-torn country said Monday. In a Telegram post, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed the plot organizers planned to trigger\u00a0a riot\u00a0in Kyiv on June 30 as a distraction to seize control of the Ukrainian parliament and remove the military and political leadership from power. It is unclear\u00a0how viable the planned plot was, or\u00a0if those accused have any connection with Russia, which has waged a devastating full-scale invasion against its southwestern neighbor for nearly two and a half years. Four suspects have been identified, with two\u00a0held in custody, the SBU said.\u00a0They\u00a0face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. The SBU said it seized weapons and ammunition, as well as cellphones, computers and other records \u201cwith evidence of criminal action.\u201d The office of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general said the alleged leader of the plot \u201cis\u00a0a head of a non-governmental entity, who already had the experience of participating in fruitless provocative events.\u201d The suspect rented a hall with a capacity of 2,000 people\u00a0and was looking to recruit military personnel and armed guards from private companies to \u201ccarry out the seizure\u201d\u00a0of\u00a0parliament, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. It is unclear if authorities are seeking any more suspects. \u201cTo implement the criminal plan, the main organizer involved several accomplices\u2014representatives of the community organizations from Kyiv, Dnipro, and other regions,\u201d the SBU said. The alleged scheme in Kyiv comes as Russia has made slow but steady battlefield gains in recent months, exploiting Ukraine\u2019s diminishing manpower and\u00a0reliance on the West for weapons\u00a0\u2013 and uncertainty over the future of that military aid. Russian forces killed seven people, including three children, in a missile strike on the southern town of Vilniansk Saturday, according to Ukrainian officials, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to\u00a0appeal for more long-range weapons. \u201cI am grateful to all partners who are helping. And the decisions we need must be accelerated. Any delay in decisions in this war means losing human lives,\u201d Zelensky wrote on Telegram. Concerns have grown over the future of US military support for Ukraine with the potential for another Donald Trump presidency on the horizon.

{"id": "2024_07_04_uk_uk-election-results-tracker-map-2024-intl", "text": "The tectonic plates of British politics have shifted after Britons resoundingly voted to put an end to 14 years of Conservative rule, and deliver a landslide victory for the Labour Party. Labour\u2019s victory is bigger than the party could have imagined until fairly recently. At the last general election in 2019, it slumped to its worst defeat in more than 80 years and appeared set for a long period in the political wilderness. But the party has since rebuilt itself under the leadership of Keir Starmer, who will now become the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. Under Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post voting system, people in 650 constituencies across the nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have voted to select their member of parliament (MP) to represent the area, producing a flurry of results in the early hours of Friday morning before almost all the results were tallied later that day. The final result of the election will not be announced until Saturday morning, however, due to a recount in the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. A party needs 326 seats to officially win, a milestone that Labour cleared at around 5 a.m. local time on Friday, and the new government will have a commanding majority of more than 170 in the next parliament. Because of its electoral system, Britain can see large discrepancies between the share of seats won by a party and its share of the popular vote. If support for one party \u2013 or antipathy toward another \u2013 is spread fairly evenly across the country, it does not need to win a large share of the popular vote to win a huge majority of seats in parliament. Labour secured its landslide victory even as it won just about a third of the popular vote. The results represent one of the largest swings in British political history, and a stunning defeat for the Conservative Party after 14 years in government, bringing a brutal end to Rishi Sunak\u2019s premiership as his party lost around two-thirds of the 372 seats it was defending. Britain\u2019s traditional third party, the Liberal Democrats, also enjoyed a huge bump, going from just 11 seats won at the 2019 general election to more than 70 \u2013 its best result ever. Nigel Farage\u2019s right-wing, populist Reform UK party won its first five seats and came second in many more, splitting the right-wing vote and contributing to the Conservatives\u2019 losses. Meanwhile, in Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered a dismal night, with its number of seats slumping to just nine from 48 in 2019, as of Friday morning. Elsewhere across the UK, Sinn F\u00e9in became the largest Northern Irish party in parliament, winning seven of the 18 seats there. Its MPs do not take up their seats, as part of the party\u2019s refusal to recognize British sovereignty over Northern Ireland, given that it advocates for reuniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in the south.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/uk/uk-election-results-tracker-map-2024-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair.

{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_fears-election-violence-france-intl", "text": "Concerns are growing about political violence ahead of high-stakes parliamentary elections in France after a series of lawmakers were attacked on the campaign trail this week. French government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot and her team came under attack while canvassing on Wednesday night, the latest in a string of violent incidents involving French lawmakers contesting Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections. Her team isn\u2019t the only one. National Rally politician Marie Dauchy, who is running in the southeastern constituency of Savoie, opted to suspend her campaign after she said was physically assaulted while campaigning at a market. In Cherbourg, a center-right candidate from The Republicans party, Nicolas Conquer, made a formal complaint after he claimed he was assaulted by left-wing campaigners on Monday. Politicians have repeatedly warned that a far-right victory could provoke huge protests in the streets with President Emmanuel Macron going so far as to say \u201ccivil war\u201d may break out if the extreme left or right wins by a large margin in Sunday\u2019s runoff vote. Thevenot, a candidate for reelection from Macron\u2019s Renaissance party, was in her constituency in the Parisian suburbs with members of her team when the group came under attack after attempting to stop a group of youths from defacing posters. Providing an account of the incident to French newspaper Le Parisien, the minister said that although she was not harmed in the attack, her deputy and a member of her campaign team were taken to\u00a0a\u00a0hospital after sustaining injuries. Four people have been taken in for questioning regarding the incident, Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin told French television station France 2 on Thursday morning. Thevenot has vowed to continue campaigning, saying in a post on X on Thursday that \u201cviolence is never the answer.\u201d Politicians from across the political divide came out quickly to condemn the attack and send a strong warning regarding election-related violence. Jordan Bardella, the leader of the far-right National Rally (RN) party, sent his \u201ccomplete support\u201d to Thevenot following the attack, calling for \u201ccalm and appeasement.\u201d \u201cFor several weeks now, we have seen a multiplication of violence in the streets linked to the electoral campaign,\u201d Bardella told CNN\u2019s French affiliate BFMTV on Wednesday evening. Acknowledging that violence has been linked to both the far-right and far-left camps, Bardella vowed, if appointed, to be a prime minister who \u201cre-establishes order\u201d in France. Incumbent Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who is fighting to retain his seat, also denounced the attack on Wednesday, saying \u201cviolence and intimidation have no place\u201d in France\u2019s democracy. An additional 30,000 police officers and gendarmes will be deployed across France on Sunday night in the event of public disorder, Darmanin said Thursday. Darmanin said the beefed-up policing would ensure that neither the far right or far left \u201cprofit from the results\u201d and succeed in inciting violence. RN, the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, led the first round of\u00a0France\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary elections on Sunday, taking it closer to the gates of power than ever before. After an unusually high turnout, the RN bloc clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second with 27.99% and Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published by the Interior Ministry on Monday. While the RN appears on track to win the most seats in the National Assembly, it may fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, suggesting France may be heading for a hung parliament and more political uncertainty. Correction: A previous version of this story gave the wrong location for where the candidate made the complaint.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_labours-landslide-victory-is-a-personal-triumph-for-keir-starmer-intl", "text": "The Labour Party\u2019s resounding victory in the UK general election marks a historic moment in modern British political history and a huge personal triumph for Keir Starmer, the Labour leader who will become the country\u2019s next prime minister. Starmer\u2019s victory, with a three-figure majority in parliament, is all the more remarkable considering the journey that Labour has been on since the last general election in 2019. Then, the party suffered its worst loss in a generation under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who stood on a hard-left platform. A path back to credibility and even being competitive in a general election looked potentially a decade off, as the Conservatives emerged triumphant from the carnage of Brexit under the charismatic leadership of Boris Johnson. Johnson not only defeated his political rivals, but completely upended the norms of British politics. Under his leadership, his party won seats in traditional working-class Labour areas once deemed out of reach to Conservatives. For a year at least,\u00a0he seemed untouchable. It was in this context that Starmer took control of a broken Labour Party on April 4, 2020. On that day, David Lammy, one of his Labour colleagues, took him to one side and warned Starmer: \u201cSet yourself a 10-year cycle. You might just lose the next election, and then you can go again.\u201d According to Lammy, Starmer smiled and said \u201cNo, I can do this in five.\u201d Even Starmer could not have predicted what would happen between the end of 2021 and Thursday night. The Conservatives succumbed to repeated self-inflicted wounds, beginning with the \u201cpartygate\u201d scandal, when Downing Street staff held illegal gatherings while the rest of the country was under strict Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns. Johnson would cling to power until the summer of 2022 despite what seemed like daily calls to resign. His successor Liz Truss would propose unfunded tax cuts that threw the economy into turmoil and forced her to resign after just 49 days in power. Rishi Sunak would replace her at the end of 2022, but by that point, most in the Conservative Party had accepted it was over. During that time, Starmer stood his ground and dragged Labour firmly into the center ground of British politics with moderate policies designed not to spook Conservative voters. Critics within his party say that he has not offered an exciting enough program for government. They fear that Starmer\u2019s moderate policies of fiscal responsibility and mild manners won\u2019t enthuse voters and that five years from now, at the time of the next election, he could fall foul of a right-wing populist surge. Their fears might not be unfounded: one of the main sub-plots of the night was the surge of the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by the only Brexiteer more famous than Johnson and noted friend of Donald Trump, Nigel Farage. There has for months been a working assumption that a Starmer victory would be in part thanks to a general disdain for the Conservatives after 14 years in power. Farage\u2019s return to frontline politics during the election campaign meant that the right-wing vote would split further, helping Starmer come through the middle in key seats and secure an even more comfortable majority. In other words, Starmer\u2019s victory might not immediately mean public support for him personally or any great enthusiasm for Labour\u2019s legislative agenda. That could become a problem once he gets his feet under the desk. It has been clear for a long time that the public wanted change more than anything else. For all these reasons, it is reasonable to say that this win is not without its caveats. The populist threat is real, the Conservative Party is far from crushed and Labour\u2019s majority is not as large as some polls had predicted in the days before the election. Starmer will not be worrying too much about this for now. He is heading for a parliamentary majority so large that he will be able to push through his agenda with ease, and he will have the full mechanics of the state to help him govern. It is a level of power that seemed out of reach for any Labour leader, least of all a boring lawyer, not so long ago. And after 14 years in the wilderness, that will be enough for many in Labour for now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/labours-landslide-victory-is-a-personal-triumph-for-keir-starmer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ.

The storm is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica on Wednesday and impact the Cayman Islands on Thursday, where a hurricane watch has been issued. The storm continues to smash records as it kicks off an exceptionally early hurricane season as the earliest Category 5 hurricane \u2013 and only the second Atlantic storm of such strength to be recorded in July. Beryl alarming strengthening has been fed by\u00a0abnormally warm ocean waters driven by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. It took only\u00a0minutes for Beryl to tear through Grenada on Monday, blasting through buildings and knocking out power and phone service to almost all of the island\u2019s residents, the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cIn half an hour, Carriacou was flattened,\u201d Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Monday. A path of \u201cimmense destruction, pain (and) suffering\u201d was torn through the neighboring nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where at least one person has been reported dead, said Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves. Parts of the islands, including hospitals, have no electricity and others are without water. About 90% of the homes on the nation\u2019s Union Island are damaged or destroyed, Gonsalves said. Hundreds more homes and several schools, churches and government buildings in St. Vincent also sustained severe damage. \u201cTomorrow we get up with our commitment and conviction to rebuild our lives and our families\u2019 lives,\u201d Gonsalves said Monday night. Though Beryl is likely to fluctuate in strength in the coming days, it is expected to remain an \u201cextremely dangerous major hurricane\u201d \u2013 Category 3 or stronger \u2013 through mid-week, the hurricane center said. The hurricane will continue packing strong winds, torrential rain and hazardous seas extending well beyond its center over much of the Caribbean. Even if Beryl doesn\u2019t make landfall in Jamaica, its outer bands will bring significant impacts. The latest on Beryl \u2022 Jamaica braces for severe impacts: A hurricane warning is in place for Jamaica, where hurricane conditions will impact the island on Wednesday. Tropical storm-force winds are expected earlier in the day on Wednesday. Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels and rainfall of 4 to 8 inches with isolated totals up to 12 inches is forecast. \u2022 Dominican Republic and Haiti under storm warnings: The southern coasts of Haiti and Dominican Republic remain under tropical storm warnings, with tropical storm conditions beginning Tuesday. Storm surge up to 3 feet is possible, and rainfall totals could reach 6 inches. \u2022 Extended state of emergency in Grenada: The order has been extended until July 7 due to the severe damage wrought by the storm, said Neila K. Ettienne, spokesperson for the prime minister\u2019s office. About 95% of the island of Grenada has lost power, she said. Telecommunications are also down and some individuals have lost internet service. \u2022 St. Vincent and Grenadines rush to restore power: Local authorities are \u201cworking feverishly, urgently and with great focus to get electricity in certain places tonight,\u201d Prime Minister Gonsalves said Monday. Many trees have collapsed on power lines. Even so, government buildings will reopen Tuesday and the prime minister urged business owners to open, if possible. \u2022 Huge blow to Barbados fishing industry: Though Barbados was spared from the brunt of the storm, large storm surge damaged numerous fishing vessels \u2013 a massive loss to the nation\u2019s fishing industry. At least 20 vessels have sunken, Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley said Monday. Some fishermen at the Bridgetown Fisheries Complex watched helplessly as violent waves slammed boats into each other or pulled them underwater, CNN affiliate CBC reports. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do than stand and watch total destruction \u2013 our livelihood gone down the drain,\u201d one resident told CBC. \u2022 Cricket team and fans stranded: Some cricket fans who had traveled to Barbados for the T20 World Cup \u2013 and even the winning Indian team itself \u2013 have been unable to leave the island as Hurricane Beryl forced the Grantley Adams International Airport to suspend operations. But the Indian team is likely to make its way home Tuesday after the airport\u2019s planned reopening, Mottley said.  Kicking off a far from normal hurricane season Beryl has shattered numerous records and is a troubling indicator that this season will be far from normal in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. On Sunday it became the earliest\u00a0major hurricane \u2013 defined as one that is Category 3 or higher \u2013 in the Atlantic in 58 years and the only one to reach Category 4 status in the month of June. It is also the strongest known hurricane to pass through the southern Windward Islands, which lie at the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea, according to data from NOAA that goes back to 1851. The hurricane was able to churn to life because the ocean is as warm now as it would normally be at the peak of hurricane season, said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and science advisor at nonprofit First Street Foundation. \u201cHurricanes don\u2019t know what month it is, they only know what their ambient environment is,\u201d Kossin told CNN. \u201cBeryl is breaking records for the month of June because Beryl thinks it\u2019s September.\u201d The ocean warm ocean temperatures fueling Beryl\u2019s unprecedented strengthening \u201ccertainly have a human fingerprint on them,\u201d Kossin said.

{"id": "2024_07_04_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-talks-hamas-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations to try and broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, an Israeli official and a source familiar with the negotiations said. The decision signals that Israel and Hamas are entering a new phase of negotiations that could produce a final deal within a matter of weeks, if successful. Israel and Hamas on Thursday both appeared inclined to underplay the latest developments in written statements, with people involved in the talks expressing cautious optimism. For months, Israel and Hamas have engaged in mediated negotiations focused on trying to reach a framework agreement, intentionally leaving key details \u2014 such as the identity of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for hostages \u2014 \u00a0aside as they worked to hammer out a framework. The breakthrough in the talks came earlier this week after the United States proposed new language for two key clauses (8 and 14) focused on the scope and sequencing of negotiations set to take place during the first phase of the agreement in order to unlock the second phase of the deal. Hamas broadly agreed with the new language, unlocking detailed negotiations following Netanyahu\u2019s approval. Mossad Director David Barnea, who has led Israel\u2019s negotiating team, is set to lead the negotiating delegation for the new round of detailed talks, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said. Talks are expected to be held in Doha, Qatar, starting as early as Friday, according to a senior Biden administration official. The Mossad director is expected to meet with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani for discussions aiming to bring the parties closer to a deal in Gaza, according to a source with knowledge of the talks. Those negotiations are expected to last two to three weeks, the Israeli source said, to resolve issues such as the identities of Palestinian prisoners to be released, the exact ratio of prisoners to hostages and the technical sequencing of the releases. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau,\u00a0told CNN,\u00a0\u201cthere is nothing official about an effective agreement for ceasefire. The enemy\u2019s media are talking about sending a delegation to Egypt,\u00a0but there is nothing official or any details. Negotiations did not start yet.\u201d \u201cWe are also waiting for a positive response from the Israeli side, which will initiate negotiations into details of the deal,\u201d Naim added. \u201cWe have no information about any delegation visiting Cairo.\u201d Netanyahu spoke Thursday with US President Joe Biden to discuss the progress in the negotiations and the Israeli Cabinet was set to meet Thursday evening. The call focused on the details of the hostage and ceasefire deal, the senior Biden administration official said, adding that there seems to be a \u201cpretty significant opening\u201d for the hostage deal to be agreed upon by all the involved groups. When asked if the administration believes that Netanyahu is playing politics and could try to sabotage the deal, the official said that the deal is structured in a way that \u201cfully protects Israel\u2019s interests.\u201d The official added that Biden will have the opportunity to talk about the deal with other world leaders next week during the NATO summit, which will be held in Washington, DC.

{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_jordan-bardella-national-rally-france-profile-intl", "text": "Jordan Bardella\u2019s rise to the peak of French politics has been so swift he is still asked about his teenage years spent playing \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d Next week, at the age of just 28, he could become France\u2019s prime minister \u2013 and Europe\u2019s youngest for more than 200 years. He\u2019s the fresh face of an old party that has striven to make itself new. Handpicked as leader by National Rally (RN) doyenne Marine Le Pen in an effort to purge the far-right party of its racist and antisemitic roots, Bardella has taken it closer to the gates of power than ever before. On Sunday, the RN smashed President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance in the first round of a snap parliamentary election. Whether the RN forms a government and Bardella becomes prime minister after the July 7 runoff is not clear. Despite the surge in support for the RN, France\u2019s left and centrist parties have called on their supporters to vote tactically to deny the far right an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. This week, more than 200 parliamentary candidates from Macron\u2019s alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) stepped down in a bid to avoid splitting the vote in the second round. But as Paris wraps a week of political bargaining, one thing is clear: France \u2013 and the rest of Europe \u2013 must reckon with the prospect of a far-right French government, headed by a popular but untested leader. So, who is Bardella, and what might his party do in power? The only child of Italian immigrants, Bardella was brought up in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb of Paris. He joined the RN at 16, and later began a geography degree at the prestigious Sorbonne university, before dropping out to climb the party ranks. He did so briskly. After becoming party spokesperson, he became the RN\u2019s lead candidate for the 2019 European Parliament election at the age of just 23. In 2022, after Le Pen narrowly lost the presidential election to Macron, he succeeded her as party leader, leapfrogging the party\u2019s long standing vice-president and Le Pen\u2019s former partner, Louis Aliot. Freed from the day-to-day management of the party, but almost certain to run again for the presidency in 2027, Le Pen has been able to freshen the RN\u2019s image and untether it from its reputation. Le Pen began her yearslong effort to detoxify the RN by ousting her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2013 a convicted Holocaust denier \u2013 from the party he founded, and later changing its name. The appointment and subsequent rise of Bardella may represent the completion of her mission to bring the party into the modern age. For many older voters, the prospect of a far-right government \u2013 reminiscent of the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II \u2013 remains terrifying. But among young people, not weighed down by this historical baggage, the party has proved hugely popular. While the RN\u2019s messaging has remained similar, the messenger has changed entirely. Suave, composed, unflappable, a child of the screen generation, Bardella has built up a huge TikTok following, where young voters can watch him tasting wine and doing shots. Even a video of him eating a bon-bon has been viewed 7.5 million times. In just two years, Bardella has helped to give the RN an acceptable \u2013 and potentially electable \u2013 face. Whereas Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance has sought to distance itself from the president\u2019s image, the RN\u2019s election manifesto is filled with splashy portraits of the prime minister-in-waiting. Fantasy promises? But campaigning and governing require different skills. If he becomes prime minister, Bardella will face the problem common to parties that make the leap from protest vote to credible governing force: How, after making extravagant promises as they rail against the mainstream, to avoid disappointing people once in office? Despite its freshened image, its decades-old philosophy remains the same: Immigrants threaten France\u2019s social fabric. The RN is committed to abolishing the birthright to citizenship for children of foreigners born on French soil, and to discriminate in favor of French citizens in welfare and public employment. But on other things in its 21-page manifesto, the RN is more vague. Detailing how it intends to \u201cpreserve French civilization,\u201d it says it will enact \u201cspecific legislation targeting Islamist ideologies,\u201d without elaborating, and that it will \u201cexperiment with the creation of a voluntary national heritage service.\u201d But already, the RN has begun to temper some of its more extreme nativist positions. After initially advocating to ban dual-citizenship, Bardella softened this stance, but maintained that \u201cthe most strategic positions\u201d within government will be reserved for French citizens. \u201cCan you imagine Franco-Russians working at the Ministry of the Armed Forces today?\u201d he said ahead of the first round. But the party has not yet provided a definition of \u201cstrategic positions.\u201d Could, for instance, the Spanish-born Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo remain in post, or would she have to renounce her Spanish citizenship? Mocking the vagueness of the RN\u2019s pledges, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon \u2013 the far-left leader of the France Unbowed party, which belongs to the New Popular Front coalition \u2013 has asked: \u201cWhat does Mr. Bardella want? We don\u2019t know. He says nothing. He\u2019s a good-looking guy, but what\u2019s his program? Throwing immigrants into the sea.\u201d Critics have said Bardella\u2019s chronic absence from key votes while he was a member of the European Parliament, and his lack of grasp of policy details, make him unfit to govern. In a recent debate with Gabriel Attal, the outgoing French prime minister and Macron\u2019s protege, Bardella confessed, with a smirk, to not having read the text of a bill he had voted against. On the economy, the RN has pledged to slash value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products from 20% to 5.5% and suspend it entirely for scores of basic necessities. While this may be appealing to voters, it has alarmed both Brussels and the financial markets. France is running one of the highest deficits in the eurozone and now risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules, which had been suspended to help countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. French government spending could soon be brutally constrained by Brussels, despite the lavish promises of the RN. \u201cTightening will be necessary next year, to bring France into compliance with EU expectations and rules,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at political risk consultancy the Eurasia Group, told CNN. If the RN falls short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, Bardella might choose not to govern. In bullish speeches before the first-round vote, he ruled out leading a minority government, which would require the support of allied parties to pass laws. While France might escape a far-right government for now, it faces the growing prospect of Le Pen becoming president in 2027, and then calling parliamentary elections to see Bardella installed as prime minister. The Meloni model? Since 2022, formerly fringe nativist parties hoping to govern have found a model to follow. After the technocratic government led by Mario Draghi collapsed in Italy, triggering a snap election, Giorgia Meloni became Italian prime minister, becoming the country\u2019s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini. Before she took office, Rome\u2019s allies thought a hard-right Italian government could compromise Western unity on support for Ukraine, pointing to Matteo Salvini, Meloni\u2019s deputy prime minister and a longtime admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin who used to don T-shirts emblazoned with his image. But Meloni\u2019s premiership has proven more moderate than many feared at the outset. While she has pursued hard-right policies domestically \u2013 seeking to limit abortion, surrogacy and even removing lesbian mothers\u2019 names from their children\u2019s birth certificates \u2013 she has largely toed a mainstream line on foreign policy issues. Might the RN adopt this bifurcated strategy? The RN is notoriously euroskeptic, but talk of a \u201cFrexit\u201d has cooled - perhaps because Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union proved an act of serious economic self-harm, and perhaps because hard-right leaders \u2013 like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban \u2013 have shown it is easier to weaken the bloc from the inside than from without. With that aim, the RN has promised to cut funding to the EU by up to 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion), partly to fund tax cuts at home. But, with EU budgets agreed on a seven-year basis and the current one running until 2027, the RN cannot legally renege on France\u2019s spending commitments. Bardella has also ruled out sending French troops to Ukraine \u2013 an idea floated by Macron \u2013 and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. But a Bardella premiership could tip France into a constitutional crisis. While the National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws and the prime minister controls the budget, the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the prime minister and president belong to different parties \u2013 in a rare arrangement known as \u201ccohabitation\u201d \u2013 things can grind to a halt. With Macron set to see out his term, which finishes in 2027, the line between domestic and foreign issues may become blurred. If Macron pursues a foreign policy that requires parliament to pass large spending bills, it is not clear whose preferences would prevail: his or Bardella\u2019s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/jordan-bardella-national-rally-france-profile-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_style_cambodia-statue-repatriation-met-museum", "text": "The return to Cambodia this week of 14 sculptures looted from the country during a period of war and unrest is like welcoming home the souls of ancestors, Cambodia\u2019s culture minister, Phoeurng Sackona, said Thursday. The items repatriated from New York\u2019s\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art arrived Wednesday and were displayed to journalists and VIPs on Thursday at the National Museum in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. They \u201cwere made between the 9th and 14th centuries in the Angkorian period and reflect the Hindu and Buddhist religious systems prevailing at that time,\u201d the museum said in a statement. A statement from Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts said the \u201chistoric homecoming of national treasures\u201d followed several years of negotiations between Cambodia\u2019s art restitution team, United States federal prosecutors in New York, investigators from the US Department of Homeland Security and the Metropolitan Museum. The culture minister added that the return of the artifacts was very important to the Cambodian people for recalling the heritage of their ancestors through good times and bad. \u201cThe pieces were staying a long, long time abroad, but today they returned to Cambodia, like a blessing for our people for peace, stability in our country now,\u201d said Sackona, adding that to Cambodians, the returned artworks carry with them the souls of their ancestors. Bringing back the souls of ancestors also includes bringing history, admiration and knowledge, she explained, noting that Cambodia hopes to soon receive another 50 artifacts from the US. Cambodia claims that other items illegally trafficked from the country are still at the Metropolitan Museum, as well as at other museums and in the hands of private collectors. \u201cThese returns contribute to the reconciliation and healing of the Cambodian people, who endured decades of civil war and suffered tremendously from the tragedy of the Khmer Rouge regime,\u201d Sackona said. \u201cThey also demonstrate the truly positive partnership we have developed with the United States.\u201d For the art world, their return is the fruit of a reckoning in recent years over art and archaeological treasures taken from their homelands. These include not only ancient Asian artworks, but also pieces lost or stolen during turmoil in other places, such as Syria, Iraq and Nazi-occupied Europe. The pieces returned to Cambodia from the Met were looted during a long period of civil war and instability in Cambodia, which was ruled by the brutal communist\u00a0Khmer Rouge regime\u00a0in the 1970s. They were bought and trafficked by well-known art dealer Douglas Latchford, who was indicted in 2019 for allegedly orchestrating a multiyear scheme to sell looted Cambodian antiquities on the international art market. Latchford, who died the following year, had denied any involvement in smuggling. Cambodia\u2019s Culture Ministry highlighted two works among those returned that are expected to be restored by reuniting them with other parts already in their possession. The repatriation includes the \u201cextraordinary\u201d stone sculpture from the 10th century of the female goddess Uma from the ancient royal capital of Koh Ker, it said, adding that the sculpture\u2019s foot had already been retrieved from its original site. \u201cAt last, the Uma can be reunified to achieve its full magnificence as one complete statue,\u201d it said. \u201cMoreover, a significant returned artifact is a 10th century bronze head of the deity Avalokiteshvara, which the Ministry highly anticipates finally being reunited with its matching torso, currently on display at the National Museum of Cambodia.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/style/cambodia-statue-repatriation-met-museum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_asia_putin-xi-russia-china-alignment-sco-astana-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday urged regional leaders to resist \u201cexternal interference\u201d at a gathering of a Eurasian security bloc touted by Beijing and Moscow as a counterbalance to Western power. Addressing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)\u2019s annual leaders\u2019 summit in Kazakhstan, Xi called on member states to \u201cconsolidate the power of unity\u201d in the face of \u201cthe real challenge of interference and division.\u201d \u201cWe should work together to resist external interference \u2026 and firmly grasp our own future and destiny, as well as regional peace and development, in our own hands,\u201d Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. The 10-member bloc must handle internal differences with peace, seek common ground, and resolve difficulties in cooperation,\u00a0Xi\u00a0added. Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years as Beijing and Moscow drive a transformation of the bloc from a regional security club with a focus on Central Asia to a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies. On Thursday, Belarus, a staunch Russian ally that helped Moscow launch its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, became the latest authoritarian state to join the SCO, after Iran\u00a0became a full member\u00a0last year. The bloc underwent its first expansion in 2017 to welcome India and Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was notably absent from this year\u2019s event, further adding to the perception of the SCO\u2019s anti-Western orientation. At the summit, Xi warned against what he called \u201cthe real threat of Cold War mentality\u201d and called on member states to \u201cuphold our security baseline.\u201d He also urged countries to safeguard the right to development in the face of the \u201creal risks of small yards with high fences,\u201d referring to a strategy adopted by the US to restrict key technologies from China. The Chinese leader stressed the need to jointly promote scientific and technological innovation, and to maintain the stability and smoothness of industrial and supply chains. China-Russia alignment On the eve of the summit, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 the two leaders driving the SCO\u2019s expansion \u2013 met on the sidelines and hailed their countries\u2019 deepening alignment. In opening remarks ahead of their bilateral meeting, Putin said Russia-China relations are going through \u201cthe best period in their history\u201d and should be considered a \u201cstabilizing\u201d force for the world. \u201cRussian-Chinese cooperation in\u00a0global affairs serves as\u00a0a\u00a0main stabilizing factor on\u00a0the\u00a0international stage, and\u00a0we continue to\u00a0further enhance it,\u201d Putin told Xi on Wednesday. The Russian president also underscored Moscow and Beijing\u2019s roles \u201cat the cradle\u201d of the SCO\u2019s founding and noted its rapid expansion in recent years. \u201cAs\u00a0the\u00a0number of\u00a0participants grew \u2026 the\u00a0SCO also gained a\u00a0bigger role as\u00a0one of\u00a0the\u00a0key pillars of\u00a0a\u00a0just multipolar world order,\u201d Putin said. The meeting\u00a0marks the two leaders\u2019 second face-to-face talks in just two months following\u00a0Putin\u2019s visit to Beijing\u00a0in May and comes shortly after the Russian president struck\u00a0a landmark defense pact\u00a0with North Korea. Much to the consternation of the US and Europe, China and Russia have\u00a0deepened their political, economic and military ties\u00a0since Putin and Xi declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership in February 2022 when the Russian leader visited Beijing, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China has surpassed the European Union to become Russia\u2019s top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its heavily sanctioned economy. The two\u00a0nuclear-armed neighbors have also continued to hold joint military exercises, including with Iran. Meanwhile, the US has accused China of providing Russia with dual-use goods that bolster the warring nation\u2019s military industrial complex as it attacks Ukraine, which Beijing denies. In his opening remarks Wednesday, Xi told Putin that China and Russia should \u201ckeep upholding the original aspiration\u201d of their \u201clasting friendship\u201d in the face of \u201can international situation fraught with turbulence and changes.\u201d Xi also hailed the \u201cunique value\u201d in China-Russia relations, urging the two countries to make new efforts to safeguard their \u201clegitimate rights and interests\u201d and \u201cthe basic norms governing international relations.\u201d \u201cChina and Russia should continue to strengthen comprehensive strategic coordination, oppose external interference and jointly safeguard regional tranquility and stability,\u201d Xi said, according to a\u00a0readout\u00a0from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry.

{"id": "2024_07_05_travel_van-life-travel-cec-wellness", "text": "Home is where you are. Home is where you make it. Home on the range. Home is \u2026 in a camper van? Absolutely! When I tried camper van life for the first time, I went all in. For three weeks, my husband and I drove a kitted-out, circa 2012 Ford Econoline van across North America, traveling from northern New Jersey to Los Angeles as we wound our way along the length of Route 66 in November 2019. It was a bold move, but I knew it was the most cost-efficient and efficient-efficient way to see as much of \u201cthe Mother Road\u201d as we could. My hope was that by renting a camper van, we\u2019d save money on purchased meals and hotel rooms and also feel more immersed in the journey and deeply connected to each town we visited. Our first night in the Bloomington, Illinois, Walmart parking lot was a little nerve-racking. I lay in my sleeping bag, listening to the activity beyond the van and wondering if we could handle this adventure. But after the first successful sleepover, we quickly settled into a routine. We\u2019d wake up each morning for a quick bathroom run and even shower at some of the surprisingly luxurious recreational vehicle parks we patronized. Then we\u2019d cook breakfast on our camp stove at the rear of the van and hit the road by 8:30 or 9 a.m. After a day covering roughly 130 miles and experiencing the historic sites, local museums, former filling stations and proudly kitschy roadside attractions along Route 66, we\u2019d make sure to arrive at our nightly destination by 4:30 p.m. \u2014 sundown in November comes early. By the time we dropped off the van near Los Angeles International Airport in late November, I felt like I was saying goodbye to a new but dear friend on the last day of summer camp. We\u2019d unwind, explore the sights of the town, treat ourselves to dinner away from the van, then bunk down in our sleeping bags and do it all again the next day. (We spent two-thirds of the trip sleeping in the van and the other third in historic lodgings along the route, such as Boots Court in Carthage, Missouri, and the El Rancho in Gallup, New Mexico.) The benefits of camper van travel Now, I\u2019m not saying you must spend weeks on an epic road trip to fully experience the joy of a camper van. And I\u2019m certainly not saying you need to sell all your possessions and become a full-time van lifer \u2014 I\u2019m grateful to return to my house and my cats after every trip. But even a few days of traveling and living in a camper van can give you a whole new perspective on yourself and the world around you. When you\u2019re in a camper van, everything you need is within reach \u2014 to an extent. I loved the challenge of condensing our lives into approximately 75 square feet and finding creative ways to live comfortably but efficiently. The morning coffee? It\u2019s right there. Your outfit for the day? Just reach behind you. If you need to change your shoes into hiking boots, grab a raincoat for an unexpected downpour, refuel with a quick snack or recharge with a 20-minute power nap, you don\u2019t need to go far. And you don\u2019t have to repack your bags to leave a hotel every morning. After the first night, I embraced the security and sanctuary of the van, knowing that whatever we had was around us. If we couldn\u2019t find it right away, it wasn\u2019t lost. We had exactly everything we needed \u2014 everything except, well, a bathroom, which brings me to the next life-changing aspect of a camper van. Camper van life makes you brave and gets you out there, interacting with others and connecting with the world. You\u2019re always in the environment, not separated by hotel corridors and lobbies. You\u2019re discovering creative places to stay for the night, looking forward to chatting with bartenders during the nightly dinner at a local restaurant or just fielding questions from strangers about the van and your trip. During our Route 66 adventure, our van prompted exchanges and allowed us to have moments we would likely have missed in a rental car. In Arcadia, Oklahoma, we stopped by Pops 66 Soda Ranch and struck up a conversation with a woman admiring our brightly painted camper van. She told us about one of the chairs at the nearby Oklahoma City National Memorial representing a boy named Zackary who loved collecting pennies. The next morning, we found Zackary\u2019s chair and placed a penny on it for him. Because the van functioned as a full campsite rig, we didn\u2019t have to figure out the logistics of bringing or renting equipment to camp in Joshua Tree National Park in California. We spent two nights in wonder among the granite boulders, with Cassiopeia shining brightly above, and two mornings waking up with the sun and the scent of high desert air. Tips for trying the van life Ready to try camper van travel? Companies rent vans that come fully equipped with mini kitchens and bedding, so it\u2019s almost as easy as booking an Airbnb. Some even come with toilets and showers, so that doesn\u2019t have to be a deal-breaker. Rent one for a quick round-trip weekend visit or explore further by taking a one-way jaunt to another rental hub and then flying home. If you\u2019re itching to have a new type of travel experience, you\u2019ll find it behind the rolling door of a camper van. As another well-loved saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey\u201d \u2014 but with a camper van, you\u2019ll get to appreciate both at once.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/travel/van-life-travel-cec-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
