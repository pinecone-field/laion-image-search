Mohammad Baraa Qatarji died when the strike hit the car he was traveling in on the al-Saboura highway near Damascus, according to Syrian state-aligned newspaper al-Watan. Qatarji had\u00a0been sanctioned\u00a0in 2018 by the US Treasury\u00a0and was\u00a0on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list for facilitating \u201cshipments of fuel and weapons to the Syrian regime.\u201d According to OFAC, Qatirji and his company had facilitated the\u00a0trade\u00a0in fuel\u00a0between the regime and ISIS and had provided oil products to ISIS-controlled territory. \u201cIn a 2016 trade deal between the government of Syria and ISIS, the Qatirji company was identified as the exclusive agent for providing supplies to ISIS-controlled areas, including oil and other commodities,\u201d OFAC said. According to the US Treasury website,\u00a0Qatarji had\u00a0a strong working relationship with officials within the Syrian government, including in the ministries of oil and trade. Qatarji and his two brothers Zahed and Hussam \u2013 who are also sanctioned by OFAC \u2013 established a militia that fought alongside the Syrian regime in Aleppo in 2016.

Earlier in April, Lebanon\u2019s interior minister said that a Hezbollah-linked Lebanese currency exchanger was abducted and killed in a villa on the edge of a quiet mountain resort town, likely the work of Israeli intelligence operatives.

Despite a 1.4 billion Euro (1.5 billion USD) clean-up plan for the Seine, where swimming has been illegal for\u00a0more than 100 years\u00a0due to pollution levels, concerns remain over the river\u2019s suitability for swimming events. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause\u00a0E. coli\u00a0levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30, following rain the previous day,\u00a0E. coli\u00a0levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge.

The suspect, charged Tuesday, was tasked with posting public notices in Tel Aviv, hiding money in various locations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and delivering packages containing threatening messages, including a severed head of an animal, to the doorsteps of Israeli citizens, and completed the tasks, the Israel Security Agency (ISA) and the police said. The ISA, also known as Shin Bet or Shabak, is Israel\u2019s domestic security agency. Stern was also asked to start a forest fire and kill someone, according to the joint statement, but did not carry out these tasks. The security authorities allege that Stern recruited and paid two additional Israeli citizens to perform some of the tasks. The two other citizens were interrogated and released from custody at the end of their investigation while they await a decision on their case, the authorities said.

Finland has accused neighboring Russia of weaponizing migration by encouraging scores of migrants from countries such as Syria and Somalia to cross the border, an assertion the Kremlin denies. Helsinki believes Moscow is promoting the crossings in retaliation for Finland joining NATO, which backs Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion. The right-wing government of Prime Minister Petteri Orpo has said the bill is vital to stop future arrivals, despite the law being at odds with Finland\u2019s international human rights commitments. \u201cThis is a strong message to Russia, a strong message to our allies, that Finland takes care of its own security, we take care of the security of the EU border,\u201d Orpo told a press conference after the vote. More than 1,300 asylum seekers crossed over from Russia since last summer but there had been no new arrivals since March until Thursday. The Finnish Border Guard released a statement after the parliament vote saying one person had crossed the border illegally on Thursday and when caught by a border guard, applied for asylum. Finland shut its land borders with Russia late last year. Interior Minister Mari Rantanen told the press conference after the bill passed that no decision had been taken on when to re-open the border crossings with Russia. Finland\u2019s move is similar to steps taken in recent years in other European countries, including Poland and Lithuania, to make it more difficult for migrants to cross the border from Russia and Russia-ally Belarus. The Finnish bill was passed with 167 votes in favor, 31 against and one abstention. To pass, the proposal needed a two-thirds majority of given votes in the 200-seat parliament. Orpo urged migrants who were considering coming to Europe through Russia not to embark on the journey. \u201cDon\u2019t go with the smugglers,\u201d he told the news conference. \u201cFinland takes care of its borders.

{"id": "2024_07_16_asia_slave-conditions-indian-workers-italy-intl-latam", "text": "Dozens of Indian nationals held in \u201cslave-like\u201d working conditions near Verona in northern Italy have been freed, a spokesperson for Italy\u2019s financial police told CNN. Thirty-three Indian farm laborers were allegedly forced to work more than 10 hours a day, seven days a week, for wages of around $4 an hour that were sometimes withheld, a statement from the police said. The police spokesperson said they also confiscated more than $500,000 in cash and other assets from two Indian nationals suspected of being the gangmasters. The money is believed to be tied to the alleged \u201csale\u201d of the workers as \u201clow-cost labor,\u201d they said. This comes as Italian authorities were investigating the death of a 31-year-old Indian national who died after his arm was severed in an accident at a fruit farm in June. The 33 freed workers were lured to Italy by Indian \u201cbrokers\u201d who worked with traffickers in promising people legitimate jobs, the spokesperson said. The workers had each paid more than 17,000 euros (around $18,500) for travel and for what turned out to be fake seasonal work permits to enter the country, according to the spokesperson. Many of the workers were charged an additional 13,000 euros (around $14,100) in a promise of permanent work permits, according to the police statement. \u201cTo guarantee their total silence and submission, the two Indian subjects took away the passports of the laborers as soon as they arrived in Italy and imposed on them an absolute ban on leaving the dilapidated \u2018houses\u2019 in which they were forced to live under threat, several times implemented, of physical retaliation in case of refusal,\u201d the police statement said. The identities and genders of the freed workers have not been made public. The financial police said they are now investigating the business relationships the suspected gangmasters had with other entities, including many companies who used the \u201clow-cost labor.\u201d On Saturday, the Indian embassy in Rome said on X that it was \u201caware of media reports about Indian nationals working in agricultural farms in Italy.\u201d \u201cWe are in contact with Italian authorities and the Indian community to ensure safety and well being of Indian nationals,\u201d it added. Italy has a complicated history with labor trafficking. In 2018, the financial police said that at least a quarter of all agriculture related labor was tied to a gangmaster system whereby farm and other labor workers are contracted out by individuals who \u201cown\u201d them. The practice has been illegal since 2016 after a female laborer working under slave-like conditions for little money died. More than 11 percent of all workers in Italy work in the black market, meaning they are not documented even if they are Italian nationals, and neither they nor their employees pay taxes on the salaries, which serves to enable labor trafficking, according to the police spokesperson.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/asia/slave-conditions-indian-workers-italy-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Tens of thousands of students joined nationwide protests for a second day after more than 100 people were\u00a0injured on Monday\u00a0in rallies that blocked major highways and rail links. They are the first significant protests against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s government since she won a fourth straight term in January. The protesters are angry over public sector job quotas, including a 30% quota for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 War of Independence, amid high youth unemployment. Riot police fanned out at university campuses across the country in an effort to quell disturbances. In Rangpur in northwestern\u00a0Bangladesh, the protests turned violent, police told Reuters. \u201cWe had to use rubber bullets and teargas to disperse the unruly students who were hurling stones at us,\u201d Rangpur Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mohammad Moniruzzaman said. \u201cWe heard a protesting student died after he was taken to hospital. It was not immediately clear how he died,\u201d he said. In the capital Dhaka, TV footage showed a heavy presence of police, wearing protective vests and helmets and armed with wooden sticks, outside the Dhaka University campus. One student was found lying in a pool of blood and declared dead at city hospital, police said. Three people, including two students, were killed in the port city of Chittagong. \u201cWe are not sure how they were killed as we didn\u2019t use any force in Chittagong,\u201d local police chief Saiful Islam said. The Border Guard\u00a0Bangladesh\u00a0paramilitary force was deployed across the country to tighten security as clashes continued in several places, the force said. Stagnant job growth in\u00a0Bangladesh\u2019s private sector has made government jobs, which offer regular wage hikes and other privileges, more attractive, said Mohammad Abdur Razzaque, chairman of Research and Policy Integration for Development. Nearly 32 million young\u00a0Bangladeshis are not in work or education, he said. In\u00a0Bangladesh, 56% of government jobs are reserved for various quotas. Ten percent are reserved for women, 10% for people from underdeveloped districts, 5% for indigenous communities and 1% for people with disabilities. Violence erupted on Monday when thousands of anti-quota protesters clashed with members of the student wing of the ruling Awami League party. Protesters have planned more marches and rallies nationwide and demonstrations will continue until their demands are met, said Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the anti-quota protests. Protests began earlier this month when the High Court ordered the government to reinstate the 30% job quota. The Supreme Court suspended the order last week for a month but protests continued and they intensified after Hasina refused to meet the students\u2019 demands, citing ongoing court proceedings. Hasina labeled those opposing the quota as \u201crazakar\u201d \u2013 a term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 war \u2013 prompting more protests.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/asia/bangladesh-protests-quote-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Sunni-Muslim Islamist group said in a statement late on Tuesday that three of its \u201csuicide attackers\u201d fired on worshippers at the mosque and exchanged gunfire with Omani security forces until morning, Reuters reported. The group also published what it said was a video of the attack on the Telegram  messaging app. The incident has shocked a country that avoided the sectarian violence that gripped some Middle Eastern states, including some of Oman\u2019s oil-rich neighbors, after ISIS declared a state in Iraq and Syria a decade ago and sought to expand throughout the Arabian Peninsula. The group considers Shiites heretics. The Royal Oman Police said on Tuesday that nine people were killed in the shooting in the capital Muscat\u2019s Wadi al-Kabir district, including the three perpetrators and a policeman. More than two dozen people of various nationalities were injured, including four Omani first responders, the police said. It didn\u2019t identify a motive for the attack or reveal the identity of the attackers. The attack took place at the Imam Ali mosque, according to video obtained by Reuters and geolocated by CNN, during Ashura, the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram, which holds particular significance for Shiite Muslims. The oil-producing nation is one of the most stable in the Middle East and is becoming an emerging regional tourism destination as the government promotes the sector to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons. Sectarian harmony Unlike the rest of the Sunni-ruled Gulf states, Oman follows the Ibadi sect of Islam but has a sizable Sunni population and a small but influential Shiite minority. Religious and political leaders often emphasize sectarian harmony and religious tolerance as key to the country\u2019s stability. About 57% of the country\u2019s population of five million are expatriates, many of whom are Hindu or Christian. Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday that four Pakistanis were among the dead. Another 30 Pakistanis were injured and currently receiving treatment in hospital, the ministry added. It condemned the incident as a \u201cdastardly terrorist attack.\u201d \u201cWe are heartened that the government of Oman has neutralized the attackers,\u201d the ministry said. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X Tuesday that he had been \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the incident. \u201cMy heart goes out to the families of the victims. I have instructed the Pakistan Embassy in Muscat to extend all possible assistance to the injured and visit the hospitals personally,\u201d he wrote. One Indian citizen was killed and another injured, India\u2019s embassy in Muscat announced in a post on X Tuesday. The US embassy in Muscat issued a security alert for US citizens, advising them to \u201cremain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities.\u201d It said visa appointments scheduled for Tuesday would be canceled as a safety precaution.

{"id": "2024_07_17_weather_summer-heat-temperatures-us-climate", "text": "Heat is normal during the summer, but this year\u2019s has been anything but, and halfway through the season\u2019s hottest month it\u2019s clear this one is for the record books. Hundreds of cities in nearly every US state \u2013 including parts of Alaska and Hawaii \u2013 are on track for one of their 10-warmest summers on record. About 100 of these cities are enduring their hottest start to summer on record. The deadly heat has not been unexpected. Forecasters have been warning of a searing\u00a0summer for months due to the troubling combination of a budding La Ni\u00f1a and a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Last summer was the warmest on record globally and one of the warmest for several states. But so far, this summer has felt even worse for many in the US. Extreme heat has baked almost all of the\u00a0Lower 48 so far this summer, but the worst of it has concentrated in the East Coast states and West. Average daily temperatures \u2013 calculated by taking the average of each day\u2019s high and low \u2013 have soared several degrees above normal for hundreds of cities since June 1. These temperatures are a more complete indicator of how hot the season has been, as they factor in both hotter days and warmer nights. Summer nights in the US have been warming nearly twice as fast as summer days since records began in the late 1800s, according to data from NOAA. Warmer nights increase the danger of heat by compounding heat stress through a reduction in the amount of time the body has to cool down naturally. Las Vegas is experiencing its hottest summer on record and holds the top spot in the entire country. Many of the cities experiencing the most exceptional summer heat are in the West, notably in or near California\u2019s Central Valley. Searing heat there has been relentless since it started in early June. On the opposite coast, a historic mid-June heat wave has only been spelled by brief bouts of relief. Dozens of cities from New England to the Mid-Atlantic are experiencing their hottest start to the summer on record, including Washington, DC, which just smashed a high temperature record Tuesday when it hit 104 degrees. Some of the most abnormal heat in the region is focused in New England and New York state. The\u00a0South has also sweltered under more than its fair share of historic heat so far this summer.\u00a0Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, are both on pace to record their hottest summer on record.\u00a0For some locations in the region, it\u2019s the second consecutive year summer has had a blistering start. Last summer ended up quite warm for the Lower 48, but the worst heat was confined to the Gulf Coast. By mid-July last summer, the season was pacing as one of the warmest on record for cities nearest the coast, including cities like New Orleans, Houston and Brownsville, Texas. But in other parts of the country, last summer was downright cool compared to this year\u2019s extreme heat. Washington, DC, is currently on track to record its hottest summer on record, but it was only the 44th-warmest summer by this time last year. Sacramento, California, is experiencing its hottest start to summer on record. But this time last year California\u2019s capital city was experiencing is 62nd-warmest summer. Forecasts for the rest of the season aren\u2019t cool, either. Despite some upcoming brief periods of respite, much of the Lower 48 is expected to endure above-average temperatures through August and into September, according to the Climate Prediction Center.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/weather/summer-heat-temperatures-us-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_middleeast_mawasi-deif-israel-hamas-gaza-intl", "text": "At least 90 Palestinians have been reported killed in an Israeli strike on a displacement camp in southern Gaza which Israel said targeted Hamas\u2019 military chief, who was an alleged mastermind of the October 7 attacks. Footage from Al-Mawasi, which has been designated as a safe zone for Palestinians fleeing the fighting elsewhere, shows bodies in the street and destroyed tents. A senior staffer at UNRWA, the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, described the Nasser hospital, which took in victims of the strike, as \u201cthe most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.\u201d \u201cI saw toddlers who are double amputees, children paralyzed and unable to receive treatment, and others separated from their parents.\u201d Mohammed Deif \u2013 the leader of Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019 military wing \u2013 was the figure targeted, alongside the head of the Khan Younis brigade, Rafe Salama, an Israeli security official told CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference in Tel Aviv Saturday that he was not certain whether Deif and his deputy had been killed, but said he had given his blessing for the head of Shin Bet \u2013 Israel\u2019s security agency \u2013 to carry out the operation after being assured there were no hostages in the area. The strike left scenes of devastation, with the Gaza Health Ministry reporting at least 90 people killed and 300 people injured. It said women and children accounted for half of those killed and dozens of those injured. CNN has no way of verifying the casualty numbers reported by the ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants killed. The Kuwait and Nasser Hospitals on the ground said they were struggling to cope with the high numbers of dead and injured civilians coming in, the ministry said. \u201cI was sitting in the bathroom, and before I heard explosions from the strike, the bathroom flew off,\u201d a young boy called Hammoud told a CNN stringer on the ground. \u201cThen, the whole area became filled with smoke, and then the shells began to fall.\u201d Hammoud\u2019s young brother was killed in the strike whilst his sister is currently in hospital receiving treatment for her injuries, his family told CNN. Another resident named Aida Hamdi told CNN: \u201cWe suddenly heard missiles hitting. I was baking bread, I took my daughter and we started running outside. \u201cI threw all the dough away, it was mixed with sand. We heard three hits, people around me were martyred, women, men, and children.\u201d Hamas denied Israeli claims it had targeted Deif and Salama, calling the killings a \u201chorrific massacre.\u201d \u201cThe occupation\u2019s claims of targeting leaders are false claims, and this is not the first time the occupation has claimed to target Palestinian leaders, only for its lies to be exposed later,\u201d a statement read. At least one US-made munition was used in the airstrike. In a video shared on social media, CNN identified the tail fin of a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), a Boeing-manufactured GPS-guided kit which can be added to so-called \u2018dumb bombs\u2019 to direct them at a specific target. Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, confirmed the identification of the JDAM tail at the scene for CNN. Similar CNN analysis has found US-made munitions were used in a strike on a school complex near Khan Younis and in other Israeli strikes on Gaza. A shadowy figure Israeli security and intelligence first received intelligence about a potential opportunity to strike Hamas\u2019 top military commander in recent days, but a clear window of opportunity to strike Deif only crystallized in the last 24 hours, an Israeli official said. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and top Shin Bet officials held multiple discussions overnight to assess the viability of a strike before the green light was given, the official said. A key focus of the discussions was assessing Israeli intelligence indicating that there were no hostages in the area, the official added, as well as the effect that carrying out such a significant strike might have on ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal negotiations. US officials said that Israel informed the United States that they had targeted senior Hamas officials in an airstrike Saturday but did not give advance warning of the operation. Little is known about Deif. Thought to have been born in the 1960s, Deif is a bomb maker was behind a wave of suicide attacks in 1996 that killed 65 people in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and other outrages intended to derail the peace process. His full name is Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, but he became known as El Deif (the Guest), because, for decades, he stayed in different houses every night to avoid being tracked, and killed, by Israel. Deif has been the target of Israeli assassination attempts before. A 2014 Israel strike killed his wife, seven-month-old son and three-year-old daughter. In May, the International Criminal Court said it was seeking arrest warrants for Deif and other senior Hamas figures, saying they had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe they bore responsibility for the October 7 attacks, which saw around 1,200 Israelis killed. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza - aimed at destroying Hamas and rescuing hostages still being held - has since killed more than 38,000 people. Pressure on ceasefire deal The strike comes at a delicate time in negotiations for a possible ceasefire and hostage release deal. While killing Deif would be seen as a major victory for Israel, it could encourage Hamas to harden its position on a three-phase Israeli proposal that was laid out by US President Joe Biden at the end of May. Talks to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages are ongoing. A Hamas political official denied reports on Sunday that Hamas is halting ceasefire negotiations due to Saturday\u2019s strike. Izzat Al-Rishq also called the strike an \u201cescalation\u201d and claimed one of the Israeli government\u2019s goals \u201cis to block the path to reaching an agreement that stops the aggression against our people.\u201d Meanwhile, at his press conference Saturday, Netanyahu insisted he would not move \u201cone millimeter\u201d from the framework laid out by Biden. He claimed Hamas had requested 29 changes to the proposal, but he refused to make even one. \u201cI\u2019m not adding conditions or removing conditions,\u201d he said. Hamas has not yet publicly commented on Netanyahu\u2019s claims. However, a diplomatic source involved in the negotiations said the ceasefire talks were still scheduled to take place in Doha, Qatar, next week despite the strike. In Israel on Saturday, protesters and families of hostages took to the streets of several cities to demand the government secure a deal to release all the hostages. In Jerusalem, masses outside the Knesset demanded the government accept the hostage release deal and bring everyone home now. Some protesters also gathered outside Netanyahu\u2019s office. In Tel Aviv, Andrey Kozlov, who was held hostage in Gaza for eight months before the Israeli military rescued him in June, addressed the crowd. \u201cI want to share that every day in Gaza was a living hell; every day felt like it could be my last on earth. Take it from me, every day matters, every minute, even every second,\u201d Kozlov said from the Hostage Square in Tel Aviv. \u201cI may look okay to you from the outside, but the pain weighs on me more than anyone can see, more than anyone can imagine,\u201d he added. \u201cI was one of the lucky ones since I wasn\u2019t held in a tunnel. So, I endured harsh conditions and abuse (but) what about the remaining 120 hostages?\u201d Kozlov said. Kozlov also urged Netanyahu to bring the rest of the hostages back home saying, \u201cPlease sign a deal!\u201d The Hostage and Missing Families Forum reminded Netanyahu there would be \u201cno victory\u201d before all the 120 hostages were brought home. The \u201cdeal is in the final stages before signing and returning the hostages home; it is time to instruct the negotiation teams to reach agreements and bring everyone home,\u201d\u00a0it said in a statement. \u201cWe have been waiting for them for 281 days.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_13_asia_malayan-tiger-deaths-malaysia-extinction-intl-hnk", "text": "A recent spate of alarming deaths has heightened fears for the Malayan tiger, wildlife authorities and conservationists say, with some calling the threat to Malaysia\u2019s emblematic animal a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d Native to the jungles of peninsular Malaysia, the majestic feline subspecies is critically endangered, with fewer than 150 believed to be left in the wild due to habitat loss, illegal poaching and a decline in prey. Found on Malaysia\u2019s coat of arms and considered a national heritage symbol, its numbers have plummeted since the 1950s, when around 3,000 roamed the Southeast Asian country, officials say. Against that already grim backdrop, photos and videos of a dead Malayan tiger went viral on social media in late June. The carcass, found bloated and floating in a stream in the rural northern state of Kelantan, was discovered by forest rangers. There was no sign of injury from snares or gunshots, and state forestry officials are conducting a post-mortem examination. The images provoked strong reactions from many in Malaysia, who noted the urgency of saving their national symbol from extinction. \u201cThe plight of Malayan tigers is a national crisis that requires the full attention and commitment of all Malaysians,\u201d Henry Chan, director of conservation at the World Wildlife Fund Malaysia (WWF), told CNN. Stronger conservation efforts are needed, he added, such as enhancing patrols in critical tiger habitats and leveraging advanced technology such as camera traps and drones for monitoring and surveillance. \u201cThese magnificent creatures continue to teeter on the brink of extinction,\u201d Chan said. \u201cLosing just one tiger brings the entire species closer to extinction, making every individual tiger\u2019s life extremely critical to the survival of the species.\u201d \u201cThe Malayan tiger is on the brink of extinction with fewer than 150 remaining in the wild,\u201d said Mark Rayan Darmaraj, country director of Wildlife Conservation Society Malaysia, who noted that suspected poachers were arrested in a separate case in the nearby state of Pahang the following day, \u201cin possession of the skull and bones of a tiger.\u201d \u201cThey suffer from habitat loss, prey depletion and retaliatory killings stemming from human-tiger conflicts,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, the construction of roads through their habitats increases the risk of fatal vehicle collisions as seen in several recent incidents.\u201d On July 6, authorities in the western state of Perak were alerted to a dead tiger found in a storm drain off a major highway. Estimated to have been around 4 years old, the adult male had been hit by a car, officials said. A month earlier, the body of another adult tiger was found by an expressway in Pahang state. Officials believe the tiger, believed to have been 5 years old, was run over by a vehicle while trying to cross the road from a nearby forest reserve. It was the fourth Malayan tiger killed by a vehicle collision between November 2023 and May 2024, according to authorities. Eight-year plan The Malayan tiger was recognized as a subspecies in 2004. Like all tigers, they are excellent swimmers and powerful apex predators. Smaller than Indonesia\u2019s Sumatran tigers and the Bengal tigers found across South Asia, Malayan tigers can grow to about 2.5 meters (about 8 feet) long and weigh up to 130 kilograms (about 280 pounds), experts say, and need large swaths of forest to roam. Their slightly darker, reddish-orange coats also distinguish them from other tiger species. In an eight-year National Tiger Conservation Action Plan released in collaboration with non-profit groups in 2020, Malaysian officials outlined priorities such as conservation tools and a \u201cNational Physical Plan\u201d to aid conservation efforts. \u201cBy implementing a suite of concerted actions, backed by political commitment and public support, we as a nation and as part of the global conservation community can ensure that one of the most majestic and charismatic animals with which we share the planet will not vanish,\u201d the report said.

Sue Mi Terry, who was once a member of the US National Security Council, first acted as a foreign agent in June 2013 as she began meeting with an unnamed \u201chandler\u201d on \u201cmultiple occasions,\u201d according to the indictment, which was unsealed Tuesday. \u201cAt the direction of ROK (Republic of Korea) government officials, Terry advocated ROK policy positions, including in published articles and during\u00a0media appearances, disclosed nonpublic US government information to ROK intelligence officers, and facilitated access for ROK government officials to US government officials,\u201d the indictment alleges. In return, South Korean officials\u00a0allegedly\u00a0offered the former analyst around $37,000, claiming they could conceal the origin of the funds by depositing them into a designated \u201cgift\u201d account at the think tank where she worked, according to the indictment. Terry also\u00a0allegedly\u00a0received lavish goods \u2013 including a $3,450 Louis Vuitton handbag, a $2,845 Dolce & Gabbana coat and dinners at Michelin star restaurants \u2013 and she was paid to write opinion articles that advocated South Korean policy positions in American and Korean media outlets, the filing claims. Iva Zori\u0107, a spokesperson for the Council on Foreign Relations think tank that employed Terry, said the senior fellow was placed on administrative leave immediately after it learned of the indictment. \u201cWe take these allegations very seriously,\u201d Zori\u0107 told CNN. The indictment alleges Terry acted as a \u201cvaluable source\u201d of information for the South Korean government. In one instance, Terry had participated in an off-the-record North Korea policy briefing with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in June 2022. As soon as the meeting ended, she passed her handler \u201cdetailed handwritten notes\u201d that described the contents of the closed-door briefing, the indictment alleges. In a statement, a spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service said, \u201cthe intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States are in close communication regarding the indictment related to the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\u201d Separately, a spokesperson for Seoul\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, \u201cit is not appropriate to comment on a matter pending in foreign judicial proceedings.\u201d US law obligates American citizens to register as foreign agents if they engage in\u00a0certain behaviors\u00a0for or on behalf of a foreign government.\u00a0The indictment alleges that Terry\u00a0was acting as a foreign agent\u00a0but\u00a0did not register as required, which is a crime. In a statement, Lee Wolosky, Terry\u2019s attorney, said the allegations against his client are \u201cunfounded,\u201d adding that Terry was a \u201charsh critic\u201d of the South Korean government during the period she was allegedly acting on its behalf. \u201cOnce the facts are made clear it will be evident the (US) government made a significant mistake,\u201d Wolosky said. Terry, born in Seoul and a naturalized US citizen, began working for the US government in 2001. She served as a high-profile analyst on East Asian issues for the CIA before pre-emptively resigning\u00a0in 2008 due to a conflict of interest regarding her relationship with South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, as recorded in an FBI interview in June 2023. She later\u00a0served\u00a0as the director for Japan, Korea, and Oceanic affairs for the National Security Council under both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. In June 2013, five years after leaving the CIA, Terry began operating as a foreign diplomat under the UN reporting to some of the highest-ranking officials serving South Korea, further deepening ties with them. No stranger to the media, Terry has been featured in multiple outlets, including appearances on CNN. She has authored reports for both American and South Korean news outlets. Terry had previously told Congress under oath that she had not acted as a foreign agent while testifying before a House hearing\u00a0regarding North Korea\u2019s escalation of nuclear activity. South Korea is a key US ally in the Asia-Pacific, though Terry\u2019s indictment is not the first case of alleged collusion to test the two countries\u2019 friendship. Internal Pentagon documents\u00a0leaked last year\u00a0described, in remarkable detail, private conversations between two senior South Korean national security officials, whom the US had\u00a0allegedly wiretapped.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/asia/sue-mi-terry-us-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra and former British prime ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were just some of the famous faces who flew in to Mumbai to attend the star-studded event. The wedding also attracted many of the biggest names in Indian entertainment, sport, business and politics, from Bollywood stars like Rajinikanth and Sanjay Dutt, to former president Ram Nath Kovind, the chief ministers of various states and numerous members of the country\u2019s revered cricket team. No expense was spared by the Ambanis, the family behind India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. In a rain-soaked Mumbai, police closed roads in the area surrounding the Ambani-owned, 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Center ahead of a red-carpet-style arrival event. Attendees dressed the part, streaming past photographers in custom sarees, lehengas and kurtas at an event that may set forthcoming trends in Indian wedding fashion. International guests also honored the traditional dress code, with many seen wearing designs by major Indian fashion designers. John Cena walked the red carpet in an embroidered sky blue sherwani and white pants, while Jonas sparkled in a\u00a0baby pink version \u2014 made from a boucl\u00e9-style woven fabric embedded with sequins\u00a0\u2014 and matching satin trousers. Jonas arrived with his wife and actor, Priyanka Chopra, who opted for an intricately embellished sunshine yellow lehengai. The fashion crowd were out in full force too. Zendaya\u2019s longtime stylist Law Roach arrived in a mauve velvet jacket, purple tunic and a pair of Schiaparelli gold toed shoes, while designer and New York Fashion Week staple Prabal Gurung wore a rose-colored sherwani and aviator sunglasses. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, who skipped the red carpet entirely, were seen on social media dressed in gold and red saris respectively. Kim\u2019s ensemble featured an off-the-shoulder tasseled bodice, whereas Khlo\u00e9 opted for long, ornate sleeves, stacked necklaces and an opulent maang tikka. In an Instagram story, Kim teased that their film crew was in tow for an episode of their show \u201cThe Kardashians.\u201d Once inside the venue, which was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, celebrities including Chopra and Cena were seen dancing and letting loose. Footage widely shared on social media also showed members of the Ambani family dancing on stage with Indian singer, Daler Mehndi. The night\u2019s other performers included Afrobeats star Rema, who performed his hit song \u201cCalm Down.\u201d As for the couple itself, the groom first arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers, which he later changed for the ceremony. The bride dazzled in hand-embroidered bridal couture by the Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Merchant followed the Gujarati tradition of wearing red and white in an opulent red-trimmed ivory ensemble. It featured a 16-foot-long veil adorned with stones and sequins and a long ghagra, or traditional skirt, with a nearly seven-foot-long detachable train, according to her stylist Rhea Kapoor, who shared a first look on Instagram. Ahead of her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their\u00a0relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family, Merchant changed into an\u00a0opulent red and gold outfit\u00a0featuring a woven blouse, lehenga, veil and embroidered\u00a0head covering. In a video posted to social media on Friday morning, Anant\u2019s mother Nita Ambani recounted a recent trip to Varanasi, in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state, where she sought blessings for the pair. She said she hoped to \u201creimagine and present the purity, positivity and beauty of Varanasi at the wedding,\u201d adding that the event would \u201cpay a tribute to India\u2019s glorious culture and heritage, brought to life by thousands of artisans\u2026 weavers and craftspeople.\u201d It was also revealed that the gown Nita Ambani wore on the event red carpet took more than 40 days to create. The custom peach silk ghagra was designed by couture house Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and artisans Vijay Kumar and Monika Maurya. A lavish affair The Ambani family has remained tight-lipped about proceedings in the build-up to Friday\u2019s wedding, though rumors about the guest list and the identity of star performers have swirled in recent weeks. Local press and Indian social media users have also pored over speculation over everything from the dinner menu to the items of jewelry that might be on display from the family\u2019s sizable collection. One of India\u2019s best-known fashion designers, Manish Malhotra, served as the event\u2019s creative director. The celebrated couturier produced bespoke outfits for various members of the Ambani family throughout the month-long wedding celebrations. \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event \u2026 is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he told CNN via e-mail ahead of the wedding. In the days leading up to Friday\u2019s ceremony, the couple took part in several traditional pre-wedding rituals. Justin Bieber performed at the pair\u2019s \u201csangeet,\u201d a night of music and dance, last Friday. The couple then attended a private \u201chaldi\u201d ceremony, which traditionally sees friends and family bless the bride and groom by applying a turmeric paste to their heads, faces or bodies. As per Hindu tradition, the wedding dates were reportedly chosen according to auspicious days on the bride and groom\u2019s birth charts. A Brown University graduate, 29-year-old Anant Ambani is Mukesh\u2019s youngest child and serves as director at an energy business operated by Reliance. His bride Radhika Merchant, also 29, is the daughter of Viren and Shaila Merchant, the founders of pharmaceutical company Encore Healthcare. It is not known precisely how much money the Ambani family has spent on the pair\u2019s wedding celebrations. Industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars, with musical performers reported to be receiving seven- or even eight-figure sums. On the streets of Mumbai, residents spoken to by Reuters had mixed feelings about the extravagant event \u2014 and the wealth on display. \u201cIt\u2019s their wealth but it is beyond ridiculous what they are doing,\u201d said preschool teacher Devanshi Zaveri, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to show off that much.\u201d Banker Jenica Kothari meanwhile welcomed the boost to local businesses: \u201cIt\u2019s helping the economy, it\u2019s helping everyone\u2026 So, I think if they have the money, they should spend it.\u201d Local hotel rates reportedly soared as the thousands of guests prepared to jet to Mumbai, a financial hub that serves as India\u2019s commercial capital. Months of celebrations Festivities are set to continue through the weekend at the Ambani family\u2019s soaring 27-story Mumbai residence, Antilia. Saturday is expected to see a \u201cShubh Ashirwad,\u201d or divine blessings ceremony, while a Sunday reception (with an \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code) will give guests a final chance to celebrate with the couple. The weekend schedule concludes seven months of build-up to what has been described as India\u2019s wedding of year. Celebrations kicked off with a celebrity-filled engagement party in January. Two months later, the Ambanis hosted a communal dinner for more than 50,000 villagers and a 1,200-guest pre-wedding bash \u2014 attended by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump \u2014 featuring a rare live performance by Rihanna. In May, the family then chartered a cruise ship to take guests on a four-day trip around the Mediterranean. The schedule included multiple stops through Europe and on-deck concerts from the Backstreet Boys and Pitbull, among others. Anant\u2019s older sister, Isha, also held a lavish wedding in 2018. Her marriage to businessman Anand Piramal was watched by celebrities, politicians and business tycoons, while her pre-wedding bash featured an intimate private concert by Beyonc\u00e9.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-mumbai-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The reclusive tribe has been sighted coming out of the rainforest more frequently in recent weeks in search of food, apparently moving away from the growing presence of loggers, said local indigenous rights group FENAMAD. The Mashco Piro were photographed at the end of June on the banks of a river in the Madre de Dios region in southeast Peru near the border with Brazil, Survival International said as it released the photos. \u201cThese incredible images show that a large number of isolated Mashco Piro live alone a few kilometers from where the loggers are about to start their operations,\u201d said Survival International director Caroline Pearce. More than 50 Mashco Piro people appeared in recent days near a village of the Yine people called Monte Salvado. Another group of 17 appeared by the nearby village of Puerto Nuevo, said the NGO, which defends indigenous rights. The Mashco Piro, who inhabit an area located between two natural reserves in Madre de Dios, have seldom appeared as a rule and do not communicate much with the Yine or anyone else, according to Survival International. Several logging companies hold timber concessions inside the territory inhabited by the Mashco Piro. One company, Canales Tahuamanu, has built more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) of roads for its logging trucks to extract timber, according to Survival International. A Canales Tahuamanu representative in Lima did not respond to a request for comment. The company is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, according to which it has 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) of forests in Madre de Dios to extract cedar and mahogany. The Peruvian government reported on June 28 that local residents had reported seeing Mashco Piro on the Las Piedras river, 150 kilometers (93 miles) from the city of Puerto Maldonado, the capital of Madre de Dios. The Mashco Piro have also been sighted across the border in Brazil, said Rosa Padilha, at the Brazilian Catholic bishops\u2019 Indigenous Missionary Council in the state of Acre. \u201cThey flee from loggers on the Peruvian side,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this time of the year they appear on the beaches to take tracaj\u00e1 (Amazon turtle) eggs.

Kyle\u00a0Clifford, 26, was found by officers in Enfield, north London, on Wednesday following an extensive manhunt. He was in serious condition in hospital, then arrested on Thursday, police said. \u201cA man has now been arrested in connection with a triple murder which happened on Tuesday evening,\u201d Hertfordshire Constabulary said Friday. Carol Hunt, 61, the wife of BBC horse racing commentator, John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, were named as the victims of the attack. The three were found seriously injured at a house in the town of Bushey and later died in hospital. A crossbow was recovered as part of the investigation, which police believe was used in a \u201ctargeted incident.\u201d Detective Superintendent Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said Friday: \u201cOur thoughts remain with the victims\u2019 family at this tragic time.\u201d \u201cThe investigation is moving at pace and as a result, we have now arrested a man.

{"id": "2024_07_14_americas_venezuela-migrants-maduro-biden-intl-latam", "text": "A small corner of Venezuela is spreading slowly along 77th\u00a0Street in Bogota, the capital of Colombia. Municipal maps formally refer to that neighborhood as\u00a0Unir II (\u201cunite\u201d), but to many of its inhabitants it is known as Barrio Hugo Chavez, after the late Venezuelan president. Many of the more than seven million Venezuelans who fled their country over the past decade or more now call Bogota home. The city is brimming with informal communities where migrants come together to help each other integrate and combat the ever-present melancholy and homesickness. Maria Alvarez is one such migrant. A 27-year-old single mother from Valencia, Alvarez left Venezuela in 2017 when her son Gabriel was only one. They haven\u2019t returned since. Gabriel knows his grandparents only from the photos on his mother\u2019s phone and the occasional video call. \u201cEveryone left\u2026 I\u2019ve got family in Brazil, the US, here in Colombia, in Ecuador, in Chile too. We are all abroad: uncles, aunts, cousins\u2026 only my mom and my dad, and one of my brothers remain in Venezuela,\u201d Alvarez told CNN. Most of those seven million migrants left Venezuela after 2014, according to the United Nations, amid an economic and political crisis brought about by a crash in the price of oil \u2013 a key export for Venezuela \u2013 combined with chronic corruption and mismanagement at the hands of government officials. Almost two million of them have been granted work permits to work in Colombia, where life is working out well for Alvarez and many others like her. After the Covid pandemic, she helped create a foundation in\u00a0Unir II\u00a0to provide Venezuelans and Colombians with professional classes and psychological counseling. She now makes a living as a manicurist and has met a new partner. Even so, she still feels the draw of Venezuela. \u201cI just dream of going home and building a life there. Colombia has been good, I feel welcome here, but well, I long to go back,\u201d she told CNN, tearfully. An election and a credible opposition But with the authoritarian government of Nicolas Maduro firmly ensconced in power, for many years those dreams of returning have remained just that. Until now. This month, for the first time in a decade, Venezuela will hold an election in which Maduro\u2019s government is being challenged by an opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, who has a credible chance of winning. In October last year, Maduro formally pledged to grant free and fair elections in 2024 at the end of a long and secretive negotiation process with the US State Department. That pledge was at least partially compromised amid a new spat between Washington and Caracas: the leading opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, was barred from running earlier this year, as was her immediate replacement Corina Yoris. The Venezuelan government has accused the White House of not lifting all economic sanctions against government officials, and in recent weeks opposition supporters and members of Machado\u2019s team have been detained. Even so, many experts believe that come the July 28 election the opposition has a real chance of pushing Maduro out of power. Recent polls put Gonzalez more than twenty percentage points ahead of Maduro and, for the first time in years, electoral observers from the Carter Center and the UN have been invited to monitor the election. Such a lead would make Gonzalez the heavy favorite if this were almost any other democratic country. Yet in Venezuela, the government has a habit of clinging to power. Critics have long accused it of rigging votes and silencing the opposition. Opposition protests were repeatedly repressed in 2014, 2017 and 2019, and hundreds of opposition leaders have been arrested, or exiled. Still, to many, this year feels different. \u201cI personally find it difficult to believe Maduro will just give up power,\u201d said Laura Dib, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America. \u201cHowever, you know, if there\u2019s massive participation with international observation and, of course, with pressure from inside the government itself and international pressure\u2026 that could create some avenues,\u201d she told CNN. Alvarez and many other migrants in Bogota, think similarly: \u201cMaduro can only win the election if he steals it. But if there\u2019s a new government, I\u2019d go back the same day. Not just me, hundreds, thousands\u2026 there won\u2019t be enough planes for everyone to return home,\u201d said Endel Gonzalez, a 54-year-old from Maracaibo who has worked as a food courier in Bogota for the past five years. What it means for America It\u2019s the fate of migrants like Alvarez and millions of others like her that are making this such a closely watched election. Before the pandemic, it was common for Venezuelan migrants to seek opportunities in neighboring countries, but in the past three years more than half a million have headed to the United States\u2019 southern border, moving directly via land from Colombia to Panama and Central America, all the way to Northern Mexico. Venezuelans were the second largest group of migrants apprehended by US Customs and Border Patrol in 2023, totaling over 260,000 encounters, a fivefold increase\u00a0from 2020\u00a0when there were less than 50,000,\u00a0putting pressure on the White House to stem the flow. With the Democratic administration facing an uncertain election in November and migration policies squarely on the ballot, this month\u2019s contest in Caracas could hold profound consequences for US President Joe Biden. Most experts who spoke to CNN believe that if Gonzalez wins, many migrants will decide to return to Venezuela \u2013 but if Maduro clings to power, even more will be tempted to head to the US border, both for political reasons and practical ones. In the early years of Venezuela\u2019s migration boom, many Latin American countries offered emergency permits and ad hoc policies for migrants from the country, but now many are erecting barriers to deter the free movement of people. Colombia for example has stopped issuing documents for recently arrived migrants, while the newly elected president of Panama, Jose Raul Mulino, has proposed fencing off the jungles that connect his country to Colombia. Dib estimates that up to two million more migrants could be on the move by next year. What next? The Biden administration has been instrumental in reaching this moment. Maduro\u2019s agreement to a free and fair election came only after the US partially lifted oil sanctions, and only after repatriation flights for undocumented migrants back to Caracas resumed in October. Direct negotiations between Maduro and the State Department seem to have halted, although Maduro announced last week that his chief negotiator, Jorge Rodriguez, held a meeting with US officials to resume talks. Washington is openly supporting Gonzalez, apparently reasoning that a transition to democracy in Venezuela would not only help negotiations around energy policy and migration, but also help turn Caracas from its ideological alliances with the likes of China, Russia and Iran. But with both countries going to the polls this year, it may be what voters decide in November, rather than July, that really makes the difference. \u201cIf the Biden administration remains in power, I believe (bilateral) negotiations will continue,\u201d Dib said. \u201cNow, if there\u2019s a Trump administration, most likely it\u2019s just conducting business\u2026 without much regard on what happens in terms of democracy and human rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/americas/venezuela-migrants-maduro-biden-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The shutdown of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s US operations will start on July 20, ending nearly two decades of the company operating in the country, according to the company\u2019s statement. \u201cThe company has carefully examined and evaluated the impact of the US legal requirements and made this sad and difficult decision as business opportunities in the country are no longer viable,\u201d Kaspersky Lab said. Independent journalist Kim Zetter first\u00a0reported\u00a0the news of the company\u2019s shutdown. The Commerce Department last month\u00a0announced\u00a0the ban of the sale and provision of Kaspersky software in the United States, citing national security concerns. US officials have claimed that the Russian government could use Kaspersky\u2019s popular anti-virus software to surveil Americans through hacking or data collection. Kaspersky has strenuously denied those claims. More than 400 million people and 240,000 companies worldwide use Kaspersky Lab\u2019s software products, according to the company. Just how many of those people and companies are in the United States is not clear. US government agencies were already banned from using Kaspersky\u00a0Lab software but the Commerce Department\u2019s move to prevent the sale of the software in the United States was unprecedented. The legal authorities cited by the Commerce Department are relatively new and derived in part from a 2021 executive order that President Joe Biden signed in the name of protecting Americans\u2019 personal data from \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d and a related order signed by then-President Donald Trump in 2019. CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0in April that the Commerce Department was taking action against Kaspersky Lab. Founded in Moscow in 1997, Kaspersky Lab grew into one of the world\u2019s most successful anti-virus software companies alongside American rivals like McAfee and Symantec. Kaspersky Lab\u2019s researchers, recognized as top-tier in the cybersecurity industry, are known for analyzing hacking operations suspected of being carried out by a variety of governments including Russia, the United States and Israel, but also cybercriminal threats that affect everyday users.

Women accounted for nearly 90% of those who said they were assaulted, according to the survey released this month. About two-thirds of those respondents said the offense took place aboard a train, with a similar amount saying it occurred during the morning or evening rush hour. Many of those respondents also said they had been groped on multiple occasions, with one person saying they were assaulted \u201calmost daily\u201d while still in high school. \u201cFor some reason, I cry more now when I remember it than when it happened,\u201d they told the survey. Efforts to tackle chikan picked up at the turn of the century, when major cities like Tokyo began rolling out women-only carriages on trains. In recent years, more surveillance cameras have been installed on trains and in stations and transit police \u2013 both in uniform and plain clothes \u2013 have stepped up patrols. Wider efforts to combat the crime include the sale of \u201canti-groping\u201d stamps to mark assailants with invisible ink, and mobile apps that map groping incidents. Meanwhile, posters at stations aim to raise awareness of groping and urge people to report the crime. But some survey respondents urged authorities to do more. \u201cI would like the government to create a society that prevents crime, to offer mental health care for victims by professionals, and to carry out public relations activities to raise public awareness so that victims are not taken lightly,\u201d one respondent wrote. Japan arrested nearly 2,000 people nationwide on suspicion of chikan\u00a0in 2023, according to police statistics. But many offenses go unreported: 80% of survey respondents who said they were groped did not report the crimes to police or other officials \u2013 with many saying they did not register the gravity of what happened to them or did not think it was worth alerting the authorities. \u201cWe need to continue to educate people that molestation is a serious crime,\u201d a Japanese government spokesperson told CNN, adding that public groping should always be reported. \u201cPlease do not worry alone, but consult with us,\u201d the spokesperson said. Jeffrey Hall, a Japanese studies lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba, said the survey results appear \u201csurprisingly low.\u201d \u201cYou talk to any Japanese women and they will tell you it\u2019s very common,\u201d he said. Many chikan survivors fear reporting the crime could create trouble for co-workers or school staff, he added. They may also be discouraged by the perception of a lengthy police process for a crime that is hard to prove and for which perpetrators often get away with light punishment, Hall said. \u201cOverall there is a sense of resignation and disappointment that authorities haven\u2019t been able to stop that from happening,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_gambia-upholds-fgm-ban-intl", "text": "Gambia\u2019s parliament has voted to uphold a landmark law that bans female genital mutilation (FGM) in the largely Muslim nation, after religious groups pushed for the legislation to be repealed. If Monday\u2019s bid had been successful, the tiny West African country would have been the first in the world to relegalize FGM after criminalizing it. MP Amadou Camara, who chairs a joint health and gender committee that recommended that FGM should remain outlawed, told CNN that none of the clauses seeking the repeal of the ban in the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed. Parliament Speaker Fabakary Jatta\u00a0ruled that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the bill, which passed a second reading four months ago, to be read a third time and to pass without those clauses. \u201cI so rule that the bill is rejected, and the legislative process exhausted,\u201d Jatta said at plenary meeting Monday. FGM was prohibited in Gambia in 2015 by former president Yahya Jammeh who authorized the\u00a0imposition of fines and prison sentences\u00a0of up to three years for individuals who engaged in it. The law also punished perpetrators with life sentences in cases where the practice led to death. Pro-Islamic groups and lawmakers pushed back against the criminalization, saying that female circumcision was \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d Other prominent Gambians, such as opposition leader and former interior minister Mai Ahmad Fatty also defended the practice, arguing that: \u201cThere is no FGM in Gambia. We circumcise, not mutilate.\u201d Human rights organization Amnesty International earlier described efforts to revoke the FGM ban as a \u201cbackward move\u201d for the protection of human rights in the country. In Gambia, 73% of women aged between 15 and 49 years had experienced FGM as of 2020, according to the United Nations. More than 65% of those women were subjected to the practice \u201cbefore the age of five years,\u201d the UN said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Women\u2019s Day in March that he was \u201coutraged\u201d by moves by Gambia\u2019s parliament to legalize FGM, describing the practice as \u201chorrific.\u201d Despite the ban, FGM has still been performed on children in parts of the country. Last year, three women were convicted of performing the practice on eight female minors\u00a0and ordered to pay fines of around 15,000 Gambian Dalasi ($220) each or face a one-year jail sentence. The penalties were\u00a0reported\u00a0to have been paid by an Islamic cleric. In 2016, two women also faced charges\u00a0after a 5-month-old girl died from genital mutilation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/gambia-upholds-fgm-ban-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The two men standing against him \u2013 Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana \u2013 said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame\u2019s overwhelming victory was all but certain. Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end\u00a0the 1994 genocide in\u00a0Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy. Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening. Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed. Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stability candidate. His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of\u00a0supporting rebels\u00a0in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 a charge he has also denied. Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling center in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent. \u201cWe voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,\u201d Pheneas said. \u201cI voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.\u201d Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen. \u201cI voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,\u201d Vedaste said. The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame\u2019s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents. Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress. \u201cWe toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,\u201d Habineza said after voting. \u201cWe have to maintain this momentum and not regress,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are confident, each of us is confident, it\u2019s half and half,\u201d independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote. The US State Department says on its website\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0has made \u201cprogress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation.\u201d It also says it backs\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0efforts to \u201cincrease democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/rwanda-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_17_asia_cyanide-thai-hotel-deaths-intl-hnk", "text": "Six people, including two US citizens,\u00a0who were found dead inside a luxury hotel room in central Bangkok likely drank from tea and coffee cups laced with cyanide following a dispute linked to\u00a0bad investments, Thai police said Wednesday. The grisly discovery was made on Tuesday when staff at the five-star Grand Hyatt Erawan in the Thai capital entered the fifth-floor suite after the guests missed check out by more than 24 hours. When police arrived at the scene, they found the bodies of three men and three women, a table full of untouched food wrapped in plastic and used cups with traces of a white powder. The door was locked from the inside, police said, though a backdoor was left unlocked. Authorities initially said they were searching for a seventh person who was part of the hotel booking. But on Wednesday they dismissed this line of inquiry, saying\u00a0they believe one of the deceased poisoned the others with the deadly fast-acting chemical cyanide. Among the dead\u00a0are two Vietnamese Americans and four Vietnamese nationals including a married couple aged between 37 and 56,\u00a0Thai police said. Chief of the Police Forensic Office Trairong Phiewphan said in a press conference that cyanide was found in mugs and cups in the hotel room and at least one of the blood samples collected from a deceased man had traces of the chemical. \u201cCyanide was found in the liquid inside the teapot, in all six coffee cups,\u201d Trairong said. Images issued by the Royal Thai Police showed cups on a coffee table next to two metal thermos flasks and a dining table laden with plates of food, prepared as if people were about to sit down to eat. The question police are now trying to answer is whether the victims were murdered or chose to take their lives. Wednesday\u2019s press conference suggested police were leaning toward the former. Deputy Metropolitan Police Commissioner Noppasin Poonsawat told reporters they believe one of the members of the group may have poisoned the five others. That person, police said, had ordered the food and tea to the room and \u201clooked under stress\u201d when staff arrived. Noppasin said from interviews with hotel staff, one of the members of the group was alone in the room when the food arrived and was later joined by the other guests. He added that the incident was likely linked to a \u201cpersonal matter\u201d and not related to organized crime as interviews carried out with relatives of the dead indicated a dispute over debt. \u201cOne of the relatives said one of the deceased was an investment agent and all (the deceased) invested, but the business was not going as expected. They made an appointment to discuss the matter in Thailand,\u201d Noppasin said. Two of the deceased were found in the bedroom, another at the dining table, and police believe one member of the party tried to reach the door but fell before they were able to do so. Police said the group had arrived in Thailand on various dates and had booked separate rooms at the hotel. On July 15, the party all moved into the same room and had room service delivered at about 2 p.m. local time. No one left or entered the suite after 2:17 p.m., according to police. The Grand Hyatt hotel, where the deaths occurred, is located in a bustling tourist area in the heart of Bangkok that\u2019s home to luxury shopping malls and restaurants. Next to the hotel is the Erawan shrine, a famous landmark popular with Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh communities and tourists. The shrine, a preferred spot for those seeking good luck, was also the target of a bombing in 2015 that killed at least 20 people. The US State Department said it was \u201caware of reports of the deaths of two US citizens in Bangkok\u201d and Reuters reported that Vietnam\u2019s government said its embassy in the Thai capital was closely coordinating with Thai authorities. \u201cWe offer our sincere condolences to the families on their loss. We are closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to provide consular assistance to those families,\u201d US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a briefing Tuesday.

In a 236-page report titled \u201c\u2018I Can\u2019t Erase All the Blood from My Mind\u2019: Palestinian Armed Groups\u2019 October 7 Assault on Israel,\u201d the rights watchdog said that the October 7 attack was \u201cdirected against a civilian population,\u201d and that \u201ckilling civilians and taking hostages were central aims of the planned attack, not an afterthought, a plan gone awry, or isolated acts.\u201d \u201cThe Hamas-led assault on October 7 was designed to kill civilians and take as many people as possible hostage,\u201d said Ida Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at HRW. The assault was led by Hamas\u2019 military wing \u2013 the Qassam Brigades \u2013 but included at least four other Palestinian armed groups, the report said. The report details several dozen cases of serious violations of international humanitarian law by Palestinian armed groups at most civilian attack sites on October 7, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The rights group said it interviewed 144 people, including 94 Israeli and other nationals, who witnessed the October 7 assault, which targeted at least 19 kibbutzim (agricultural communes) and five moshavim (cooperative communities). The cities of Sderot and Ofakim, two music festivals, and a beach party were also targeted, HRW added. \u201cThe armed groups committed numerous violations of the laws of war that amount to war crimes,\u201d the report said. These include \u201cattacks targeting civilians and civilian objects, willful killing of people in custody, cruel and other inhumane treatment.\u201d Palestinian fighters committed summary killings and hostage-taking along with murder and wrongful imprisonment, HRW added. Sexual and gender-based violence The report also highlighted \u201ccrimes involving sexual and gender-based violence, hostage-taking, mutilation and despoiling bodies, use of human shields, and pillage and looting.\u201d Israel and the United Nations have also accused Hamas-led militants of committing sexual violence on October 7. In March, the UN special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, said her team found \u201creasonable grounds to believe that conflict related sexual violence, including rape and gang rape occurred\u201d that day. It was the UN\u2019s most definitive finding on allegations of sexual assault in the aftermath of the attack. Several first responders who attended the scenes of the October 7 attack told CNN in December that the attacks were overwhelmingly gruesome and that some female victims were found undressed. HRW said that Hamas responded to its questions, stating that its forces were instructed not to target civilians and to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law. \u201cIn many cases, Human Rights Watch investigations found evidence to the contrary,\u201d the watchdog said. Hamas rejected the findings of the report and called for it to be retracted, according to a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe reject the lies and blatant bias towards the occupation and the lack of professionalism and credibility in the Human Rights Watch report. We demand its withdrawal and an apology,\u201d the Palestinian group said. \u2018Atrocities do not justify atrocities\u2019 In response to the October 7 attack, Israel launched an air and ground offensive on Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of Gaza\u2019s population of 2 million, turned swathes of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. Previous HRW reports have addressed several alleged serious violations by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 7. In its Wednesday report, HRW called on all parties involved in the conflict to abide by international humanitarian law. \u201cThe Palestinian armed groups in Gaza should immediately and unconditionally release civilians held hostage,\u201d the report said, adding that both parties \u201cshould surrender for prosecution anyone facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant.\u201d In May, the ICC said it was seeking arrest warrants for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, among other Israeli and Hamas officials, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza. \u00a0A case is also being heard by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over an accusation by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide in its war in Gaza. \u201cAtrocities do not justify atrocities,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cTo stop the endless cycle of abuses in Israel and Palestine, it\u2019s critical to address root causes and hold violators of grave crimes to account. That\u2019s in the interests of both Palestinians and Israelis.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/middleeast/hamas-israel-october-7-attack-human-rights-watch-report-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_13_americas_avocado-cartel-us-mexico-intl-latam", "text": "When two US avocado inspectors were assaulted and detained at a police roadblock in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n last month, it sparked a costly international crisis. The US paused all avocado imports from the state for more than a week, leaving Mexican growers out of tens of millions of dollars and temporarily sending the price of a carton of the fruit in the US soaring by 40 percent, according to analysis firm RaboResearch Food & Agribusiness. Weeks later, after diplomats and agricultural officials from both countries negotiated new security guidelines around inspections, the massive cross-border trade has stabilized, with the US Department of Agriculture saying that export levels returned to normal at the beginning of July. But the episode underscored the precarious nature of the industry and the immense volatility in a region that provides most of the world\u2019s avocados, one of Mexico\u2019s most dangerous states and a nexus of cartel power. US and Mexican officials are now considering new changes to the strict processes that direct how the fruit can make its way to American kitchens to meet ever-increasing demand, with industry groups and advocates urging for more oversight. \u2018Green gold\u2019 Avocados, the creamy fruit with the industry nickname \u201cgreen gold,\u201d are big business. Of the amount exported from the nearly 2.7 million metric tons of the fruit grown last year in Mexico, 81 percent went to the US, at a value of $2.7 billion. Nearly three-quarters of Mexican avocados come from Michoac\u00e1n, a state along the country\u2019s Pacific coast with a volcanic belt running through it that makes its soil ideal for farming. The state\u2019s deepwater port has also been critical for the flourishing of drug cartels, which moved into Michoac\u00e1n in the 1980s, fueling a homicide rate that is today more than twice the national average. The expansion of the avocado market in the state around the same time has been \u201cdeeply intertwined\u201d with the violent groups and corrupt public authorities, researchers at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime said in a report this year. Citing interviews with growers in the state, the researchers described how criminal groups illegally burn and log protected forests and bribe local officials to change permissions around the use of the land to allow for commercial activity. According to an academic article published by the Mexican government cited in the report, 80 percent of the avocado orchards in Michoac\u00e1n were established illegally, \u201cinitially through unauthorized land use that was then turned into legal parcels thanks to corruption of public authorities.\u201d Cartels today also regularly extort producers in protection schemes, the report found. Local police forces in turn commonly rent themselves out as security for producers, and heavily armed militias known as \u201cautodefensa\u201d groups have formed to patrol farms. \u201cThis is the core of the mafia-style relationships that exist in Michoac\u00e1n around avocado production,\u201d Romain Le Cour, one of the report authors and a senior expert at the initiative, said in an interview. \u201cYou need criminal actors in a way to stir up the business, you need business entrepreneurs to run the business, and you need corrupt authorities to make sure that what you\u2019re doing becomes legalized or laundered.\u201d Mexican officials in the aftermath of the detention of the inspectors in June were quick to downplay the incident, claiming it was nonviolent and unrelated to organized crime and the inspectors\u2019 work in the avocado industry. The inspectors, who were Mexican citizens working for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, were stopped and taken from their car after attempting to cross a barricade on a highway set up by police officers who were protesting a pay issue, according to Alfredo Ram\u00edrez Bedolla, the Michoac\u00e1n governor. US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar has said, however, that the men were assaulted. The office of the Michoac\u00e1n state prosecutor told CNN last month that they\u2019ve opened an investigation into the incident. A dangerous job Since the US first allowed imports of avocados from Michoac\u00e1n in 1997, APHIS employees in the country have inspected avocado orchards to ensure they are free of pests that could harm US avocado crops. About 100 inspectors from the agency operate within the state, according to Ram\u00edrez, visiting avocado groves and packing facilities to check the fruit before issuing a certification. That close contact and pivotal responsibility leaves them \u201cextremely exposed to corruption and violence,\u201d said Le Cour, the GI-TOC expert. In 2022, exports of Mexican avocados were similarly halted for several days after one of the US inspectors working in Michoac\u00e1n received a threatening phone call. In the wake of both incidents, Mexican leaders have pushed to change the bilateral agreement regulating the trade to allow for the Mexican government to take over the inspections, with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador criticizing the US decision to halt the export as \u201carrogance.\u201d In a news conference last month, Mexican Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos said the Mexican government was \u201cperfectly prepared\u201d to do the work, which he said would be valuable to \u201cavoid having to stop the export.\u201d Officials at the US State Department and USDA have considered the possible change, according to Ken Melban, the vice president for industry affairs and operations at the California Avocado Commission, which represents growers in the state. In a statement, Melban called it \u201cunimaginable the US government would consider abdicating inspection responsibilities to Mexico.\u201d Such a change, he told CNN, would leave him doubtful of the integrity of certifications that the exported avocados are actually pest-free. \u201cUS farmers will not be protected under such a program, one intended and designed specifically to protect US farmers\u2019 economic interests,\u201d he said. An APHIS spokesperson declined to comment on the thinking around the policy. US and Mexican officials have also recently resurfaced discussions around a policy to block the export of avocados from Mexico grown in orchards on illegally cleared lands, according to Brad Adams, the executive director of Climate Rights International, an advocacy group that used satellite imagery last year to document the widespread deforestation behind the market. Leaders in both countries have voiced support for such a policy, but have so far been unable to decide on a legal mechanism to enact it. In a letter this spring to a group of US senators who had pushed for the change, the USDA noted that its inspectors don\u2019t have the regulatory authority to certify around the issue, according to a copy obtained by CNN. Instead, the agency pointed towards training and technical assistance that the US Forest Service has provided to Mexico \u201cto support real-time deforestation monitoring of priority regions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve exposed something that is illegal and therefore indefensible,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey have an obligation that they recognize at a governmental level in Mexico, and the US can\u2019t keep importing illegally harvested produce.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/americas/avocado-cartel-us-mexico-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Poisoning has not been ruled out, Thiti said. Authorities are currently searching for the seventh person who was part of the hotel booking, and is now a possible suspect. The other four deceased are Vietnamese nationals. Thiti said police believe one member of the party tried to reach the door but fell before they were able to do so.

The Eugenic Protection Law, in place from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to forcibly sterilize people with disabilities, including those with mental disorders, hereditary diseases or physical deformities and leprosy. It also allowed forced abortions if either parent had those conditions. At least 25,000 people were sterilized\u00a0under the law, Kishida told a meeting at his official residence of about 130 survivors, many now elderly and in wheelchairs, public broadcaster NHK reported Wednesday. \u201cI decided to meet with you today in order to personally express my remorse and apology for the tremendous physical and mental suffering that many people have endured based on the former Eugenic Protection Law,\u201d Kishida said. The law was unconstitutional and had violated individuals\u2019 human rights and dignity, the prime minister said, adding he had ordered authorities to prepare a new compensation plan for survivors, without sharing the details. Plaintiffs and their supporters have argued that a previous government compensation offer of 3.2 million yen (about $20,000) each was too low.\u00a0They won a significant victory\u00a0earlier this month, when Japan\u2019s Supreme Court ordered the government to pay 16.5 million yen (about $105,000) each in damages to plaintiffs of several lawsuits and 2.2 million yen ($14,000) to their spouses. One plaintiff, Kikuo Kojima, described being taken to the hospital when he was 19, where he said he was \u201cgiven the nickname \u2018Schizophrenic\u2019 and forced into eugenic surgery.\u201d \u201cI will never forget that,\u201d he said, according to NHK. Other plaintiffs said they were bedridden for years following their operations, faced a lifetime of discrimination, were unable to work due to the physical and mental toll, and wished their bodies could return to their \u201coriginal\u201d state, NHK reported. Eugenics law Japan experienced a brief baby boom after World War II, alarming authorities as they struggled to deal with severe nationwide food shortages and a war-ravaged economy, according to academics and Japanese medical associations. The government leapt to implement population control measures, including a national campaign to promote contraception \u2013 and the Eugenic Protection Law, which \u201cmade abortions and sterilizations available,\u201d and was described as \u201cgovernment policy in the population field\u201d in a 1972 report by the government-run Institute of Population Problems. The legislation aimed to \u201cprevent the increase of the inferior descendants from the eugenic point of view and to protect the life and health of the mother,\u201d according to a copy of the law \u2013 which listed \u201cremarkable abnormal sexual desire\u201d and \u201cremarkable clinical inclination\u201d among the conditions targeted. Besides an official apology, the plaintiffs have also demanded a compensation law that would benefit all survivors, even those who haven\u2019t filed lawsuits. They also urged authorities to quickly conclude ongoing related legal cases, stressing that most plaintiffs were\u00a0reaching the end of their lives, NHK reported. \u201cI heard the apology directly from the prime minister to the victims, but I think we could have heard it earlier,\u201d said Koji Niisato, an attorney for plaintiffs, according to NHK. \u201cToday, I hope that you will listen to the actual conditions of the victims and their real voices and do your utmost to achieve a full resolution for them.\u201d Some plaintiffs also said they were not fully satisfied with the government\u2019s apology and the Supreme Court ruling. \u201cIt has been really hard for a long time, and even after hearing the verdict, I cannot put my mind at ease,\u201d one plaintiff said, according to NHK.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/asia/japan-kishida-apology-forced-sterilization-eugenics-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The search for Kyle Clifford, 26, began on Tuesday evening when police were called to a house in Bushey, Hertfordshire, where they found three seriously injured women. Carol Hunt, 61, wife of BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, later died from their wounds, according to statements Wednesday from police and Britain\u2019s public broadcaster. A crossbow is believed to have been used in the \u201ctargeted incident,\u201d police said, adding that other weapons may also have been used. Clifford, who police warned may have been armed with a crossbow, was found in Enfield, North London on Wednesday afternoon, Hertfordshire Police said in a statement. \u201cA man wanted in connection with a triple murder in\u00a0Bushey\u00a0has been traced to a location in North London. Following an extensive search, Kyle Clifford, aged 26, was found in the\u00a0Enfield area by officers this afternoon (Wednesday, July 10),\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt this stage, we believe the suspect was known to the victims.\u201d The suspect is hospitalized in a serious condition and is yet to speak with officers, police said in an update Thursday. Clifford left the British army in 2022 after a short period of service, a source in the British defense ministry told CNN. He joined the forces in 2019 and served in the Household Cavalry, his former military boss told CNN. The killings sent shock waves through Britain, where mass murders are rare but violence against women has been labeled a national threat by the government. A woman is killed by a man every three days in the United Kingdom and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem, said earlier this year. \u201cEntrenched patriarchy at almost every level of society, combined with a rise in misogyny that permeates the physical and online world, is denying thousands of women and girls across the UK the right to live in safety, free from fear and violence,\u201d Alsalem said in February. \u2018Utterly devastating\u2019 The BBC\u00a0described the women\u2019s killings as \u201cutterly devastating\u201d in a statement to staff. The\u00a0broadcaster said it would give Hunt \u201call the support we can\u201d as part of a note sent to\u00a0BBC\u00a0Radio 5 Live staff. \u201cThe news today about John Hunt\u2019s family is utterly devastating,\u201d it said. \u201cOur thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\u201d British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper expressed her condolences following the killings. \u201cThe loss of three women\u2019s lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community,\u201d Cooper wrote on X Wednesday. \u201cI am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support Hertfordshire Police with any information about this case.\u201d A neighbor of the women said she \u201cwould see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\u201d according to PA Media. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad what\u2019s happened, very shocking,\u201d she added. In Britain, it is legal for a person to buy or own a crossbow if they are over 18, though anyone who carries one in public without a reasonable excuse can face imprisonment. In February, the previous government launched an eight-week review of the rules and the possibility of introducing a licensing scheme.

{"id": "2024_07_17_style_rajesh-vora-punjab-architecture-snap", "text": "Looking down a street in Daulatpur, a rural village in Punjab, India with a mishmash of eclectic, colorful architecture, photographer Rajesh Vora felt he had struck lucky. In front of him, was a large facsimile of an Air-India plane on top of a pale green\u00a0building. Facing it from across the street, a replica of an army tank atop a yellow residence pointed its gun, the painted figure of a soldier rising from its hatch. Though the designs could have been plucked from an amusement park, they were actually elaborate rooftop water tanks of private homes. Vora\u2019s images of this phenomenon \u2014 a vernacular tradition of architectural icons that sprung up across the\u00a0across the northwestern state some five decades ago \u2014 became a multiyear project that the Mumbai-based photographer is\u00a0now exhibiting at Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles\u00a0in France this summer.\u00a0He visited 150 villages and photographed hundreds of these designs. The ostentatious d\u00e9cor is \u201ca brilliant idea combining form and function,\u201d Vora said in a phone call with CNN. The first time he noticed the water tanks while on assignment in the region in 2014, he was \u201camused, like anybody would be seeing this kind of sculpture,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut then I realized, as an architecture photographer, what amazed me was the integration of the sculptures on the houses, built by local artisans.\u201d Crowning the tops of these homes, the unusual status symbols are often commissioned by Indian emigrants\u00a0who return home during the year, or by their families who still live in the region. Some are functional water tanks while others sit on top more traditional plumbing designs. Each tell a specific story, he explained. \u201cIf somebody plays sports, they\u2019ll put up a football there, if they are a chef they will put a pressure cooker\u2026 if somebody likes a nice drink, they\u2019ll put a bottle of whiskey,\u201d he explained. Planes, tanks and cars became popular motifs, too. \u201cAll their personal aspirations are embodied in their houses.\u201d Last year, Vora published a book, \u201cEveryday Monuments\u201d that features images from some the villages he visited and brings together texts from architectural, scholarly and curatorial experts to explore the unique tradition. Through their research, they approximate that there are around 30 artisans in the region who work with homeowners and their families via word of mouth to create these lively sculptures. Diasporic icons Vora came across the buildings by chance, as he visited a gurdwara\u00a0\u2014 a Sikh temple \u2014 in the village of Talhan while working on a commissioned photo story about global migration. Known as Hawaijahaj, or \u201cAirplane,\u201d gurdwara, visitors bring offerings of model aircraft in hopes that they will be blessed with swift visa approval to leave India. He heard that many who were successful eventually returned to their villages to add planes to the exteriors of newly built homes, he explained. Over the course of six trips from 2014 to 2019, Vora began to better understand the full scope of the trend. It had begun sometime in the 1970s, as Punjabi diasporic communities flourished in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, among other countries.\u00a0As the popularity of custom-designed water tanks grew, local builders became specialized in their craft. The favored icons tend to shift in popularity over the years \u2014 when the country began manufacturing its popular Maruti van, for example, in the 1980s, it began appearing on homes, too. He also observed how architectural styles from different countries began to mix into the villages as owners brought back ideas from abroad to unique effect. But documenting the water tanks proved difficult when he first began. The remote areas of Punjab weren\u2019t yet mapped by Google, he explained, so he visited villages and hoped for the best. \u201cSome days are lucky \u2014 you might get three or four kinds of water tanks; others, you might not get anything,\u201d Vora said. Daulatpur Village, where multiple designs could be seen in one frame, was a rarity. Vora doesn\u2019t know how the tradition will grow or change as the region continues to see major shifts \u2014 especially as Indians from marginalized backgrounds gain more economic mobility and second- or third- generation immigrants amass wealth overseas. \u201cWill they come back to India? Will they build their own houses? Will they take care of these houses?\u201d We don\u2019t know,\u201d Vora said of younger generations. \u201cThese houses are perishable if you don\u2019t maintain them after 30 or 40 years\u2026 maybe they will disappear.\u201d The photographer hopes to continue to create an archive of Punjab\u2019s distinctive architectural legacy \u2014 and he\u2019ll keep looking out for a home that bears the icon of what he would choose if he were commissioning a design. \u201cIt would have to be a camera,\u201d he said with a laugh.

{"id": "2024_07_14_middleeast_hamas-commander-killed-khan-younis-intl", "text": "Israel has announced that a Hamas commander was killed in Saturday\u2019s strike on southern Gaza, but the fate of the major target, Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, remains uncertain. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Sunday that Rafe Salama, the head of the Khan Younis brigade and Deif\u2019s deputy, was \u201celiminated\u201d in the attack. According to the statement, Salama was \u201cone of the closest associates\u201d of Deif, as well as \u201cone of the masterminds\u201d of Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7. It remains unclear if Deif himself died in Saturday\u2019s strike. The Israeli military is verifying whether he was killed while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday it is uncertain whether he died. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said the strike killed at least 90 Palestinians  and injured 300 others in Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian zone. The UN\u2019s Scott Anderson described what he saw at a nearby hospital in the aftermath of the strikes as \u201cthe most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.\u201d An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the architects behind the\u00a0October 7 attacks. He has led the Palestinian militant group\u2019s armed wing for more than two decades. If his death is confirmed, Deif would be the highest profile Hamas leader killed since the war in Gaza began nine months ago. Israel has been seeking to dismantle Hamas following the October 7 attacks but with fighting ongoing and senior Hamas figures at large, that goal has seemed distant. Strike could help deal, Netanyahu claims Netanyahu told the Israeli Channel 14 network on Monday that it was still unclear whether the strike had killed Deif, but added that there were \u201cinteresting indications, I don\u2019t want to say something certainly before we receive more information.\u201d Asked whether the strike could put at risk a potential hostage release and ceasefire deal, Netanyahu insisted it would actually promote a deal. \u201cHamas is weak. The more you hit it, the more you push for a deal,\u201d he told the network. Netanyahu said that for months Hamas \u201cthought they were safe, [now] they see they\u2019re unsafe. The IDF forcefully entered the Philadelphi corridor [along the Egyptian border], conquered the Rafah crossing.\u201d \u201cThis pressure, along with the fierce diplomatic standing of the political echelon and myself over the things we demand, gradually makes them change, surrender, or at least become more flexible. Now we need to increase the pressure. The more pressure we apply, we will get a deal that releases the maximum number of living hostages during the first phase, and gets us closer to our goal of destroying Hamas.\u201d Netanyahu also said the IDF would remain along the Philadelphi corridor, which has been a contentious issue in the negotiations. \u201cThis has consequences, both diplomatic and security related advantages,\u201d he said. Israeli intelligence services said this past week they killed a total of 25 Hamas operatives involved in the October 7 attacks. Ronen Bar, the head of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, announced the figure during a meeting with commanders from the IDF\u2019s Southern Command and 162 Division held in Rafah on Saturday. Bar commended the results of the Shin Bet\u2019s \u201cintensified activity\u201d within Gaza. Meanwhile, a fresh Israeli airstrike that hit a UN agency school in a camp for displaced people in central Gaza on Sunday has killed at least 22 and injured more than 100 others, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza and officials at a nearby hospital.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

The women were Israel Defense Forces (IDF) observers stationed at an Israeli military base at Nahal Oz, which was stormed by Hamas militant groups during their attack on Israel last year. The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said the families of the observers \u2013 Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev \u2013 have decided to allow the publication of photos taken during their first days being held by the militant group. \u201cThe images reveal them bruised and wounded from the horrific abduction that the entire world witnessed,\u201d the forum said. In the pictures, Levy appears to have a badly bruised right eye. Another image shows four of the women sitting on bedding in a bare room; two of them, Gilboa and Ariev, have bandaged heads. \u201cThe courageous decision by the parents to reveal these photos aims to bring them closer to embracing their daughters,\u201d they said. Graphic video showing the capture of the group was previously released in May by their families. Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave. Following the attack,\u00a0Israel\u00a0launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. \u201cThis reunion is just a deal away, a deal that would bring all 120 hostages home \u2013 the living for rehabilitation and the murdered and fallen for proper burial,\u201d the forum said in its Tuesday statement. \u201cWe demand that the Israeli government, and particularly its leader, look these girls in the eyes, try to imagine what they and all the hostages have endured for 284 days, and do everything possible to bring them home.\u201d Albert Ariev, the father of Karina Ariev, told a news conference that accompanied the release: \u201cMy little Karina, only 19 years old, is in Gaza. Today, you see footage of Karina and her friends in their first days of captivity. It\u2019s so vivid \u2013 Karina sitting on a mattress on the floor, with an exhausted and desperate look.\u201d \u201cSwelling in her hands indicates that Karina was bound for a long time. You see one frame, but in the video, you can see facial wounds likely caused by shrapnel when the terrorists invaded the shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we are asking for is to have Karina back. There are also dead people there that need to be buried. The people demand that they all come back.\u201d Ariev urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \u201cPlease don\u2019t go abroad before this deal goes ahead.\u201d Netanyahu is under intense pressure to secure the release of more than 100 hostages still believed to be held by Hamas. Earlier Tuesday, he met with the families of other observers who were killed at the base, close to the northern Gaza Strip, which was overrun in Hamas\u2019 attack last October, with 16 soldiers killed.

The head of the emergency room of Al-Ahli Hospital, Dr. Amjad Elewa, told CNN that 20 men were killed in the strike on the field mosque in Al Shati camp, and two more men died on Sunday in the hospital from their injuries. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces for comment. The spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense Mahmoud Basal told CNN that the bombing happened \u201cin the middle of the noon prayer.\u201d He added that all the injuries are serious cases and required amputation operations. Video of the scene shows bodies lying on what appear to be mats laid out for prayer. Multiple dead and wounded people can be seen missing limbs.

{"id": "2024_07_01_sport_ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "Kateryna Tabashnyk couldn\u2019t hold back her tears \u2013 not necessarily because her attempt to qualify for her first Olympics had fallen short, but because she was now reflecting on all the grief and pain of the past two-and-a-half years. The 30-year-old high jumper cleared 1.89 meters at the Ukrainian Athletics Championships on Sunday, not enough to qualify for this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Paris. But the fact that she had even come so close was a testament to her remarkable willpower and perseverance. Tabashnyk\u2019s mother was killed in a Russian airstrike on Kharkiv two years ago. She had stayed in the eastern city to help her young nephew, who was seriously injured in an earlier attack by Russian forces. Tabashnyk decided to return to competition a month later, viewing sport as a means to honor her mother\u2019s life even in the depths of grief. \u201cOf course, it affects people and, of course, me \u2013 the loss of my home, the loss of my dear mother, the loss of friends,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAll this takes strength, takes energy. It\u2019s like a poison for the body.\u201d \u201cWe have to prepare to compete and show results against this background. Of course, it\u2019s very hard, it\u2019s very difficult, but to be honest, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been getting this energy, this strength for the last two years. It\u2019s something incredible, even for me.\u201d Ukraine will send a team of more than 100 athletes to Paris, and \u2013 though that\u2019s fewer than the country had in Tokyo three years ago \u2013 their participation will likely feel more significant. The Ukrainian athletes competing at the games have endured a myriad of challenges since Russia\u2019s invasion, including facilities being destroyed, friends and relatives being killed and uncertainty about what the future might hold. According to Ukraine\u2019s Sports Ministry, about 3,000 athletes \u2013 from Olympic and non-Olympic sports \u2013 have served for the country\u2019s military, either voluntarily or by being drafted, and 479 have been killed while serving or in civilian life. More than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed, including 15 Olympic training bases. Tabashnyk won bronze at the European Indoor Championships earlier this year \u2013 her first medal at a major event \u2013 and was hoping to be part of Ukraine\u2019s first Olympic team since Russia launched its full-scale invasion with the support of Belarus in February 2022. She had been confident of making the team before a recent injury hampered her preparation for the national championships in Lviv. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how many times I wanted to give it all up, give up on sports, on jumping,\u201d Tabashnyk said. \u201cBut every time I pull myself together and say, \u2018No, now I have to fight like never before.\u2019 And so it goes every time, no matter what obstacle stands in my way.\u201d She is far from the only Ukrainian athlete whose life has been scarred by Russia\u2019s invasion of their country. Many athletes have moved abroad in order to continue their careers and train for this year\u2019s Games. That includes 400-meter hurdler Viktoriia Tkachuk, who has become accustomed to undertaking the 46-hour trip from Ukraine to her training camp in South Africa. Tkachuk\u2019s brother was called up to the frontline in May last year, and since then, her whole family has been fraught with fear about his safety. \u201cWe were all stressed out because we were thinking, \u2018Oh, no, he\u2019s not ready yet, he cannot go there,\u2019\u201d the 29-year-old told CNN. \u201cBut we were doing our best to support him, because if he\u2019s worrying, then he will feel our worries and it will not help him.\u201d Tkachuk saw her brother in February when he had a break from military service, and the pair are in regular contact while they go about their separate lives. \u201cHe\u2019s texted me a message: \u2018You will win there, and I will win here,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSomething like this. \u2026 He has in his pocket \u2013 close to his heart \u2013 small pictures with us together, our family, and he said this picture is always with him. It\u2019s nice to know this.\u201d Having already qualified for the Olympics, a minor injury prevented Tkachuk from competing in Lviv, where CNN spoke to several athletes looking to secure a spot on the team. Despite Russia\u2019s invasion casting a long shadow over Ukraine\u2019s participation at these Olympics, there was a vibrant atmosphere at the event, and most athletes were excited by the chance to compete for an Olympic berth. \u201cNow, with a big team under our flag, we take part in a big Olympic movement, we take part in the biggest contest, and the entire world is looking at us,\u201d Matviy Bidnyi, Ukraine\u2019s acting sports minister, told CNN. \u201cAll of the world awaits what we will do in the Olympic Games, what we can show in the Olympic Games \u2013 that our country, which is in a condition of war now, is in a good shape.\u201d \u201cThis is a very important mission,\u201d he added, \u201cand all our athletes understand their responsibility in it.\u201d Whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to compete at this year\u2019s Olympics, which begin on July 26, has been the topic of intense debate, especially for Ukrainian athletes and officials. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said that Russian and Belarusians can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Paris, provided that they meet certain eligibility requirements. This means that teams of Russian and Belarusian athletes will not be considered, while athletes who actively support the war against Ukraine will also be ineligible. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation, such as flags, anthems or national colors. The IOC ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, but many people in Ukraine were hoping for a more stringent stance. \u201cWe think that this position is strong enough,\u201d said Bidnyi, \u201cbut we think it would be better if they were banned totally.\u201d There will be no Russians or Belarusians taking part in track and field events in Paris as governing body World Athletics has banned athletes from these two countries from competing at an elite level \u2013 the only Olympic sports federation to have done so. This means that athletes like Tkachuk will avoid the potentially challenging situation of lining up against competitors whose nations are at war with her country, irrespective of how they are presented at the Games. \u201cThis is really nice to know, for my brother also, that I\u2019m not going to competitions to run with Russians, or to speak with Russians, or to deal with something that I don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. Her teammate, fellow 400m hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends, we\u2019re not competitors,\u201d Ryzhykova told CNN about facing Russian and Belarusian athletes. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a right to be at the Olympics \u2026 because every one [of them] is guilty in some way.\u201d Like Tkachuk, Ryzhykova has had to spend time away from Ukraine while she trains and competes, basing herself in the Italian city of Brescia during the summer months. But being away from her family home in Dnipro isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cHome is my safe place where I can recharge, relax, where I feel good, where I can really rest between competitions or in my training life,\u201d says the 34-year-old, a 4x400m relay bronze medalist at the 2012 London Olympics. \u201cIn the training camps, it\u2019s totally different in other countries; it\u2019s good, some countries are really amazing, but it\u2019s not my native (country). I can\u2019t relax fully there.\u201d Ryzhykova has learned not to read the news on the days she has a competition, which means finding different ways to distract herself whenever thoughts of the war enter her mind. \u201cI use books, novels or something easier,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I have bad thoughts, I\u2019m going back to this novel, and [thinking], OK, what is my character doing? I need to concentrate on this. It\u2019s my plan for competition day.\u201d CNN\u2019s Svitlana Vlasova contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_sport_soccer-player-jewish-teenager-germany-spt-intl", "text": "After Germany hosted the England soccer team in May 1938, Rolf Friedland waited patiently outside the stadium. The teenager was hoping to speak to some of soccer\u2019s biggest stars of the time \u2013 a feeling of anticipation that many sports fans have experienced. But for the German-Jewish 17-year-old, a lot more was at stake. Friedland knew that one of the soccer players who lined up that day had the power to save his life. And it was with the help of an England defender that Friedland was able to leave Germany, escape the persecution of the Nazis and start a new life overseas as Ralph Freeman. \u2018They\u2019re going to kill me\u2019 Freeman\u2019s family had already fled Germany without him, and he was left alone and isolated, knowing that leaving the country was essential for his survival. \u201cPsychologically, he was desperate to get out,\u201d Ralph\u2019s son Alan Freeman told CNN. \u201cHe was left there alone presumably with some sort of hope that his parents would be able to get him out, but I don\u2019t think he entirely relied on that.\u201d A lifelong soccer fan, Freeman\u2019s desperation to leave Nazi Germany led him to the Olympiastadion on that fateful day on May 14, 1938. He hatched a plan to try and gain the attention of an England player who could aid in his escape from Germany. \u201cI think that my dad was a creative individual and to do something like that, you need a degree of creativity,\u201d explains Alan. \u201cWhile there was a certain element of creative initiative, I think that it [the plan] was principally done out of desperation,\u201d he added. \u201c\u2019I just need to get out,\u2019\u201d said Alan of his father\u2019s attitude. \u201c\u2019I\u2019ll find any way to try and get out of it. If I don\u2019t get out of here, they\u2019re going to kill me.\u2019\u201d When the players made their exit from the stadium, it was England and Tottenham Hotspur defender Bert Sproston who stopped and listened to Freeman. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that he especially singled out Bert Sproston as the most likely person to help him,\u201d Alan said. \u201cHe simply spoke to that particular player and that particular player registered my father\u2019s desperation. \u201cIt obviously touched his heart and he decided to go back and do something about it.\u201d While Sproston would not have known the exact details of what life was like for a Jewish person living in Germany at the time, author and journalist John Leonard thinks he would have been aware of the Nazis\u2019 hostility towards Jews. In his book \u2018Salute!\u2019 Leonard looks at the how sport and politics clashed during this time \u2013 culminating in this famous match. \u201cI\u2019m sure he did realize that for Jewish people in Germany that, to put it politely, they were in for a hard time,\u201d Leonard told CNN. Michael Berkowitz, professor of modern Jewish history at University College London, agreed. \u201cEveryone was aware of it,\u201d Berkowitz told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s again important not to read backwards, but people did know that there was something going on that was just not normal by the standards of other places.\u201d After speaking to Sproston, who took his details back to Britain, Freeman was granted a visa to the UK to watch England play in a friendly game. He was finally able to leave Germany and avoid the events that would soon unfold. \u2018A crucial year\u2019 Europe was on the brink of war when England headed to Berlin in 1938.Geopolitical tensions were nearing a boiling point on the continent and Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party\u2019s power continued to grow throughout Europe. As the Nazis\u2019 influence increased, the treatment of the Jewish population of Germany dramatically worsened. \u201c1938 was a really crucial year,\u201d Berkowitz said. This was the year which saw the German annexation of Austria, commonly known as the Anschluss, in March as well as Kristallnacht \u2013\u00a0the night of broken glass\u00a0\u2013 in November of that year. Berkowitz explained that Hitler cautiously ramped up his abhorrent treatment of Jews after he came to power in 1933 but 1938 saw conditions dramatically worsen. \u201cIncluded in the annexation of Austria is incredible anti-Jewish action, including the burning of synagogues and Jews being beaten up on the streets,\u201d Berkowitz added. \u201cBut then even more striking was \u2026 what would later be called Kristallnacht,\u201d Berkowitz said. \u201cAlmost all of the synagogues in Germany were burnt down, literally hundreds, thousands of people beaten up in the streets [and], it was thought at first that there weren\u2019t that many people killed, now we know that there were many more people killed.\u201d According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, at least 91 Jews were killed, 30,000 German Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps and hundreds of synagogues were set on fire during the events of November 9 and 10 1938. \u201cThat was when the world really woke up. Unified in horror at what the Nazis were up to,\u201d Leonard said. Thanks to Sproston\u2019s intervention, Freeman was able to board a train from Berlin and arrived in London just a matter of weeks before the events of November 9-10 unfolded. \u2018He saved his life\u2019 Sproston\u2019s connections through the footballing world proved to be vital in helping Freeman leave Germany. \u201cYou usually would need some sort of personal connection. You need someone to vouch for you, or you need to come in through some sort of organizational effort,\u201d Berkowitz said of the process of obtaining a visa to leave Germany as a Jew. \u201cBut just say purely as an individual or an individual without means.Wow. This is not easy to do.\u201d Sproston sponsoring Freeman\u2019s UK visa therefore proved invaluable to ensuring his escape from Germany. \u201cNot only did Bert Sproston change Ralph Freeman\u2019s life. He saved his life,\u201d Leonard added. \u201cWithout his intervention the chances were that young Ralph Freeman would have ended up in a concentration camp, and he would have been murdered by the Nazis.\u201d Leonard also said that unlike the majority of his England teammates, Sproston could look back on this game with a sense of pride. It was before this game that the England players famously performed the Nazi salute prior to kick off. Leonard stated that the England team was under considerable pressure to perform the Nazi salute as a form of appeasement but, by helping Freeman, Sproston can feel less guilty about the pre-match salute. \u201cHe [Sproston] was one of the players who left Berlin, after making a personal decision, as much as a team decision, that would haunt most of the players for the rest of their lives \u2013 he certainly could look back on that game with a touch of pride,\u201d said Leonard. \u2018The world would be a better place\u2019 Sproston passed away in 2000 and Ralph Freeman passed away in 2010, but Ralph\u2019s son Alan said the pair remained close after their first interaction. \u201cTo the day that Bert died they were in contact,\u201d Alan explained. Alan added that the pair were always pleased to see each other, and this good relationship has been passed on to the next generation as Alan keeps in touch with Janice, Sproston\u2019s daughter-in-law. Alan said he and Janice have a \u201cdeep, meaningful relationship and a friendship,\u201d built on the legacies and stories of their father and father-in-law. A love for football, and in particular Tottenham Hotspur, was also passed down from father to son and Alan fondly remembers following Tottenham with his father. But more importantly, so did the story of Bert Sproston helping Ralph Freeman in his bid to leave Nazi Germany. \u201cI just think that if all of us could just act with decency to other people in the way that Bert behaved towards my dad, then the world would be a better place,\u201d Alan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/sport/soccer-player-jewish-teenager-germany-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Multiple United Nations officials have described harrowing scenes\u00a0in the crowded strip following large-scale Israeli strikes in recent days, including of child amputees unable to receive medical treatment after being bombed in so-called safe zones. Meanwhile, the UN chief said the devastation was \u201cincomprehensible and inexcusable\u201d and reiterated calls for the fighting to end. \u201cWe never lived in fear like this. There was blood everywhere,\u201d Gaza resident Ruwaida Issa told a CNN stringer at a school sheltering displaced people that was hit by a double Israeli missile strike on Sunday. \u201cWe were running looking for our children; remains of people were scattered all over the yard\u2026 We came here to shelter for nothing. There is no safety here. We want this war to stop; we can\u2019t bear this anymore.\u201d Israeli attacks across parts of Gaza killed at least 60 Palestinians on Tuesday \u2014 including a five-year-old child \u2014 according to local health officials, in the latest barrage of assaults. Since October 7, almost 70% of schools run by the UN\u2019s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza have been hit, the organization warned. More than nine months\u00a0of Israel\u2019s bombing campaign has turned once-lively neighborhoods into hollow wasteland, triggered mass displacement, crushed the health system and depleted critical supplies. \u201cYoung children were sitting here safely, each one sitting in his mother or father\u2019s lap,\u201d one eyewitness in Nuseirat, central Gaza, told CNN. \u201cSuddenly, missiles fell and tore them apart. Their remains flew on the walls and everywhere. There is no safety wherever you go.\u201d The Israeli military said early Tuesday it had struck about 40 \u201cterror targets.\u201d CNN cannot independent verify the IDF statements. Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed 38,713 Palestinians and injured another 89,166, according to the Ministry of Health there. Since Friday, Israel has launched waves of deadly missile strikes and attacks on what it called \u201cterrorist\u201d targets in central and southern Gaza as its military hunts down Hamas\u2019 leadership with the aid of US-made munitions. On Sunday, the Israeli military claimed to have targeted Hamas\u2019 military chief\u00a0and killed a Hamas brigade commander in an airstrike in Khan Younis.\u00a0It came as Israeli intelligence services said dozens of Hamas operatives involved in the October 7 attacks on Israel had been killed in the past week following \u201cintensified activity\u201d in Gaza. CNN cannot independent verify IDF statements. The human toll from Israel\u2019s weekend bombardment has been devastating. The strike targeting Hamas\u2019 military chief\u00a0hit a displacement camp in Al-Mawasi, which had been designated by the Israeli military as a safe zone for Palestinians fleeing the fighting elsewhere, killing at least 90 people and injuring 300, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. CNN has no way of verifying the casualty numbers reported by the ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants killed. Overwhelmed hospitals struggled to cope with the dead and wounded. One senior staffer at UNRWA, the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, described the Nasser hospital, which took in casualties of the strike, as \u201cthe most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.\u201d \u201cI saw toddlers who are double amputees, children paralyzed and unable to receive treatment, and others separated from their parents,\u201d said Scott\u00a0Anderson, director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza, in a\u00a0statement. \u201cParents told me in despair that they had moved into the \u2018so-called humanitarian zone\u2019 in the hope that their children would be safe there.\u201d The following day, at least 22 people were killed in a double Israeli missile strike that used US-made munitions on the Abu Oreiban school in the Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, where hundreds had taken refuge. The Israeli military claimed its air force struck the location where \u201ca number of terrorists\u201d\u00a0were operating. But Nuseirat residents told CNN mainly women, children and the elderly were sheltering at the school, which had been turned into a shelter run by UNRWA. \u201cWe are pulling a hand here and a leg there from under the rubble. Civilians who did nothing wrong,\u201d one man interviewed by a CNN stringer at the scene said. \u2018Where should we go?\u2019 Following the strikes on the school in Nuseirat, where thousands of displaced people are sheltering, families and UNRWA teams were helping to clean through the rubble. In the school yard, displaced families were hanging up their laundry but inside, crying women sat on the floor mourning their loved ones \u2014 torn clothes and rubble lay in piles in the yard. An injured woman and a girl in bandages cooked between the classrooms, while families and children stood in line for donated meals, carrying pots and plates and begging a man for some rice. \u201cWe are scared \u2026 My daughter was injured, my husband\u2019s children were all injured. The place we were sheltering in all collapsed on us,\u201d Mary Al Sammouna, a displaced woman from Gaza City, told a CNN stringer. \u201cThey are targeting everything; houses, human beings, stones, they didn\u2019t spare anything. But we are staying here even if we will die here. A person cannot leave his home twice; we have no other place to go to.\u201d Samir Tafesh, a displaced man from Gaza City, said those sheltering at the school are trying to get back to some kind of normalcy following the Israeli attack. \u201cWe are cleaning now, thank God we are still alive after the heavy bombardment, and we are trying to get back to normal life. We call for a ceasefire from both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are afraid that bombardments can happen again and again, but where should we go? We have no other place but this school; it is the safest for us,\u201d he added. Fresh pressure on negotiations The latest Israeli strikes have put new pressure on the success of ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations, which hit yet another roadblock last week. In a post on X Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres decried the violence in the strip and renewed calls for Israel and Hamas to agree a\u00a0long-touted deal for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. \u201cThe extreme level of fighting and devastation in Gaza is incomprehensible and inexcusable. Nowhere is safe. Everywhere is a potential killing zone,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cIt is high time for the parties to show the political courage and political will to finally reach a deal.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who has repeatedly vowed to eliminate Hamas \u2013 claimed the targeting of the group\u2019s military chief Mohammed Deif would improve the chances of a deal to free hostages, rather than harm them. \u201cHamas is weak. The more you hit it, the more you push for a deal,\u201d he told Israel\u2019s Channel 14 on Monday. It remains unclear if Deif died in Saturday\u2019s strike. The Israeli military is verifying whether he was killed while Netanyahu acknowledged it is uncertain whether he died.

{"id": "2024_07_15_uk_bristol-suitcase-murders-man-charged-intl", "text": "A man has been charged with two counts of murder following the discovery of human remains at a famous bridge in southwest England. Yostin Andres Mosquera, a 34-year-old Colombian national, was arrested in Bristol early Saturday and charged on Monday, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The remains were found in suitcases at Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol last week, as well as at Mosquera\u2019s address in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, a neighborhood in west London. The two victims have been named as Albert Alfonso, 62, and Paul Longworth, 71. The two men had previously been in a relationship and still lived together at the London apartment. Mosquera had also been staying with them in the apartment for a short while, police said. Longworth was British and Alfonso was originally from France but had obtained British citizenship.

Police said the evidence gathered so far \u201cdoes not suggest there was a homophobic motive in this case\u201d but, following national guidelines, have provisionally categorized the incident as a hate crime.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Millions of people have been displaced by floods, landslides and heavy rains in recent weeks across the region, which is home to about a quarter of the world\u2019s population and among the most vulnerable to the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis. Flooding from annual monsoon rains is common in South Asia but the climate crisis has turbocharged extreme weather events across the region, scientists say, with prolonged and intense heat waves giving way to record rainfall and storms. At least 40 people were killed and 347 injured in flooding from heavy rains in eastern Afghanistan, the health ministry said on Tuesday. In India, 97 people have died in flooding in northeast Assam state since May, official figures showed. Large-scale floods in northeast Bangladesh have impacted more than 2 million people. And flash floods and landslides in Nepal have killed dozens, according to the NGO Nepal Centre for Disaster Management (NCDM). The prolonged downpours have swollen rivers to beyond danger levels, critical infrastructure has been damaged, roads have been inundated and homes and crops destroyed across South Asia. In Afghanistan, storms have destroyed many homes, the health ministry said Tuesday, leaving displaced residents without access to basic necessities. About 1,500 children have lost their homes, according to Save the Children. The children\u2019s organization said the storms damaged a reception center in Torkham, which was set up to support some of the 650,000 Afghans who have returned to the country since September 2023, after being forced out of Pakistan in a crackdown on migrants. Bridges and roads have also been destroyed by the floods, according to the International Rescue Committee, which said it has deployed emergency health and response teams to the worst affected areas in Nangarhar province to help the injured and those cut off by the storms. \u201cThe continuation of climate-induced disasters in Afghanistan ought to be cause for grave concern,\u201d said IRC Afghanistan director Salma ben Aissa in a statement. \u201cDecades of conflict and economic crisis has meant that the country has faced setback after setback as it tries to find its feet. The sad reality is that without a massive increase in support from donors and the international community, many more will lose their lives.\u201d Region under threat The floods come just two months after major flooding and rainfall in northeast Afghanistan killed more than 300 people and destroyed over 1,000 homes, according to the Word Food Programme. In Nepal, at least 115 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced since May as record rainfall and flash floods inundated parts of the Himalayan country. Last week, a landslide swept away two buses carrying 65 people, prompting a huge search operation to locate 55 missing people in Chitwan, about 86 kilometers (53 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu, Reuters reported. \u201cIt is predicted that over 2 million people across 400,000 households will be impacted by flooding this monsoon season as Nepal is expected to receive above average rainfall and it is only the beginning of the season,\u201d Bishal Nath Upreti, NCDM president told CNN Wednesday. Heavy rains and floods have also hit much of India\u2019s northeast, east and northwest coast and followed weeks of blistering heat, with one part of Delhi reaching 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in late May \u2014 the capital\u2019s highest temperature on record. In flood-hit Assam, more than 1,000 villages across half of the state had been hit by floods and 15,000 people have sought shelter in relief camps as of Tuesday, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said. In Assam\u2019s Kaziranga National Park, at least 213 animals, including 12 rhinos, have been killed in flooding, a government bulletin said Wednesday. Since June, more than 2 million people have been impacted by flooding in Bangladesh\u2019s northeast, including 772,000 children, according to state media and humanitarian agencies. The mass displacement caused by prolonged rain and widespread floods has raised concerns of malnutrition and deadly waterborne diseases, particularly in children. International development organization BRAC said flooding in the country is \u201cbecoming more dangerous\u201d with \u201chuge losses to livelihoods, biodiversity and infrastructure \u2014 and interruption to schooling and health services.\u201d The seasonal monsoon rains are vital for quenching fields, nourishing crops, and replenishing reservoirs. But studies have shown monsoons are becoming more erratic due to the climate crisis, posing significant risks to critical sectors such as agriculture, water, and energy. The extreme weather and flooding across South Asia have renewed calls for immediate climate action and put added focus on how vulnerable people who have least contributed to rising global temperatures are being hit hard by the climate crisis. \u201cThe large economic disparities in the South Asia region have only magnified the sufferings of the most vulnerable and marginalized communities, with a large death toll and displacement figure year on year,\u201d said Marta Schaaf, program director for climate, economic social justice and corporate accountability at Amnesty International, in a statement Monday. \u201cThese communities contributed almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions, yet they are paying for government inaction on climate with their livelihoods and all too often \u2013 their lives.

She wrote on the GoFundMe page that Slater \u201chad met two people on Sunday night\u201d and left to go to their apartment, which was \u201cin a very secluded location.\u201d She said Slater left the apartment at 8 a.m. local (3 a.m. ET) and walked for half an hour, before \u201cfrantically ringing me when his phone reached 1%.\u201d \u201cHis last location was on an off road track, which was a 10 hour walk from his hotel,\u201d Slater\u2019s friend said. LBT Global, a charity that supports British nationals in crisis overseas, said in a post on Facebook that it was \u201csaddened to announce that a body found in Tenerife does look to be that of Jay Slater.\u201d \u201cIt is understood the body was found close to the site of his mobile phone\u2019s last location,\u201d the charity said. \u201cAlthough formal identification is yet to be carried out, the body was found with Mr Slater\u2019s possessions and clothes.\u201d Britain\u2019s Lancashire Police said the Guardia Civil had notified them \u201cthat they have found the body of a man and that the indications are that this is\u00a0Jay\u00a0Slater.\u201d \u201cWhile at this stage no formal identification has been carried out our thoughts are very much with\u00a0Jay\u2019s family at this time, and we continue to offer them our support,\u201d it added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/europe/jay-slater-search-body-scli-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

A rare flash flood emergency was issued for around 5,000 people in Yellville and surrounding areas of Marion County after 6 to 11 inches of rain fell in just four to five hours, according to the National Weather Service. The area typically receives just 3.5 to 4 inches of rain in the entire month of July.

Only around 40 flash flood emergencies are issued on average each year, but Wednesday\u2019s was the 48th this year. It has since expired. At least 30 homes and a nursing facility in the county were evacuated as the dangerous floodwaters hit the area, Melissa Penn, Marion County Emergency Management Director, told CNN. Approximately 80 patients from the nursing home were transported to a temporary facility. At least one bridge in Marion County was washed out by flooding, according to the county\u2019s social media.

Ultra-Orthodox Jews, or Haredi, have traditionally been exempt from military service so as to be able to study the Torah. But a Supreme Court ruling in June said the Israeli government must enlist draft-age ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military, reversing a de facto exemption in place since the country\u2019s founding 76 years ago. The move sparked fierce protests among Haredi communities. Shas described summons for military service as outrageous, and added: \u201cThe Great Rabbis have instructed, categorically, that as of now, as a new law defining the status of Yeshiva students has not been passed, there shall be no response to any summons or even summons for a first order, and therefore, not to show up to the recruitment stations.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s our duty now to stand strong, like a wall that can\u2019t be breached, and make clear for the world to know, that there\u2019s no force in the world that will, God forbid, succeed in detaching the students of the Torah from their studies.\u201d The IDF said this week that it will begin issuing initial summonses on Sunday to those designated for security service from among the ultra-Orthodox sector \u201cfor screening and evaluation processes in preparation for the recruitment\u201d for the upcoming year. The IDF said it \u201cworks to recruit to its ranks from all parts of this society in light of the conscription obligation in the state of Israel, by virtue of being the people\u2019s army and in light of the increased operational needs at this time, in view of the security challenges.\u201d The announcement sparked further protests. Nine people were arrested Tuesday for blocking a highway. On Monday, senior IDF officers were assaulted by dozens of ultra-Orthodox protesters, who threw bottles and other objects at them, after they\u2019d had a meeting in Bnei Brak. The commander of the IDF Training Command, Major General David Zini, and Major General Shay Tayeb, were attacked at the end of a meeting with Rabbi David Label, who has been working in recent days to establish the ultra-Orthodox division in the IDF. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition relies on two Haredi parties \u2013 United Torah Judaism and Shas \u2013 to govern. Netanyahu has been trying to advance legislation through Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, that would enshrine in law a draft exemption for Haredi men.

{"id": "2024_07_17_china_china-stabbings-economy-crime-intl-hnk", "text": "The fatal stabbing of two people by a man at a residential compound in southern China has ignited\u00a0an online debate\u00a0that has amplified during a summer scarred by a spree of similar crimes across the country. Two days after those June 28 killings in the Guangxi region, national attention shifted to another stabbing incident, thousands of miles away \u2013 which was then followed by two others, also unrelated attacks in public places, taking the toll to seven dead in four provinces within two weeks. The circumstances differed in each case; one perpetrator had been in a drunken argument, while another has a history of mental illness, according to police. All cases remain under investigation, and scant information has been released on the suspects or their motives. The country of 1.4 billion has generally low violent crime rates and very tight gun controls. But China has been rocked by a number of high-profile stabbing cases in recent decades, including multiple\u00a0such attacks at schools. What stands out about the latest stabbings is the social media debate triggered by them, which experts say reflects a growing sense of anxiety and discontent that has spread across the nation in recent years as the country\u2019s economy struggles to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second largest, has been plagued by myriad problems including a property crisis, weak spending, regulatory crackdowns and high youth unemployment \u2013 with economists fearing it could face years, if not decades, of stagnation. These worries were clear on Chinese social media after the latest attacks, with several commentators connecting China\u2019s dire economic circumstances to the violence, even as the attackers\u2019 motives remained unclear. \u201cWe should be nicer to others, especially given the economy is not doing well these past two years,\u201d one user wrote on the X-like platform Weibo. \u201cMany people are struggling and their emotions are unstable.\u201d Many others echoed this sentiment. \u201cTry not to argue with people outside,\u201d another Weibo user wrote. \u201cYou never know if they are unhappy in life and can take it out on others.\u201d Experts caution that these messages don\u2019t necessarily reflect the reality of those stabbings \u2013 authorities haven\u2019t released much information about the suspects besides their age and gender. We don\u2019t know anything about their personal lives or financial backgrounds and in some cases it\u2019s unclear whether their attackers knew their victims. The stabbings this summer have garnered significant online attention, for example one related hashtag viewed more than 64 million times on Weibo. That\u2019s even as\u00a0overall violent crime in China \u2013 already extremely low compared to many other countries \u2013 has been declining in recent years, according to state media reports. Instead, it\u2019s possible the online speculation could mirror the public\u2019s own concerns as the economic slump drags on, said Michelle Miao, an associate law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. \u201cNormally when people are reflecting on these issues, when they are making their own interpretations of social events, they are using this event \u2026 to reflect their own emotions, their own thinking \u2026 as a mirror of the current social reality,\u201d she told CNN. Rare violent crime Two of the most high-profile recent attacks came in June \u2013 and both targeted foreign nationals. One involved the stabbing of four visiting US college instructors, while the other saw an attacker stab people at a bus stop near a Japanese school. Ultra-nationalism has risen across China and Chinese social media in recent years, as has anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiment. But Chinese authorities have been keen to play down any suggestion that these attacks specifically targeted foreigners. \u201cSuch isolated incidents may happen in any country in the world,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular news briefing after the attack on the Japanese school bus, which killed a Chinese woman who tried to stop the attacker and injured a Japanese woman and her child. According to Chinese authorities, the American instructors and a Chinese tourist who intervened had been stabbed after one of the instructors \u201ccollided\u201d with the attacker while walking. They added that China would continue protecting the safety of foreigners in the country. The suspects in both attacks were unemployed, according to a police report on the bus stop case and one of the US instructors, citing Chinese officials. The Chinese government doesn\u2019t provide detailed data on knife attacks and keeps a tight lid on crime in its powerful and ubiquitous surveillance system. China only recorded 0.46 homicides per 100,000 people in 2023, state media reported, citing the Ministry of Public Security. According to the World Bank, citing the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)\u2019s International Homicide Statistics database,\u00a0there was just one intentional homicide per 100,000 people in China in 2020 \u2013 compared to seven in the US. The UNODC says the homicide rate per 100,000 people for Asia stood at 2.3 and at 15 for the Americas in 2021, the most recent available figures. A 2023 work report by the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate, which oversees legal prosecutions, claimed that China had curbed serious violent crimes and crimes related to guns, explosives and drugs in the previous five years, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Gun violence is rare in China, where the regulation of firearms is among the strictest in the world. Chinese law generally prohibits private possession of firearms (except for hunters with permits), and the government has stepped up its policing of illegal firearms in recent years. Stabbings have, however, made headlines in recent years \u2013 often shining a light on the need for greater mental health services in China, as suspects are often described to have been living with a mental illness, according to official announcements. Several have targeted schools \u2013 including a 2020 knife attack at an elementary school, and attacks at or near kindergartens in 2022 and 2023. Miao at CUHK said the situation in China today \u2013 compared with other countries and unlike in the late 1970s and 1980s when China faced momentous societal changes and an accompanying crime wave \u2013 did not seem to show a \u201csignificant pattern of rising crimes.\u201d There have, however, been Chinese studies showing a correlation between crime rates and economic indicators such as unemployment. Youth unemployment hit record highs last spring; at one point, more than one in five people aged 16 to 24 were jobless. That rate has since lowered, according to the government\u2019s latest data, which now uses a different metric to calculate youth unemployment. At the same time, other economic crises deepened, including the real estate\u00a0collapse \u2013 which caused defaults and sparked protests across the country. As local governments struggled with financial difficulties, some cities\u00a0cut basic services or reduced medical benefits for seniors. On social media, the belief that economic insecurity is making the country less safe remains palpable. China\u2019s financial pressures had been \u201cpassed on to everyone layer by layer,\u201d one Weibo user wrote after the Guangxi stabbing. \u201cDon\u2019t let yourself become a victim of the economic environment,\u201d they said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/china/china-stabbings-economy-crime-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_china_china-trump-assassination-attempt-reaction-intl-hnk", "text": "As dramatic images of the failed assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump spread around the world Saturday, news of the attack also sparked immerse online interest \u2013 as well as pointed criticism of the US \u2013 on China\u2019s heavily censored internet. Discussion of the assassination attempt, in which a gunman opened fire at a Trump campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday evening, dominated Chinese social media in the hours after the attack. Related hashtags garnered hundreds of millions of views on China\u2019s X-like social media platform Weibo, where Trump \u2013\u00a0who as president played an outsized role reframing the US-China relationship into the more contentious one that exists today \u2013 has for years been a frequent subject of discussion, fascination and often ridicule. Some social media users were quick to hail former president and presumptive Republican US presidential nominee as \u201clucky\u201d that he didn\u2019t sustain more serious injury and praised Trump\u2019s \u201cquick reflexes,\u201d while many others made quips about how the situation\u00a0would boost his re-election bid. Trump, who said he was shot in the ear, was declared safe following the incident. As shots rang out during his speech at the rally, the former president ducked to the ground and was covered by Secret Service agents. He then raised his fist in a defiant pose with blood visible on his face before agents took him off the stage \u2013 a gesture captured in an image widely shared worldwide and in China. \u201cJust judging by his quick reaction and agility to duck, I\u2019d vote for Trump. I bet (US President Joe) Biden would take ages to crouch down,\u201d read one social media comment that got thousands of likes and appeared to allude to concerns about Biden\u2019s age. One blogger with over a million followers noted that the incident made Trump look more like a \u201ca traditional Hollywood president.\u201d Other commentators made morbid parallels between the incident and the 2022 assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, for example noting\u00a0that the two ex-leaders did not end up \u201cmeeting\u201d over the weekend. There were also repeated\u00a0links made\u00a0between the attack and recurring instances of gun violence in the United States, which are often highlighted by Chinese state media as an example of the country\u2019s failings. \u201cIn the land of liberty, gunshots ring out every day,\u201d said one comment on Weibo with several thousand likes, while another said Trump would be \u201cconfirmed as the next president with gunfire.\u201d China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs put forward an official comment Sunday, with a spokesperson saying Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u201cexpressed sympathy\u201d to Trump. State-linked media also stepped in to shape public discussion around the incident. Several op-eds or editorials published by such outlets framed Saturday\u2019s violence as a symptom of American democracy, echoing Beijing\u2019s longstanding rhetorical push to portray the US political system as dysfunctional and inferior to its own. An editorial published by the state-linked Beijing News on Sunday claimed the incident\u00a0had \u201ccombined all the political symbols typical of an American election: violence, uncertainty, and tough guys.\u201d State-run nationalist tabloid Global Times on Monday published an op-ed from a Beijing-based professor describing how \u201cthe escalation of political polarization into violence shows that more people are feeling hopeless about American democracy.\u201d \u201cPolitical polarization and violence stem from severe income inequality and hopelessness about social change,\u201d the piece said, while the outlet\u2019s English-language arm repeated similar themes in an editorial for international audiences. As such commentary filtered across China\u2019s media, Biden, in an Oval Office address Sunday evening, took aim at what he described as \u201cforeign actors\u201d who \u201cfan the flames of our division. Their aim is\u00a0\u201cto shape the outcomes consistent with their interests, not ours,\u201d Biden said\u00a0in an apparent reference to Washington\u2019s concern that China, Russia and other rivals are playing on existing social divisions in the US in influence campaigns, something Beijing denies. \u201cTonight, I\u2019m asking every American to recommit \u2026. (to) think about what\u2019s made America so special,\u201d the US president said. The rapt focus on the attempted assassination in China adds to what has already been frequent discussion of Trump on the Chinese internet, where he earned the nickname \u201cChuan Jianguo,\u201d or \u201cTrump, the (Chinese) nation builder\u201d during his time in office \u2013 a quip to suggest his isolationist foreign policy and divisive domestic agenda were actually helping Beijing to overtake Washington on the global stage. Trump\u2019s re-election bid is also believed to be watched closely in Beijing, not least because the former president has threatened, if re-elected, to raise tariffs that experts say could trigger a de facto decoupling between the US and Chinese economies \u2013 a shock that would hit as China grapples with numerous internal fiscal challenges.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/china/china-trump-assassination-attempt-reaction-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Trevor Ball, who was a senior explosive ordnance disposal team member in the US Army, agreed that the images likely showed part of the fin of a small-diameter bomb. Ball told CNN there were also fragments of a US-made Hellfire missile at the site, including the top of the guidance system. \u201cIt\u2019s likely there was a different munition involved as well, as there is minimal damage on the rooftop from the later strike from what pictures I saw.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/middleeast/us-munitions-israeli-strike-gaza-school-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_this-man-built-a-plane-for-his-family-in-his-garden", "text": "It wasn\u2019t until he moved near to an airfield in the UK over a decade ago that mechanical engineer Ashok Aliseril Thamarakshan began to seriously consider learning to fly a plane. He got his first taste of flying a few years later, when his wife Abhilasha bought him a 30-minute flight experience for his birthday. Aliseril, who is based in Essex, England, booked in some flying lessons at a local airfield and flew to the Isle of Wight, an island off the English south coast, during his first session. \u201cThat was quite an eye-opener into how (flying) gives you the freedom to just go places if you have that ability, and access to an aircraft,\u201d he tells CNN Travel. \u201cSo that really got me hooked.\u201d Aliseril got his private pilot\u2019s license in 2019 and soon began hiring planes for short flights. Amateur build But as his family grew \u2013 he and Abhilasha now have two daughters \u2013 the two-seater planes typically available for private hire became even less suitable, and he began to mull over the idea of buying his own plane. Aliseril briefly considered buying an older aircraft, and looked at some that had been built in the 1960s and 1970s. However, he says he felt uneasy about the prospect of flying his family in an older aircraft that he wasn\u2019t familiar with, and didn\u2019t think it would be a \u201ccomfortable journey.\u201d Aliseril began to look into the possibility of building a plane himself, reasoning that this would allow him to gain a better understanding of the aircraft so that it would be easier to maintain in the long term. After researching self-assembly aircraft kits, he came across a four-seater plane manufactured by South African company Sling Aircraft that ticked all the right boxes. In January 2020, Aliseril flew to the Sling Aircraft factory facility in Johannesburg for the weekend in order to take the\u00a0Sling TSi aircraft\u00a0on a test flight and was so impressed that he decided to purchase it. \u201cThis was pre-Covid, where travel was still very easy at the time,\u201d he explains. \u201cI ordered the first kit when I got back. And by the time it arrived, the UK was in full lockdown.\u201d Aliseril says his colleagues, some of whom had experience with building aircraft, initially offered to help with the build. But the restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, which had spread across the world by this point, meant that this wasn\u2019t possible. Undeterred, he constructed a small shed in his back garden and planned out the different stages of the project, which would be monitored by the\u00a0Light Aircraft Association, a UK representative body that oversees the construction and maintenance of home-built aircraft, under an approval from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The rules for amateur built aircraft differ slightly from country to country. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has an\u00a0experimental airworthiness category\u00a0where special airworthiness certificates can be issued to kit-built aircraft. Amateur-built airplanes in the UK are investigated by the CAA, who will issue a \u201cPermit to Fly\u201d once satisfied that the aircraft is fit to fly. Although the start of the build was delayed slightly due to the Covid-19 restrictions in place in the UK at the time \u2013 the Light Aircraft Association inspector assigned to the project was required to visit his working space beforehand \u2013 Aliseril was able to begin in April 2020. While he notes that his engineering background helped in some ways, he believes that it was actually his home improvement experience that proved most useful while constructing the aircraft, which has a length of 7.175 meters and a height of 2.45 meters. \u201cThese aircraft kits are designed for any amateur to build, provided you\u2019re a bit hands-on and you\u2019ve got experience working with some specialist tools,\u201d he adds, describing the detailed \u201cIkea furniture type instructions\u201d with drawings that came with the kit. \u201cI would say generally, anyone can get involved in these sorts of builds.\u201d Lockdown project Aliseril completed the work himself, drafting in Abhilasha to assist with some of the sections that required more than one pair of hands. Their eldest daughter Tara, now nine, was on hand for tasks such as removing the plastic from each of the components. By the end of summer 2020, Aliseril had built the tail and the wings. He began constructing the fuselage section in October, when the next part of the kit arrived. Although he\u2019d initially planned to hire a workshop to construct the aircraft, Aliseril feels that creating a workspace at his home was the better choice. \u201cI could just step into the shed and work on it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo having everything just in the back garden really helped, even though space was tight.\u201d Each stage of the project had to be signed off by an inspector before he could move onto the next task \u2013 the Light Aircraft Association completed around 12 inspections in total. Once the majority of the components were constructed, and it was time to put the aircraft together, Aliseril moved everything from his home to a hangar near Cambridge for the final assembly and engine fit. The aircraft passed its final inspection a few months later. It was one of the first Sling TSi homebuilt aircraft constructed in the UK. G-Diya, named after his youngest daughter, was signed off for its first flight in January 2022. Aliseril recalls waiting on the ground anxiously as a test pilot took the plane he\u2019d spent 18 months building up into the air. \u201cHe took it up for about 20 minutes, and then he came back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a big relief. I couldn\u2019t lift my head up to see what was happening (during the test flight).\u201d That first flight was hugely significant in many ways. \u201cWith these build projects, everyone calls it a project until it\u2019s first flown,\u201d he explains. \u201cOnce it\u2019s flown, it\u2019s always called an aircraft. You never call it a project anymore. That\u2019s psychologically a big step.\u201d When it was time to fly the aircraft for the first time himself, Aliseril was accompanied by another experienced test pilot. While he admits to being decidedly cautious, the test pilot was \u201cthrowing the aircraft about as if it was a racing car.\u201d \u201cI was feeling very nervous, I didn\u2019t want to put any extra stress on it,\u201d Aliseril explains. \u201cBut (the test pilot) was really pushing it to the limits. And it was good to experience that. I know that (the aircraft) can handle this much. \u201cOnce I landed, (the test pilot) clapped his hands and said \u2018Congratulations, you\u2019ve just landed the plane you built.\u2019 That was a great feeling.\u201d G-Diya, which has a range of 1,389 kilometers, went through a number of further test flights before it was issued with a permit to fly in May 2022. The following weekend, Aliseril flew with his wife and daughters Diya and Tara, five, to the Isle of Wight, where they took a short taxi ride from the airfield to the beach. \u201cThe kids were really happy,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that sort of freedom. And the fact that we could just do that on a Saturday and still be back by 4 p.m. That was a great feeling.\u201d They continued taking trips together within the UK, flying to Skegness, a seaside town in eastern England and the village of Turweston in Buckinghamshire, before Aliseril felt comfortable enough to take them a little further afield. Last Easter, the family, who\u2019ve been documenting their trips on their\u00a0Instagram account, fly_home_or_away, traveled to Bergerac, France, which Aliseril describes as their \u201cmost memorable\u201d trip together. According to Aliseril, G-Diya has flown over 300 hours in the past two years, traveling as far as Norway. Family trips For Aliseril, one of the main benefits of the plane, aside from the freedom it provides him and his family, is the friendships he\u2019s formed with other pilots. He was always mindful that owning an aircraft could become a financial burden, but has been able to get round this by working out an arrangement to share it with three others. \u201cTo get your private license, it costs quite a bit,\u201d he adds, before noting that many of those who\u2019ve taken on similar projects are either retired, or are people \u201cwho have the time and financial status\u201d to fund the process. \u201cI kind of knew that from the beginning, and thought I\u2019d take that risk and try to do it myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew that once it was done, I would easily be able to find people to share that cost. And it\u2019s worked out quite well (for me).\u201d \u201cIt becomes a communal thing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always have somebody to fly with if your family is not available. Also, having other pilots who are friends \u2013 you learn from each other.\u201d Now that the aircraft is split equally between four people, \u201cit\u2019s only costing us around the price of an SUV,\u201d adds Aliseril. \u201cIt\u2019s more fuel-efficient in the air \u2013 it only takes about 20 liters of unleaded fuel per hour of flight,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the fuel costs are pretty much equal to driving.\u201d As for the cost of the build, the kit was priced at around \u00a380,000 (about $91,000,) according to Aliseril, while added costs including avionics, as well as the plane\u2019s Rotax engine, propeller and other supplies, brought the total up to around \u00a3180,000 (around $203,000). There was no hangar space at the airfields close to his home, so Aliseril decided to build a new hangar for the plane at an Essex airfield. The new hanger was completed in early 2023. Aliseril says he hopes that more young people will take on projects like this in the future, and points to shared aircraft ownership as a way to make things more cost-efficient, as well as form connections in the aviation world.

{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_kenya-murders-arrest-confession-intl", "text": "A suspected serial killer has confessed to murdering 42 women over the past two years, police in Kenya have said, in a shocking case that has sparked calls for increased measures to combat gender-based violence in the country. Authorities said Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, \u201clured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies,\u201d of which only nine have been recovered. He was arrested in Soweto, east of the capital Nairobi, at 3 a.m. local time on Monday, outside a club where he had gone to watch the Euro 2024 soccer final, Kenya\u2019s director of criminal investigations,\u00a0Mohamed Amin,\u00a0told journalists on Monday. \u201cOn interrogation, the suspect confessed to having lured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies at the dumping site, all murdered between 2022 and Thursday, 11 July, 2024,\u201d Amin said. Acting police inspector general, Douglas Kanja, added in a statement that the \u201cpost-mortem examination is happening today\u201d on the nine bodies recovered so far. In a news conference on Sunday before the suspect\u2019s arrest, Kanja said the bodies \u201cwere severely dismembered, in different states of decomposition, and left in sacks.\u201d \u201cWe are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for life,\u201d Amin said Monday. Khalusha \u201cled officers to his single room rented house,\u201d which is located about 100 meters (328 feet) from the crime scene, Amin said. A machete, 12 nylon sacks, a pair of industrial rubber gloves, a hard drive, and eight smart phones were among \u201ccrucial\u201d items police said they discovered in the rented house. Amin said that, according to the suspect\u2019s confession, his first victim was his wife, whom he \u201cstrangled to death before dismembering her body and disposing it at the site.\u201d \u201cFrom his interrogation, all his victims have been murdered in like manner,\u201d he said. Khalusha\u2019s arrest followed \u201cforensic analysis of a mobile phone belonging to one of the victims, Josphine Mulongo Owino, where mobile money transactions conducted on the day she went missing pointed to the suspect,\u201d according to Amin. The first six bodies were discovered on Friday by residents\u00a0of Kware, in Nairobi\u2019s Mukuru kwa Njenga neighborhood.\u00a0Kenyan Police\u00a0said the bodies were found in an \u201cabandoned quarry,\u201d currently \u201cfilled with water and used as a dumpsite.\u201d On Monday, police said the suspect lived a short walk from the dumpsite, raising questions about how he evaded detection for two years. The site is also close to a police station. A group of female leaders called for enhanced protections for\u00a0Kenyan women on Monday after increasing cases of femicide. \u201cThose women might have been killed today, but which woman is next in line?\u201d asked Kajiado lawmaker Leah Sankaire Sopiato at a press briefing. \u201cIt is so sad that someone who killed 42 people was still roaming out there.

{"id": "2024_07_12_style_dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon", "text": "Pristine, crisp and all-white \u2014 tennis whites have been a tradition dating back centuries. The distinctive look has not only made the racquet sport stand out, it has also become a sartorial mainstay off the courts, too. And even though most of the major tournaments have done away with the hueless uniformity, Wimbledon, the very first of them, has remained strict in its policy (as have many private clubs around the world). The prestigious championship even clamped down on the rule a decade ago, prohibiting colorful accents that had become increasingly common \u2014\u00a0 the year after Roger Federer\u2019s now-infamous pair of orange-soled sneakers were banned after his first round in 2013. The rules once called for \u201cpredominantly white\u201d outfits, allowing some competitors to play with color combinations, such as Serena Williams\u2019 tribute to Wimbledon treat strawberries and cream in 2010. But the crackdown changed the wording to \u201calmost entirely white,\u201d per the organizers: no off-white, no panels of color, no varying colorways on sneakers. The only recent loosening of rules was in 2023, to allow women to wear dark-colored shorts on the court following criticisms that the rules weren\u2019t accommodating for menstruation leaks. But why did tennis whites become the standard? The reasons often cited are practical ones, from heat reflection to sweat-masking. But senior curator Kevin Jones of the ASU Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (ASU FIDM) Museum in Los Angeles, who organized the recent traveling exhibition \u201cSporting Fashion: Outdoor Girls 1800 - 1960,\u201d said it really comes down to a long history of clubs enforcing social status, starting when lawn tennis skyrocketed in popularity in Victorian-era England as a leisure sport \u2014 and a rare one that allowed women, too. \u201cIt\u2019s completely elitist because white clothes are difficult to maintain,\u201d he said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cAnd the types of materials that these dresses were made of, which were cottons and linens, creased easily, so to keep them nice and freshly starched was also an aspect of that care.\u201d Challenging the rules Of course, tennis style has drastically changed in a century-and-a-half since it first became a recreational sensation for the upper class, hot off the heels of croquet (and utilizing the same neatly trimmed lawns). Early tennis attire was more akin to 19th-century leisurewear: women wore striped and patterned garments with long skirts, corseting and wide-brimmed hats; men donned wool pants, button-downs or sweaters. Because spectators and players have often adhered to similar styles, fashion and tennis have had a \u201cmutual exchange over time, where various tennis trends have seeped into wider culture as well,\u201d said sports journalist Ben Rothenberg, author of \u201cTennis: The Stylish Life\u201d as well as a recent biography on Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s been more than apparent in the past few months as Zendaya turned out a series of tennis-inspired high-fashion red-carpet looks matching the on- and off-court drama of the film \u201cChallengers,\u201d and recently faced Federer in an \u201cair tennis\u201d match for a campaign by the sportswear brand On. The close alignment with fashion has also led to the success of classic tennis-born labels such as Lacoste and Fred Perry, as well as radical new fashion innovations introduced on the court, like Elsa Schiaparelli dressing Spanish player Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez in culottes, a split skirt, for Wimbledon in 1931, to onlookers\u2019 shock. Like with De \u00c1lvarez, dress codes in tennis have often changed after an initial scandal. The French player Suzanne Lenglen was one of the earliest and most memorable cases, when she did away with layered, long dresses and wore a more airy calf-length skirt and shorter sleeves at Wimbledon in 1919. A muse to the designer Jean Patou, Lenglen became tennis\u2019 first fashion icon with her signature headscarf and then-provocative shorter hems. At the US, French and Australian Open, players have challenged definitions of what tennis clothes can be thanks to looser rules (subject to referee opinion). None have done so more than the Williams sisters, with Serena wearing a denim mini, tutus and cape-like silhouettes and Venus\u2019s lacy black-and-red ensemble that drew comparisons to lingerie. More recently, Serena Williams\u2019 Nike kit became the topic of conversation at the 2018 French Open when she opted for a black compression catsuit that didn\u2019t feature the compulsory tennis skirt. Though she cited its circulation benefits following a severe blood-clot scare with the birth of her child, the French Open said it would bar the style in the future. However, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association formally allowed it, and Williams continued to wear versions of the bodysuit at the 2019 and 2021 Australian Opens, normalizing the agile and simplified cut for the tennis court. \u201cI love wearing skirts,\u201d she told CNN in April while reflecting on the controversy. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure that my blood was always circulating and I had been in a near-death experience.\u201d \u201cSo I think there should have been\u2026 understanding around that whole outfit,\u201d she added. Brand distinctions Most of the Grand Slam tournaments dropped the all-white rules decades ago, likely in a bid to attract more television viewers and advertisers in an age of increased visibility for the sport. \u201cColor is vital to draw the eye and especially for those sports companies to be able to advertise their logos and their colors,\u201d Jones explained. Sports and luxury brands advertise through fashion in multiple ways, from dressing star players in custom statement pieces to promoting merchandised designs on competitors. Wimbledon\u2019s restrictive rules have been \u201cfrustrating\u201d for brands trying to sell their tournament collections, Rothenberg said. When Fila introduced Bjorn Borg throwback shirts in 2001, replicating what the tennis star wore during his five-time-winning Wimbledon streak from 1976 to 1980, Wimbledon officials said they no longer adhered to the rules. The decision sent the sports brand \u201cscrambling\u201d to get new shirts to the players wearing them, Rothenberg explained. And, after Federer\u2019s orange-soled shoes were banned, Nike had to act fast to spin their brief appearance, advertising them as \u201cOne Match Wonders\u201d in a print ad. For players, the smallest infractions have proved controversial, and some players have outright refused to play along, as Andre Agassi did from 1988-90 when he boycotted Wimbledon entirely. In 2017, Jurij Rodionov was told to change blue underwear that was peeking out of his shirts, while Sabine Lisicki recently said that she and women were often required to switch out their skin-colored bras. But Rothenberg doesn\u2019t see more leniency happening anytime soon from Wimbledon\u2019s decision-makers. \u201cI think Wimbledon sees its anachronisms as a big part of its brand and its value,\u201d he explained. \u201cWimbledon has clung on to it as a way to be distinct and different \u2014 and I think it\u2019s largely been successful. It doesn\u2019t look like any other tournament.\u201d There have been criticisms levied against the major tournaments whenever women players seem to be disproportionately affected by their dress codes, and though Rothenberg agrees, he also points out that women\u2019s styles have been more creative. Men\u2019s tenniswear has deviated less from shorts and lightwear polos or shortsleeve athletic shirts since they were introduced. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of men\u2019s short length getting markedly shorter over the last 12 months though, especially players who really have hiked up their shorts a lot,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe someday there will be rules against that if they start showing too much cheek.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled a source\u2019s surname and misstated the current name of the ASU FIDM Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_europe_crossbow-attack-violence-women-bbc-journalist-intl-gbr", "text": "Figures from across the United Kingdom have offered their condolences to a BBC sport commentator, after his wife and two daughters were killed by an alleged crossbow attacker, in deaths that again drew attention to the epidemic of violence against women. Carol Hunt, 61, wife of BBC horse racing commentator, John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, died from injuries sustained in an attack in Bushey, just northwest of London, on Tuesday, according to police and Britain\u2019s public broadcaster. A 26-year-old suspect wanted in connection with the killings, and named as Kyle Clifford, was found by British police in Enfield, north London, on Wednesday, following a sprawling manhunt. There were no previous reports to the force over Clifford, who is in serious condition in hospital and is yet to speak with officers, Hertfordshire Police said in a statement. A crossbow was recovered as part of the investigation, which police believe was used in a \u201ctargeted incident.\u201d Epidemic of violence against women The killings of the three women rocked Britain, where mass murders are infrequent but violence against women and girls has been officially labeled as a national threat. A woman is killed by a man every three days in the UK and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem,\u00a0said earlier this year. Charities and human rights organizations have subsequently reiterated urgent demands to tackle femicide in the UK. \u201cMale violence against women and girls is at epidemic levels,\u201d said SafeLives, a UK-based charity working to end domestic abuse, adding: \u201cDomestic abuse is a major public health crisis. It should be given the same priority as terrorism.\u201d Refuge, a UK-based non-profit providing support for survivors of domestic abuse, posted on X: \u201cOur thoughts are with Carol, Hannah and Louise Hunt and their family and friends following the devastating incident in Bushey.\u201d British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called the attack \u201ctruly shocking,\u201d adding that she is \u201cbeing kept fully updated\u201d by authorities. The country\u2019s new Labour government campaigned on a manifesto to \u201ctackle the scourge of violence against women and girls\u201d in Britain, including a review of the sentencing process, and requiring forces to target repeat offenders with tools used for counter-terror and serious organized crime investigations. \u2018His life was ripped apart\u2019 An array of BBC journalists paid tributes to their colleague, in an outpouring of grief across the organization and wider sports industry. BBC Sport presenter Mark Chapman said: \u201cJohn\u00a0Hunt\u00a0is our colleague, and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live Sport team, but to all of those who have worked here with him over the past 20 years. \u201cOn behalf of everybody connected to 5 Live Sport, our love and thoughts and support are with\u00a0John\u00a0and his family,\u201d Chapman said live on air. Dan Walker, who used to host the BBC show Football Focus,\u00a0posted on X\u00a0that: \u201cJohn\u00a0Hunt\u00a0is one of the best and his life was ripped apart yesterday.\u201d Tim Peach, a producer for BBC Cricket, described\u00a0Hunt\u00a0as \u201cone of the kindest, most thoughtful people I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s peerless at his job,\u201d Peach said on X, \u201cbut he\u2019s always happiest talking about \u2018my Carol\u2019 and \u2018my girls.\u2019\u201d Michael Owen, a former soccer player and racehorse owner,\u00a0also posted\u00a0on X following England\u2019s soccer win at the European Championship, writing that \u201cwhile the country celebrate(s), spare a thought for\u00a0John\u00a0Hunt. I can\u2019t remember feeling so utterly horrified in years. Those poor girls. Truly horrific.\u201d The British Horseracing Authority (BHA)\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that its thoughts are with\u00a0Hunt, his family, and friends. \u201cIt is impossible to comprehend the horror that has been inflicted upon them by this dreadful event,\u201d Julie Harrington, the BHA chief executive, said. Ascot Racecourse, one of Britain\u2019s most famous horse-racing grounds, said that it echoed the BHA\u2019s words and posted that\u00a0\u201cour thoughts are with\u00a0John\u00a0Hunt\u00a0at this tragic time.\u201d Crossbow legislation in the UK The strength of crossbow laws in the UK was called into question last year, after a British man was incarcerated for breaking into Windsor Castle and planning to assassinate the late Queen Elizabeth II with the weapon in 2021. At the time, the former Conservative government did not change the legislation, despite launching an eight-week review of the rules and the possibility of introducing a licensing scheme. In Britain, it is legal for a person to buy or own a crossbow if they are over 18, though anyone who carries one in public without a reasonable excuse can face imprisonment.  Crossbow attacks in the UK are rare, with fewer than 10 homicides by crossbow between 2011 and 2021, according to the government. The British home secretary is now re-examining the country\u2019s crossbow laws, according to her colleague, security minister Dan Jarvis. \u201cWe are seized by the seriousness and the importance of this,\u201d Jarvis told the BBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday, adding that the new government has \u201cmade a manifesto commitment\u201d to halve violence against women and girls in Britain over a 10-year period. \u201cWe will move as quickly as we possibly can to reach a judgement about whether we do need to amend the existing legislative framework,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2015_07_20_travel_shark-attack-how-to-survive", "text": "First things first. Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon. But sharks do occasionally attack humans \u2013 and they certainly make news when they do: \u2022 A man was recovering in mid-July after being bitten by a shark off Key West in Florida \u2022 A 14-year-old boy was bitten in the leg by a shark at a\u00a0North Carolina beach\u00a0in late June 2024. \u2022 A lifeguard and surf instructor, who also appeared in \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,\u201d died after an apparent\u00a0shark\u00a0attack on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii, in late June 2024. \u2022 Florida fire officials asked beachgoers to exercise caution in early June 2024 after three people were injured in two separate shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other at neighboring Walton County beaches. \u2022 A woman was bitten by a bull shark in Sydney Harbour not far from the city\u2019s iconic Opera House in January 2024. And a Russian citizen was killed by a shark in the Red Sea in Egypt on June 2023. While these kinds of encounters understandably cause would-be ocean swimmers to worry, there\u2019s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines. The Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s International Shark Attack File found just 69 confirmed, unprovoked shark attacks on people and 36 confirmed bites worldwide in 2023. That compares with 57 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 32 bites in 2022. Think about it a minute \u2013 the world population is more than 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And that\u2019s all the shark attacks recorded. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher. In 2023, the United States once again led the way in unprovoked attacks in 2023 at 36; Florida had the highest state total at 16. That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel. Before you get in the water Know your environment Sharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,\u201d said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.  \u201cFortunately, humans aren\u2019t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.\u201d Still, there are places you\u2019re more likely to encounter a shark.  River mouths are not the best place to swim You should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.  Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks. \u201cAn awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river \u2013 people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,\u201d said Peirce. Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out. Avoid areas with fishing Before you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says \u201cforget it.\u201d \u201cWhether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,\u201d he said.   Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That\u2019s a possible sign a shark might be nearby. He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore. Avoid dusk and dawn Swimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it\u2019s also the time when a shark attack is most likely. \u201cA lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,\u201d Peirce says, \u201cdue to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.\u201d Hang with lifeguards Chris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to \u201cdo your homework\u201d before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places. If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.  \u201cI always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It\u2019s a lot safer,\u201d he said. Don\u2019t wear shiny objects in the water \u201cBe careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.\u201d Lowe said. In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.\u201d Follow your instincts \u201cProbably the most important thing is to follow your gut,\u201d Hammerschlag said. \u201cIf you feel wary about getting in the water \u2026 just don\u2019t go in the water.\u201d \u201cA lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn\u2019t listen to it,\u201d he said. If a shark is nearby Don\u2019t panic So you\u2019re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic. \u201cDon\u2019t start splashing around \u2013 you\u2019re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark\u2019s interest,\u201d said Peirce. Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose. \u201cA shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it\u2019s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we often get exploratory bites which don\u2019t result in death and sometimes don\u2019t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you\u2019re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.\u201d Maintain eye contact As the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact. \u201cSharks are ambush predators,\u201d Peirce explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it\u2019s not going to be half as comfortable as if it\u2019s able to sneak up from behind.\u201d Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you\u2019re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore. If you\u2019re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. \u201cLet the shark know it\u2019s being watched.\u201d Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,\u201d Fragola says in the video. Stay big or get small This is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.  \u201cThe bigger you are in the water, the more respect you\u2019ll get,\u201d he said. But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce\u2019s advice is to roll up into a ball. \u201cIf a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor \u2013 and if it wasn\u2019t showing massive interest in me \u2013 I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.\u201d If you\u2019re being attacked Don\u2019t play dead This isn\u2019t a bear, it\u2019s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots \u2013 but be careful where you aim. \u201cThere\u2019s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That\u2019s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThis is a moving object in the water and you\u2019re not staying still either, so what you don\u2019t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.\u201d A good shot to the gills can also do the job: \u201cThe gills are very sensitive \u2013 giving a shark a whack in the gills isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201d Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you\u2019re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,\u201d Peirce says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it\u2019s (been) enough to use a shark billy \u2013 a small metal rod between two and three feet long \u2013 and I\u2019ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.\u201d It\u2019s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you\u2019ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten. Cut off the angles If you\u2019re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can\u2019t get behind you, says Peirce. \u201cKeep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you\u2019ve only got one direction to look. You\u2019re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.\u201d Slowly back away Displace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore. \u201cYou must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you\u2019ve got to be careful \u2013 large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.\u201d Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim. \u201cIf a white shark is in full attack mode, there\u2019s not much you\u2019re going to be able to do at that point,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2015/07/20/travel/shark-attack-how-to-survive/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_europe_western-weapons-ukraine-russia-intl-cmd", "text": "Bankir and his men have been trying to fight off Russian attacks along the Ukrainian front lines for more than two years. But it\u2019s only now that they are finally able to strike where it hurts: Inside Russia\u2019s own territory. The newly granted permission by the United States and other allies to use Western weapons to strike inside Russia has had a huge impact, Bankir said. \u201cWe have destroyed targets inside Russia, which allowed for several successful counteroffensives. The Russian military can no longer feel impunity and security,\u201d the senior officer in Ukraine\u2019s Security Service (SBU) told CNN. For security reasons, he asked to be identified by his call sign only. After many months on the back foot because of ammunition and manpower shortages, Kyiv is finally able to take full advantage of Western military aid that started to flow into the country last month, after months of delays. Soldiers on the front lines say the deliveries are beginning to make a difference \u2013 especially since they can now use the arsenal to strike across the border at certain military targets supporting Russia\u2019s offensive in Ukraine. \u201cWe can see the impact of the aid every day. Artillery, longer-range multiple launch rocket systems with various types of ammunition and submunitions\u2026 it\u2019s affecting the overall battlefield picture,\u201d Ivan, an officer with the 148th artillery brigade, told CNN. He also asked for his full name not to be published for security reasons. \u201cWe are deploying the most effective weapons systems in the areas where the Russians are trying to break through the defensive lines and there has been a significant slowdown in the Russian advance,\u201d he added. While Kyiv hasn\u2019t managed to reclaim large swathes of territory, it has successfully averted what could have been a disaster: The occupation of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second city. \u2018Tragic moment\u2019 Part of the northern Kharkiv region, including the cities of Izium, Kupiansk, and Balakliia, fell into Russian hands soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The occupation was brutal. When the area was liberated in the fall of 2022, Ukrainian troops found evidence of what they say were war crimes committed by Russian forces, including multiple mass graves and torture chambers. In May this year, Russia launched another cross-border attack on the region, trying to exploit Ukraine\u2019s ammunition shortages before the expected arrival of the first Western weapons. The consequences were deadly. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said that at least 174 civilians were killed and 690 were injured in Ukraine in May, the highest number of civilian casualties in a year. More than half of the civilian casualties were in Kharkiv \u2013 even though the region encompasses a relatively small area compared to the whole country. International security expert Oleksiy Melnyk, a former Ukrainian defense official and the co-director of foreign relations and international security programs at the Razumkov Center in Kyiv, told CNN that the re-occupation of previously liberated areas north of Kharkiv was a \u201ctragic moment\u201d for Ukraine. But it also marked a major turning point. \u201cIt triggered a change in the position of our Western partners, it encouraged them to, at least partially, remove the restrictions on the use of the Western weapons,\u201d he said. Fearing an escalation, the US and other Western allies had long prohibited Kyiv from using their weapons to strike inside Russia, restricting their use to Ukrainian areas under Russian occupation. That has allowed Russia to use the border areas as safe staging grounds for offensives and missile attacks. \u201c(Russia) knew that Ukraine did not have the capacity to strike these targets on the Russian territory,\u201d Melnyk said. \u201cIf the decision (to provide aid) wasn\u2019t made, if we lost American support and military assistance, that would have been a game changer.\u201d But the possibility of Russian re-occupation of parts of Kharkiv region convinced some of Ukraine\u2019s key allies, including the US, to lift the restrictions. This allowed Kyiv to hit and destroy or severely damage key targets inside Russia. According to Ukrainian defense authorities, these included a regiment command post in Belgorod region, an ammunition depot in Voronezh, a drone facility and an airfield in Krasnodar, communication centers in Bryansk and several naval sites in occupied Crimea. The arrival of long-range ATACMS missile systems was a particular game-changer, Melnyk said. While Ukraine was previously able to strike targets inside Russia using Ukraine-made drones, ATACMS make these strikes far more efficient. \u201cSpeed matters,\u201d Melnyk explained. \u201cWith drone strikes, Russians have hours to react, because they can detect Ukrainian drones early. Russian pilots can have a coffee and a cigarette before jumping into the cockpit and taking off to take it down. With the ATACMS, it\u2019s a matter of minutes,\u201d he said. Konrad Muzyka, an independent defense analyst  and the director of\u00a0Rochan\u00a0Consulting who has recently returned from eastern Ukraine, said Russia is also no longer able to target Kharkiv region with S-300 and S-400 missile systems. \u201cUkraine started conducting HIMARS strikes on targets in the Belgorod region and forced the Russians to push their S-300 system with which they were striking Kharkiv much further away, so\u00a0now Kharkiv is beyond their range of Russian S-300 systems,\u201d he said. While Russia switched to aerial glide bombs \u2013 guided munitions with pop-up wings dropped by fighter jets from a distance of some 60-70 kilometers \u2013 out of range of Ukraine\u2019s air defenses, the elimination of the S-300 threat has provided at least some relief to Kharkiv. Weapons without men, men without strategy? But while the new weapons are making some difference, Ukraine is long way off being able to push Russian forces off its territory. Another officer with the 148th separate artillery brigade who goes by call sign Senator told CNN that there is still a lot more that Ukraine needs. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough to turn the tide at the front. Enough to hold the enemy back, yes, but not enough to change the situation dramatically,\u201d he said. \u201cThe enemy is now exhausted but not destroyed,\u201d he said, pointing to the fact that Russia still has complete air superiority over Ukraine. Kyiv is now pinning its hopes on the deliveries of F-16 fighter jets which should start soon \u2013 the first Ukrainian pilots were set to complete their training in the US this summer. But Muzyka said it is far from certain the jets will bring a massive change to Ukraine\u2019s fortunes. \u201cThe F-16s are combat aircraft from 1980s and 1990s and their capabilities are worse than the most modern Russian combat aircraft,\u201d he said, adding that the newest Russian jets would likely prevail in an air battle with the F-16. However, Ukraine can still use the F-16 to deny Russia control over the skies \u2013 and push away Russian aircraft delivering bombs. Yet the new weapons are just part of the puzzle. \u201cIf it had not been for the supplemental package, Ukrainians would be in a much worse situation right now, but at the same time, the current situation is not only the result of a lack of actions by the US Congress, it\u2019s also the result of the decisions that were made and were not made in Kyiv, especially when it comes to mobilization,\u201d Muzyka said. \u201cThe decision to introduce a wider mobilization was probably as important, if not more important, and it came too late,\u201d he said. The new mobilization law, which requires all men between 18 and 60 to register with Ukraine\u2019s military, came into effect in May. He said that while Ukraine has managed to recruit a significant number of men over the past month and half, it will take time for these new soldiers to be trained up and ready for the front lines. \u201cUkrainians are going to be in a very difficult position until August, September, when the first mobilized guys start to enter the front line. If they can get to that point, then there is a big likelihood that they will manage to stabilize the situation from August onwards, but until this happens, more Russian gains are highly likely.\u201d Muzyka said that with the new weapons arriving and battalions and brigades getting a boost soon from the new recruits, Ukraine will need to decide on its next steps. \u201cIt is unclear what the plans are. What is the strategy for counteroffensives? The problem is that Ukraine is waiting to see what equipment the West can supply them with, and the West is waiting to see what plans Ukraine have for the future,\u201d he said. Time is of the essence here. Experts estimate that the $60 billion US aid package approved earlier this year will last for \u2013 at best \u2013 a year or 18 months. Ukraine\u2019s allies made fresh pledges on arms this week while at a NATO summit in Washington, DC, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for all restrictions on their usage to be lifted. Given the possibility of former US President Donald Trump winning a second term in November \u2013 he has little time to spare. Maria Kostenko and Daria Tarasova-Markina contributed reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_15_tech_google-wiz-acquisition", "text": "Google owner Alphabet is in advanced discussions to buy fast-growing cybersecurity startup Wiz for roughly $23 billion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. A takeover of Wiz, which makes cybersecurity software for cloud computing, would represent a major bet by Google on cybersecurity, marking the tech giant\u2019s biggest-ever acquisition. Discussions between Google and Wiz began after the startup raised $1 billion from venture capital investors earlier this year, the source said. Terms of a potential deal have not been finalized and talks could still collapse, according to the source. News of the Google-Wiz talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Neither Google nor Wiz returned CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The deal would easily surpass Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion about a decade ago, the biggest takeover in company history. Google offloaded Motorola just two years later for a massive loss. A $23 billion price tag on Wiz is nearly double the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. In March 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion as part of its efforts to help companies better address cyber threats and bolster its cloud computing business. Google Cloud is central to the company\u2019s efforts to diversity revenue beyond its core search advertising business. Although its cloud sales have grown, it has struggled to compete with similar services from Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon. Buying Wiz would be a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d at Microsoft and Amazon, showing that Google is making a \u201cmajor bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship offering in the cloud,\u201d Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at\u00a0Wedbush, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Cloud security has become especially important in recent years as companies have spent heavily to move data to cloud platforms. Just last week, AT&T revealed that nearly all of its wireless customers\u2019 call and text records were exposed in a massive breach caused by an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform. The Google-Wiz deal talks come despite intense antitrust scrutiny under the Biden administration of tech giants. However, that antitrust scrutiny could be dialed back somewhat if Trump once again takes hold of the White House, Ives said, making the Federal Trade Commission \u201cmuch weaker\u201d and sparking an \u201caccelerated merger and acquisition environment to take place for Big Tech.\u201d If the acquisition gets finalized and closes, it would mark a massive exit for Wiz and its founders \u2014 Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik. The four executives met years ago when they were drafted into Unit 8200, the cyber intelligence division of the Israel Defense Forces. Since starting up in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York City-based Wiz has enjoyed explosive growth. Today, the company says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its clients. Notable customers include BMW, Slack and Salesforce, and it works with major cloud companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/tech/google-wiz-acquisition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_style_ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian", "text": "India\u2019s most anticipated wedding of the year came to an end on Sunday after a star-studded three-day celebration that even saw the country\u2019s prime minister arrive to bless the young couple. Billionaire heir Anant Ambani married his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant in Mumbai in a lavish ceremony attended by Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, two former British prime ministers, Indian sporting legends and some of Bollywood\u2019s most famous faces. The wedding was followed by a blessing ceremony on Saturday, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi bestowed the young couple and their families with well wishes. The weekend\u2019s festivities concluded Sunday with an extravagant reception, or \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d (festival of bliss), as attendees jetted out of Mumbai. No expense was spared by the family that owns India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. The Ambani-owned 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Centre, which hosted wedding events throughout the weekend, was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, featuring floral installations and extravagant sets embellished with gold and silver. The couple underwent multiple outfit changes across the three-day bash, appearing in a succession of intricate, custom-made pieces celebrating the country\u2019s heritage and culture. Merchant\u2019s bridal ensemble was designed by Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and featured ivory zardozi (an elaborate type of metal embroidery) on silk and a 5-meter (16.4-foot) veil. She completed the look with jewels that aunts and sister wore to their own weddings. She later changed into an opulent red and gold outfit for her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family. Ambani meanwhile arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers. For the marriage ceremony, he wore a custom red sherwani by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, with a large green necklace draped around his neck. For Saturday\u2019s blessings ceremony, Merchant once again donned a custom piece by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, who collaborated with contemporary artist and sculptor Jayasri Burman to create a one-of-a-kind piece embroidered with real gold. The garment celebrates the couple\u2019s union \u201cthrough deeply meaningful imagery,\u201d Merchant\u2019s stylist Rhea Kapoor wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe human figures representing the happy couple radiate a celestial aura that honors the divinity in their humanity. The fauna depicts Anant\u2019s fondness for animals, particularly elephants that are considered auspicious and beautiful.\u201d For the reception Sunday, guests interpreted the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code by mixing classic Indian fashion with contemporary styles. Merchant wore a gold metallic corset from Dolce and Gabbana\u2019s Alta Moda couture line, along with a skirt and dupatta in the same shade by Indian designer Anamika Khanna. Months of planning It is not known precisely how much the Ambanis spent on the celebrations, which included months of pre-wedding parties, though industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Insiders worked for months to bring the couple\u2019s vision to life, collaborating with the family to bring the intricate details \u2014 from the floral arrangements to the set designs \u2014 together. Renowned wedding designer Preston Bailey, who has worked with Serena Williams and LeBron James, was commissioned to create larger-than-life floral art installations for the weekend. Speaking to CNN via email ahead of Friday\u2019s ceremony, Bailey commended Ambani\u2019s mother Nita\u2019s attention to detail. It was \u201cnothing short of pure genius and she is really focused on bringing the vast creative talent of India to the world through these weddings,\u201d he said. The inspiration for Bailey\u2019s designs came from the couple\u2019s love for animals and Ambani\u2019s recently opened animal sanctuary, Vantara, in the western Indian city of Jamnagar. His sculptural creations included a giant display of hot air balloons and more than 60 floral animals, including giraffes, two huge toucans, monkeys perched on trees inside the venue and a giant horse made from red and pink flowers. \u201cI have been in business for over 40 years \u2026 (but) I have never seen anything as intricate as this wedding and I believe it will bring such positive feedback and awareness to the great creative culture of artists of India,\u201d said Bailey, who also worked on the weddings of Ambani\u2019s two older siblings, Akash and Isha. Top Indian couturier and the wedding\u2019s creative director, Manish Malhotra, earlier told CNN that \u201cmaintaining the essence of India\u201d had been his \u201cguiding principle.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet (a traditional evening of music and dance that saw a performance from Justin Bieber) to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he said via email. Criticism and sustainability Details of the celebrations dominated local news headlines and set social media abuzz, but many within India \u2014 the world\u2019s most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people \u2014 criticized the opulence on show in a country with a glaring wealth gap and where millions live in poverty. \u201cShame on people celebrating income inequality in a country where we need wealth redistribution,\u201d tweeted comedian and social media critic, Shamita Yadav, who posts on social media as The Ranting Gola. \u201cWe are really a poor country,\u201d Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, Sushant Singh, told Indian news outlet The Wire. \u201cThis is something which is completely unacceptable. But the fact of the matter is half of India\u2019s big media is owned by Mr. Ambani, so it is unlikely that India\u2019s big media is going to say that this is horrible.\u201d Beyond the financial cost of the wedding and festivities is another, less visible cost: the one to the planet. An average Indian wedding of 300 people typically generates between 1.5 tons and 2 tons of waste, and around 30 to 40 tons of carbon emission \u2014 before taking guest travel into consideration \u2014 according to Ashwin Malwade, co-founder of Greenmyna, a Mumbai-based sustainable wedding consultancy. Sources of emissions include large-scale banquets and energy used by extravagant light displays. An event as huge in scale as the Ambani-Merchant celebration would emit far more carbon than even the largest and most lavish Indian wedding, he added. Then there\u2019s the travel, with several high-profile attendees pictured leaving Mumbai via Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport\u2019s private jet terminal. Malwade also pointed to the environmental footprint of the Ambanis\u2019 pre-wedding bash in Jamnagar, attended by public figures from around the world, including Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump, Bill Gates and Karlie Kloss; the four-day cruise arranged for guests in the Mediterranean; and the emissions required to fly in singers like Rihanna and Justin Bieber to perform at various events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/style/ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_style_cloudboom-strike-spray-on-running-shoes", "text": "We\u2019ve seen spray-on hair, a spray-on dress and now \u2014 marathon-winning spray-on shoes. Swiss sportswear brand On is the latest company to embrace advanced \u201cspray-on\u201d materials with a \u201crevolutionary\u201d robot-made sneaker it believes can improve performance at this month\u2019s Olympics. The Cloudboom Strike LS is lace-free and weighs less than the latest iPhone. Designed to be more adaptable, dynamic and supportive than your average running sneakers, the $330 shoes already have a convincing track record: Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri, an Olympic silver medalist and the only woman to have won indoor, outdoor and cross-country world titles, triumphed at this year\u2019s Boston Marathon wearing a pair. She will don them again to compete in the Paris 2024 Games this summer. Zurich-based On credits its shoes\u2019 success to a combination of biomechanics, physiology and extreme lightness. (A men\u2019s US size 8.5 weighs just 170g per shoe, over 100g lighter than several popular running shoes of the same size.) \u201cMore than anything, we want (the athletes) to win,\u201d said senior director of innovation, Ilmarin Heitz, in a promotional video published Monday. \u201cThat is our gauge of success.\u201d With no heel-cap, laces or tongue, the translucent, sock-like sneaker looks like a running shoe that has shed its skin. Its inventor, Johannes Voelchert, came up with the idea as a student after seeing a Halloween-themed hot glue gun that shot decorative spider webs. \u201cI saw that there was a quick way of creating a textile onto a complex shape,\u201d Voelchert, now On\u2019s senior lead of innovation concept design, said in the brand\u2019s video. \u201cA shoe seemed to be the right object.\u201d Voelchert brought his idea to the Milan Design Fair, where he caught the Swiss sportswear brand\u2019s attention. According to On, the shoe\u2019s uppers (the material above the sole) are made from a type of thermoplastic and colored and branded in three minutes using just a robotic arm. The upper is sprayed in one go and can be attached to the carbon-fiber and foam rubber sole using heat, not glue. The company claims its technology reduces the carbon emissions of producing a shoe\u2019s upper by 75%, compared to its other sneaker models. The material, which it dubs LightSpray, has \u201cthe potential\u2026 to move us towards a more sustainable, circular future,\u201d said Marc Maurer, On\u2019s co-CEO, in a press release. Sprayed-to-measure The technology will be on display at a pop up in Paris later this month as people flock to the capital for the 2024 Olympic Games. And while it is not yet known if which athletes other than Obiri will wear them at the Games, a number of Olympians have recently raced in the Cloudboom Strike LS, including Australian middle-distance runner Olli Hoare. The brand told CNN via email that it hopes athletes going to Paris who have previously worn the shoes \u2014 such as Irish 1,500-meter runner Luke McCann \u2014 will \u201ccontinue to choose them this summer.\u201d On is not the first company to experiment with spray-on textiles. In October 2022, luxury French fashion house Coperni made headlines when it sprayed a custom-fit dress onto model Bella Hadid at Paris Fashion Week. The label partnered with Manel Torres, whose brand Fabrican has been producing \u201cclothes-in-a-can\u201d for over 20 years. Spray-on fibers have also been used in the beauty industry, with \u201chair in a can\u201d solutions used to conceal bald spots and thinning hair. Having initially been made available to the public in April, the Cloudboom Strike LS will again go on sale to consumers later this year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/style/cloudboom-strike-spray-on-running-shoes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_europe_trump-vp-jd-vance-europe-ukraine-intl", "text": "Many of America\u2019s closest allies were already dreading the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Now that the former president has picked JD Vance as his running mate, they potentially have a lot more to worry about. By choosing Vance, Trump has sent a clear signal that, if elected, his America-first foreign policy will be back in force. Vance, a junior senator for Ohio, is a staunch critic of sending support to Ukraine as it tries to defend itself against Russia. Like Trump, he has repeatedly criticized NATO and its European members for not spending enough on defense. And he has made a number of comments that have raised eyebrows across the pond \u2013 including when he said the United Kingdom would become the \u201cfirst truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon\u201d under the new Labour government. His nomination puts an end to the hopes by some of America\u2019s allies that Trump might soften his foreign policy stance if reelected. That hope was fueled by Trump himself. While he has often repeated his claim that he \u201cwould end the war\u201d in Ukraine in one day if reelected and said he would not send any more money to Kyiv, he stopped short of getting his allies in Congress to block the $61 billion aid package approved earlier this year. \u201cHe could have told members (of the Congress) not to vote for it and instead he tacitly allowed it\u00a0to go through,\u201d said Kristine Berzina, a geopolitics and security expert who leads the German Marshall Fund of the United States\u2019 Geostrategy North program. \u201cSo there was a sense in Washington that Trump has been in a fairly pro-Ukrainian moment, and that he should have the benefit of the doubt \u2013 perhaps his views on Europe and Ukraine have evolved, especially given the much higher defense spending in Europe now,\u201d she\u00a0told CNN in an interview. But with the selection of his running mate, Trump dashed these hopes. \u201cJD Vance does not appear to be interested in being a good ally to Europe,\u201d Berzina said. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance suggested Ukraine should negotiate with Russia because the US and other allies do not have the capacity to support it. Ukraine and NATO have dismissed that scenario, because it would most likely mean Kyiv would have to give up some of its pre-war territory. \u201cI think what\u2019s reasonable to accomplish is some negotiated peace. I think Russia has incentive to come to the table right now. I think Ukraine, Europe and the United States have incentives to come to the table,\u201d he said at the conference, adding that the fact that Putin \u201cis a bad guy does not mean we can\u2019t engage in basic diplomacy.\u201d On Wednesday, Russia welcomed Vance\u2019s stance on Ukraine. \u201cHe (Vance) stands for peace, for cessation of aid. We can only welcome this because, in fact, it is necessary to stop pumping Ukraine with weapons, and the war will end,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a press conference at the United Nations. Lavrov added that Russia \u201cwill be ready to work with any American leader elected by the American people\u201d as long as this leader \u201cis ready for an equitable, mutually respectful dialogue.\u201d In Munich, Vance notably skipped a key meeting between a bipartisan delegation of US senators and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d learn anything new there. He did attend a meeting with Zelensky in Washington in December but left early. Asked by CNN\u2019s Kaitlin Collins about Vance\u2019s assertion that the outcome of the war would not change even if Ukraine received US funding, Zelensky said Vance did \u201cnot understand what is going on here.\u201d \u201cTo understand it is to come to the frontline to see what\u2019s going on\u2026 without this support. And he will understand that millions of people will be killed,\u201d he added. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand it, of course, God bless you don\u2019t have the war on your territory.\u201d Pivot to China Vance has argued that the US should turn its focus away from Russia and toward\u00a0East Asia. Earlier this week, he said the war in Ukraine must be brought to a \u201crapid close\u201d so that America could focus on \u201cthe real issue, which is China.\u201d That\u2019s the \u201cbiggest threat to our country and we\u2019re completely distracted from it,\u201d Vance said in an interview with Fox News Monday. In an op-ed published in the New York Times in April, Vance also argued that US efforts to supply Ukraine with air defense systems could be detrimental to Taiwan\u2019s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing. \u201cThese weapons are not only needed by Ukraine. If China were to set its sights on Taiwan, the Patriot missile system would be critical to its defense,\u201d he wrote. The idea that East Asia, and China specifically, poses as big, if not a bigger, threat to the US than Russia is not unique to Vance. Trevor McCrisken, an US foreign policy expert and associate professor at the University of Warwick, said there is bipartisan agreement between Democrats and Republicans that China is the biggest threat internationally to US interests. \u201cBoth parties say you\u2019ve got to be strong, and you\u2019ve got to prevent China from fulfilling whatever ambitions it might have, economically, militarily, and so on. It\u2019s just that most Democrats and the more moderate Republicans believe that Russia is also a threat,\u201d he told CNN in an interview. In the eyes of most Western leaders, the threats from China and Russia go hand in hand. Just last week, NATO leaders called China a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine in the alliance\u2019s most forceful statement on Beijing\u2019s involvement in the conflict. \u201cTo have a rather simplistic view that if you back away from Ukraine that\u2019s going to help you with China, it might not be the case,\u201d McCrisken said, adding that Vance is likely trying to use his more anti-European stance for political reasons too. \u201cIt is a way of painting Europe as not standing up for itself when it should. Historically, the US has had to go in and bail out Europe so many times.\u201d Sam Greene, the director of the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) and a professor of Russian politics at King\u2019s College London, said Vance\u2019s nomination should make it clear to America\u2019s allies that the shift toward the Trumpian kind of Republican foreign policy is likely more long-term. \u201cThe last time we had a Trump presidency, I think Europeans looked at this as potentially a four-year blip, and then breathed a sigh of relief when Biden was elected and thought that we\u2019d return to normal \u2026 and I think that there was some wishful thinking in that, and people have now begun to recognize that,\u201d he said. The effect of this shift, Greene said, is apparent even now \u2013 despite the White House being in Democratic hands. US President Joe Biden had an extremely hard time getting the latest Ukraine aid package through Congress, forcing Ukraine\u2019s European allies to start thinking about a plan B. The initial delay in Congress approving the package resulted in a Czech-led initiative to find and fund alternative sources of ammunition for Kyiv, among other efforts to look for assistance elsewhere. \u201cThe unreliability of American leadership in Europe has been a fact that Europeans have now had some time to get used to. Even if Biden is reelected, America will be difficult to rely on,\u201d Greene said. If Trump chose someone with a more traditional foreign policy stance to be a running mate \u2013 for example the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, America\u2019s allies could have hoped that post-Trump, the Republican party might pivot back to what Greene called \u201ctrans-Atlantic solidarity.\u201d \u201cBut if in fact, not only are we looking at another Trump administration, but we\u2019re looking at a future of the Republican Party that is dominated by people like JD Vance, then that is a much more sobering prospect for Europe,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/europe/trump-vp-jd-vance-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "style_dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc", "text": "Not content with Dubai having the tallest building, the deepest pool or the highest hotel, urban design firm URB hopes to add one more superlative feather to the city\u2019s cap: the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway. URB has released conceptual designs for a 64-kilometer-long highway that would see Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road, one of the city\u2019s main traffic belts, transformed into a \u201cGreen Spine,\u201d complete with autonomous, solar-powered trams and smart traffic management. Baharash Bagherian, urban planner and founder of URB, believes the \u201cfirst-of-its-kind project\u201d would make the city\u2019s design more \u201chuman-centric.\u201d \u201cDubai is rapidly expanding, with its population expected to nearly double to 8 million by 2040,\u201d Bagherian told CNN in an email. \u201cThis growth necessitates creativity and innovation to address both current and future challenges.\u201d \u201cWe must view mobility as more than just the movement of people,\u201d he added. Smart tech and solar-power The autonomous solar-powered tram is just one aspect of the proposed highway\u2019s transport system: above the tram line, a network of green areas, parks and overpasses would increase connectivity and walkability of the city, which is currently tough to navigate on foot. The highway would also integrate smart technology, such as \u201cinternet of things\u201d (IoT) sensors, to manage traffic and optimize energy use. Bagherian\u2019s designs allow for 300-megawatt solar panels and a storage system to be embedded in the tracks, that would power the tram line, as well as generate clean energy for an estimated 130,000 homes. And the green spaces \u2014 including parks and community gardens \u2014 would provide space for one million trees, which would also help cool the city and improve air quality. \u2018A unique set of challenges\u2019 Creating the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway in a desert city isn\u2019t easy, though. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) already has one of the world\u2019s highest water consumption rates per capita, consuming around 550 liters per person, per day (compared to an average of 310 liters in the US, 150 liters in Hong Kong, and 144 liters in the European Union). Most of this isn\u2019t used as drinking water, but in agriculture and landscaping, and the country\u2019s green spaces use copious amounts of water. For example, Dubai Miracle Garden \u2014 a 72,000-square-meter park displaying 150 million live flowers \u2014\u00a0consumes 757,000 liters (200,000 US gallons) of water every day. \u201cDubai presents a unique set of challenges: its rapid growth, diverse population, urban sprawl, and extreme climate conditions,\u201d Bagherian said. To combat this, Bagherian\u2019s concept includes \u201cwater-sensitive landscape design\u201d that includes native flora and drought-resistant plants suited to the arid climate, and soil mixed with zeolite, an absorbent crystal that aids water retention. These \u201cpassive techniques\u201d are complemented with smart irrigation technology, he added, \u201cwhich use real-time data to adjust watering schedules based on soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and plant needs.\u201d An urban utopia This isn\u2019t URB\u2019s first foray into utopian future city design. Its proposal for \u201cDubai Mangroves\u201d \u2014 which it claims will be \u201cworld\u2019s largest coastal regeneration project\u201d if it goes ahead \u2014 was revealed earlier this year, and last year, it also proposed a 93-kilometer indoor cycling \u201csuperhighway\u201d called The Loop that could help residents in the emirate go car-free. Like the Green Spine, none of these designs have been confirmed. But Bagherian says that turning these conceptual designs into a reality isn\u2019t as tough as it looks. \u201cWhen you break down the components of the project, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s nothing new from a technological, structural, or material standpoint,\u201d he said, adding that the innovation lies in how these technologies are \u201ccreatively and seamlessly integrated to address multiple needs.\u201d The next step involves getting public sector entities onboard, to provide \u201cthe necessary support, regulatory framework, and infrastructure integration to bring this ambitious project to life,\u201d Bagherian said. He\u2019s optimistic that this will happen, as the project aligns with the government\u2019s 2040 Urban Master Plan, and creative urban planning is key to fulfilling those goals. \u201cDubai is uniquely positioned to make this project a reality,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
