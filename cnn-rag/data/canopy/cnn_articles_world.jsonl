The severe downpours have also left 2,400 tourists stranded in the northeastern Indian state of Sikkim. Six people died in India\u2019s Sikkim state and another four died from a landslide in neighboring Nepal\u2019s Koshi province, according to officials. \u201cIt\u2019s continuously raining since the past 36 hours \u2026 we have recovered the dead bodies and they have been handed over to the families,\u201d Hem Kumar Chettri, a district magistrate from Sikkim told CNN. At least 45 houses, roads, bridges and infrastructure had been \u201cbadly damaged\u201d by the rainfall, he added. Bordered between Bhutan and Nepal, the northeastern state of Sikkim is known for its scenic Himalayan landscapes, boasting 28 mountain peaks, 21 glaciers and more than 200 lakes. But like any mountainous region,\u00a0it is prone to deadly flash floods and landslides. Last year dozens of people\u00a0died\u00a0after a glacial lake in the state burst following torrential rain and scientists have warned extreme weather will become more frequent and more intense\u00a0as the human-caused climate crisis intensifies. Chettri said approximately 2,400 tourists are\u00a0stranded in various tourist spots in the state after landslides covered roads with debris and heavy rainfall damaged some bridges. \u201cThey are stranded but they are safe, we have spoken with hotel owners to house them till the weather improves, no one is on the roads \u2026 we have advised tourists to stay where they are,\u201d he said. State disaster response forces have been deployed to clear roads. \u201cThe damage is really bad so it will take time but hopefully within a week we will be able to restore connectivity,\u201d Chettri said. India\u2019s Meteorological Department\u00a0said\u00a0\u201coccasional intense spells of rainfall\u201d were very likely to continue over Sikkim on Friday. Neighboring West Bengal state has also been affected by flooding in recent days, with trees uprooted, buildings damaged and high water levels in the Teesta River. While the north grapples with torrential rains, India has endured a record long summer \u2014 with a part of the capital Delhi recording the country\u2019s highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 Fahrenheit) last month. Rising temperatures in the country also risk reversing progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/india/india-sikkim-landslide-deaths-tourists-stranded-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_europe_meloni-macron-italy-france-abortion-g7-intl", "text": "The crowning document from a meeting of G7 leaders in Italy has been released with a veiled reference to abortion after French President Emmanuel Macron clashed with Italy\u2019s prime minister over the specific language to include on abortion rights. The Group of Seven\u2019s summit declaration on Friday referred to \u201ccomprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all\u201d but did not include the word\u00a0\u201cabortion\u201d itself \u2013 a contrast to the group\u2019s previous communique, released after the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, which called explicitly for \u201caccess to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care.\u201d American officials said US President Joe Biden pushed to keep in language about reproductive rights after the summit host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia\u00a0Meloni, sought to strip some language from the document. Friday\u2019s communique appeared to be a diplomatic solution, with the statement endorsing the Hiroshima text without reproducing it. The document emphasizes the seven nations\u2019 \u201ccommitments in the Hiroshima Leaders\u2019 Communiqu\u00e9 to universal access to adequate,\u00a0affordable, and quality health services for women, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive\u00a0health and rights for all,\u201d the communique reads. The annual gathering\u2019s communique sets out the bloc\u2019s values and agenda for the year ahead. Several previous summits\u2019 communiques have also stopped short of using the word \u201cabortion,\u201d calling instead for access to sexual and reproductive health services. \u2018I regret it, but I respect it\u2019 Negotiations over this year\u2019s language caused a public clash on the sidelines of the summit between Meloni and Macron. Asked by an Italian journalist on Thursday how he felt about a G7 statement \u201cwithout the word abortion,\u201d Macron said he regretted Rome\u2019s position. \u201cFrance shares this vision of equality between men and women. It is not a vision that is shared by all the political spectrum. I regret it but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people,\u201d he said. France intends to \u201cdefend with force\u201d the right to abortion, he added. Meloni defended her conservative government\u2019s position on Thursday, and accused Macron of playing politics, days after he called\u00a0snap parliamentary elections\u00a0in France for later this month. \u201cThere is no reason to argue about issues on which we have already agreed for some time. I believe it is profoundly wrong, in difficult times like these, to campaign using a precious forum like the G7,\u201d Meloni told reporters Thursday. The bloc has used the past two summits primarily to stress its support for Ukraine as the country tries to repel Russia\u2019s invasion and show it remains undivided in the face of resurgent global threats. But, coming swiftly after European parliamentary elections which saw far-right parties make gains in several countries \u2013 and ahead of the United States presidential election in November \u2013 national political issues have intruded on this summit more than in previous years. Biden, who has made protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid, had pushed to ensure that an endorsement of the Hiroshima statement would be in the communique, according to US officials on Thursday. \u201cThe president felt very strongly that we need to have at the very least the language that references what we did in Hiroshima on women\u2019s health and reproductive rights,\u201d a senior US administration official said. The issue of abortion has become particularly febrile in the US since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a decision made possible by a solid six-member conservative majority, including three judges nominated by former President Donald Trump. In Italy, however, where Meloni\u2019s conservative platform helped propel her party to power in 2022, she has largely toed the G7\u2019s line on geopolitical issues \u2013 while pushing hard-right policies domestically. She has previously called abortion a \u201ctragedy,\u201d surrogacy \u201cinhuman\u201d and has removed lesbian mothers\u2019 names from their children\u2019s birth certificates. Francesco Lollobrigida, Meloni\u2019s brother-in-law, informal spokesman and Italy\u2019s agriculture minister, suggested the reason Meloni feels so strongly about this issue was because the Pope has been present at the summit. The clash between Meloni and Macron comes after France in March became the world\u2019s first country to enshrine abortion rights in its constitution, the culmination of an effort which began in direct response to the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to roll back abortion rights in America. \u201cFrance integrated this right of women to an abortion, the freedom to have control over one\u2019s body within this institution. The same sensibility is not shared in your country today,\u201d Macron said at the summit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/europe/meloni-macron-italy-france-abortion-g7-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a video statement released on Tuesday, prosecutor Karim Khan said the ICC has an active investigation into possible atrocity crimes being committed at present in Darfur. \u201cI am extremely concerned about allegations of widespread international crimes being committed in al-Fashir and its surrounding areas, as we speak,\u201d Khan said, adding that his office was investigating those allegations \u201cwith urgency\u201d.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_hamas-responds-hostage-deal-intl-latam", "text": "Talks to bring about a ceasefire and hostage deal that could stop the war in Gaza were thrown into doubt when Israel characterized a Hamas response to the latest proposal as a rejection,\u00a0precipitating a blame game between the two sides. Hamas had submitted its response to Qatari mediators, proposing amendments to the Israeli proposal, including a timeline for a permanent ceasefire and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a source with knowledge of the talks told CNN on Tuesday. A diplomatic source familiar with ongoing negotiations, however, told CNN Wednesday that Hamas has neither accepted nor rejected the deal, and that framing the Hamas response as a rejection is misleading. Speaking at a news conference in Doha on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that \u201cHamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table\u201d for a permanent ceasefire and release of the hostages. \u201cSome of the changes are workable. Some are not,\u201d he said, without providing further details. Blinken said he discussed the changes with Egyptian and Qatari partners, but stressed that the proposed deal \u201cwas virtually identical\u201d to a proposal that Hamas previously accepted. \u201cHamas could have answered with a single word \u2013 yes,\u201d he said, adding that as\u00a0Hamas proposed more changes,\u00a0he questioned whether the group is negotiating \u201cin good faith.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for the haggling to stop and a ceasefire to start. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Blinken said. Speaking alongside Blinken, Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said that both Hamas and Israel have on different occasions been \u201ccounterproductive to the efforts.\u201d The Qatari official said that as a mediator, the Gulf state wants to \u201censure that we bridge the gap between those two fundamental differences; between what Hamas wants as a permanent ceasefire, and what Israel wants as a hostage release and maybe a plan to continue the war.\u201d After submitting its response Tuesday,\u00a0Hamas spokesman and political bureau member Osama Hamdan\u00a0told Lebanon-based TV Al Mayadeen, the group was committed to achieving a ceasefire. \u201cOur response is a clear reaffirmation of our commitment to the ceasefire and withdrawal from Gaza, a commitment we have consistently upheld,\u201d Hamdan\u00a0added. But in a potential sign of how Israel views the proposed amendments, one Israeli official described Hamas\u2019 response to the original deal as a rejection. \u201cIsrael received the Hamas answer from the mediators. In its response, Hamas rejected the outline of the deal for the release of the hostages presented by US President (Joe) Biden,\u201d the official told CNN. Other news organizations report the same initial Israeli response. Hamas leadership quickly pushed back on the claim as an attempt to back out of the proposal. \u201cThe response of Hamas and the Palestinian factions to the truce proposal was responsible, serious and positive. The response is consistent with the demands of our people and the resistance and opens the way to reaching an agreement,\u201d said Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, late on Tuesday. \u201cThe Israeli media\u2019s incitement to Hamas\u2019s response is an indication of attempts to evade the agreement\u2019s obligations.\u201d\u00a0 The tensions are surfacing at a sensitive moment. Blinken\u00a0is\u00a0currently on a\u00a0diplomatic swing through the region trying to secure agreement on\u00a0the\u00a0plan first unveiled by President Biden eleven days ago. Blinken was up late into the night on Tuesday in Jordan reviewing Hamas\u2019s response to the latest Israeli proposal on the table that\u00a0his team received in-person from the\u00a0Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, a senior state department official said Wednesday. Blinken, who was in Amman as part of his multi-country trip to the Middle East, sent two senior State Department officials on Tuesday night to meet with Kamel and receive the Hamas response, the official said. Assistant Secretary Barbara Leaf and Counselor Derek Chollet, the officials who met Kamel, then came back to brief Blinken at his hotel, the official said. The official would not characterize the contents of the Hamas response. The plan being negotiated, drafted by Israel, has not been made public in full. Endorsed by the United Nations Security Council on Monday, the plan\u00a0envisages\u00a0a six-week ceasefire - during which Hamas would release hostages and Israel would release Palestinian prisoners \u2013 that would evolve into a permanent cessation of hostilities through negotiations. The White House has been at pains to stress it is an Israeli plan and have repeatedly said that Israel has accepted it, despite objections from Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mixed signals in Israel Earlier Tuesday, Israel had made its clearest signal yet that it was poised to formally sign up to the plan - though in the same short statement it suggested it intended to maintain the freedom to keep fighting. The short Israeli communication, attributed only to an Israeli government official, though widely understood to mean the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, started with an assertion of Israel\u2019s war aims before expressing support for the US-backed proposal currently on the table. \u201cIsrael will not end the war before achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future,\u201d it said. \u201cThe proposal presented enables Israel to achieve these goals and Israel will indeed do so,\u201d the statement concluded. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s oft-repeated promise of total victory and the elimination of Hamas did not get a mention. The Israeli leader is caught between the voices of many in his country, who believe a ceasefire deal is the best way to secure the release of the 120 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, and those of his extreme right coalition partners who are adamant they want the war to continue. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir have both threatened to collapse the government if Netanyahu agrees to the deal in its current form. By contrast, senior opposition figures like one-time war cabinet member Benny Gantz, and opposition leader Yair Lapid have also been among those urging Netanyahu to embrace the US-backed plan. Hamas has also been under pressure to get on board with the US-backed proposal but said last week it is concerned Israel might not go through with the second phase of the plan \u2013 a permanent end to the fighting. \u201cUnless there is a clear position [from Israel] to prepare for a permanent ceasefire and a total withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, which is what could open the door wide to completing the agreement\u2026 we cannot come to an agreement,\u201d Hamas spokesman\u00a0and political bureau member\u00a0Osama Hamdan warned last week.

{"id": "2024_06_14_sport_germany-scotland-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Host Germany kicked off Euro 2024 in spectacular fashion on Friday, hammering 10-man Scotland 5-1 in Munich to record the biggest opening match victory in European Championship history. First-half goals from Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and Kai Havertz put the result beyond doubt early on, before Niclas F\u00fcllkrug and Emre Can, who wasn\u2019t even in the squad 48 hours ago, added gloss to the score line in the second period. Antonio R\u00fcdiger\u2019s own goal in the 87th minute was nothing more than a consolation but gave the Scotland fans a moment to remember on a difficult night. The Tartan Army was dealt a double blow at the end of the first half when Ryan Porteous was shown a red card for a horrific lunge on \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan, which also resulted in a penalty and Havertz\u2019s goal. The result \u2013 but more importantly, the dominant nature of Germany\u2019s performance \u2013 will likely be a significant boost for Die Mannschaft fans, who largely didn\u2019t have high hopes for their national team at these home Euros. There will certainly be tougher tests ahead, including against Hungary and Switzerland in the group, but Germany couldn\u2019t have wished for a more straightforward \u2013 and encouraging \u2013 start. \u201cI\u2019m happy, I\u2019m satisfied,\u201d manager Julian Nagelsmann told ITV after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy the first game when you\u2019re the home country. \u201cThe first 20 minutes, we did brilliantly, good possession and counter pressing. We conceded one goal, but in the end, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Blistering start It took just 10 minutes for Germany to find a way through Scotland\u2019s defense as Wirtz\u2019s first-time finish from the edge of the area capped a sweeping team move. It was the kind of clinical finish German fans have come to expect from Wirtz after a stunning season for Bundesliga champion Bayer Leverkusen, ending the campaign with 18 goals and 20 assists in all competitions. Just eight minutes later, it was 2-0. This time, it was a piece of magic from G\u00fcndo\u011fan that unlocked Scotland\u2019s backline, turning on a dime before threading a pinpoint through ball into Havertz, who found Musiala for a thumping finish. Things then looked to have gone from bad to worse for Scotland when Germany was awarded a penalty, but the Tartan Army behind the goal was given a reprieve when the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled Ryan Christie\u2019s foul on Musiala was outside of the area. Scotland was offering next to nothing as an attacking threat and the first half was quickly beginning to resemble a training session as Germany passed the ball around with ease. Any semblance of the match being a contest was ended just before half-time when Porteous was shown a straight red card for his wild lunge on G\u00fcndo\u011fan, which also resulted in a Germany penalty that Havertz converted with nonchalance. There were a few stoic renditions of \u2018Flower of Scotland\u2019 that echoed around the Allianz Arena in the second half, but substitute F\u00fcllkrug\u2019s stunning finish into the top corner promptly silenced the Scottish enthusiasm in the stands. But Scotland did come away with a moment to remember just three minutes from time when substitute Scott McKenna headed Andy Robertson\u2019s long free kick towards goal, taking a deflection off R\u00fcdiger and nestling in the back of the net. Germany didn\u2019t allow Scotland fans much time to enjoy their moment as Can, who was a late callup following youngster Aleksandar Pavlovi\u0107\u2019s injury, found the bottom corner from the edge of the area. The thumping win will be a considerable boost to a team that didn\u2019t come into its home tournament with high expectations. Poor form and performances led to the federation sacking head coach Hansi Flick in September 2023 and bringing in Nagelsmann, who has also struggled to consistently find results. Germany has a rich history in major tournaments, winning four World Cups and three European Championships, but success recently has been harder to come by. The national team hasn\u2019t won a knockout match at a major tournament in almost eight years, getting knocked out at the group stages of the two previous World Cups and losing in the round of 16 at Euro 2020. But after Germany\u2019s performance on Friday, some fans might now be dreaming of a second \u2018Sommerm\u00e4rchen\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018summer fairytale\u2019 \u2013 a term given to the summer of 2006 when Germany unexpectedly reached the semifinals of the World Cup on home soil when expectations were similarly low. That year, it was an early Philipp Lahm goal and 4-2 win over Costa Rica that sparked an unlikely summer party. Could Wirtz\u2019s goal be the catalyst this year?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/germany-scotland-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_africa_sudan-darfur-genocide-fears-explainer-intl", "text": "Darfur, a region in western Sudan, has a tragic history marked by ethnic violence and humanitarian crises. In the early 2000s, the area experienced a brutal conflict that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Today, there are alarming signs that Darfur may be heading towards another genocide. For more than a year, swathes of Sudan have erupted in fierce clashes between the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that have left more 14,000 people dead and displaced more than 8 million others, according to the United Nations. But their battle for territorial control has now drifted toward El Fasher, the last major town in Darfur that\u2019s yet to be conquered by the RSF. Analysts say it\u2019s only a matter of days before El Fasher falls to the rebels. What\u2019s happening in Darfur? Ethnic-related killings have intensified in Darfur since fighting broke out in mid-April last year between the rival military factions. The RSF, which evolved from the Arab Janjaweed militia that spearheaded the genocide of the early 2000s, killing an estimated 300,000 people, has however, targeted the Masalit ethnic group and other non-Arab communities. Reports indicate widespread atrocities, including mass killings, sexual violence, and the systematic destruction of villages. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented these abuses, which have been likened to ethnic cleansing campaigns. The violence has forced tens of thousands of people to flee, many seeking refuge in neighboring Chad, the UN Refugee Agency said. At least 134 people were killed in El Fasher last month after gunfire rang out in the city and bombs fell on civilian homes as RSF fighters encircled the town. Last week, North Darfur\u2019s main hospital in El Fasher was also forced to close after the RSF raided the facility and looted vital supplies. The hospital had previously been hit by bullets and mortar shells. Indicators of genocide The RSF is headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, also known as Hemedti, a former leader of the Janjaweed militia. Analysts told CNN that the targeted nature of the violence in Darfur, the systematic approach of the RSF, and the historical context of ethnic conflicts in the region all suggest that the situation could evolve into another genocide. The intent to destroy the Masalit people and other non-Arab groups mirrors the patterns of violence that characterized the genocide of the early 2000s, said Sudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali. \u201cThe RSF uses systematic dehumanization method against non-Arabs in Darfur, saying,\u00a0\u2018these are dirt, dogs and monkeys\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s kill the babies and males because if they grow up, they will fight us back.\u2019 There is a systematic policy of dehumanization .. the same explicit incitement from since the early 2000s,\u201d said Ali, a legal adviser at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. In April, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, warned that \u201cprevailing signs of genocide\u201d and \u201cgrave human rights violations and abuses continue to be reported against innocent civilian populations\u201d in Sudan. \u201cMost of the atrocities that are committed today\u00a0are by the same actors in the early 2000s.\u00a0The RSF is rebranded Janjaweed militia: same commanders, same ethnic tribes, and the same victim groups (non-Arab communities) in Darfur\u00a0that are being systematically targeted by the RSF,\u201d Ali told CNN. He added: \u201cWe see that the perpetrators are documenting their abuses by themselves. Back in the day, there were no cell\u00a0phones,\u00a0and (abuses) were primarily documented by human rights organizations that were in Sudan.\u00a0But this time, they document killing people, burning villages, and their incitement.\u201d Weapons support from regional powers Ali says that technology and sophisticated weaponry are the only peculiarities that differentiate the RSF\u2019s current atrocities from the genocide committed by the Janjaweed more than two decades ago. Where previously, they used camels, horses, and basic weapons. The militia now has armored vehicles, drones, and advanced weaponry, along with significant support from regional powers and nations such as the United Arab Emirates, Ali said. A June 12 report by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab said that a cargo plane believed to be owned by the UAE was identified through satellite imagery flying within RSF-controlled areas in El-Fasher on June 11. \u201cThe same model of aircraft (IL-76) is reported to be used for lethal aid transfers by the UAE to the RSF for flights to locations in Chad,\u201d the report added. The UAE has denied providing military, financial, or logistical support to any armed group in Sudan. What happens if El Fasher falls? US Special Envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, said this week that El Fasher\u2019s fall to the RSF could be imminent. Home to nearly 2 million people, the city is predominantly occupied by non-Arab\u00a0ethnic groups, including the Masalit. El Fasher also shelters hundreds of thousands of displaced people who fled other parts of Darfur that were captured by the RSF, including El Geneina where hundreds of non-Arab people were massacred last year. Ali told CNN similar atrocities were likely to happen in El Fasher if the city came under RSF control. \u201cEl Fasher is going to be a lot more catastrophic because it is basically in the middle of a desert. Even if people decide to leave, probably they will die\u00a0in the desert. We will see another genocide on our watch.\u201d What has been the international response? The UN Security Council adopted a UK-led\u00a0resolution Thursday demanding that the RSF ends its \u201csiege\u201d of El Fasher. \u201cThe fighting must stop now,\u201d said UK Foreign Secretary\u00a0David Cameron in a post on X, adding that warring \u201cparties must let in urgent humanitarian aid to prevent a famine.\u201d Earlier this week, the International Criminal Court said it was investigating allegations of war crimes in El Fasher while making a public call for evidence. International response to the conflict has however been criticized as insufficient. Despite calls for action, including the deployment of protective missions and the imposition of sanctions by the United States on key RSF commanders, concrete measures have been limited. \u201cThe international response does not come close to meeting the scale of the world\u2019s largest man-made humanitarian disaster,\u201d said\u00a0international human rights lawyer, Yonah Diamond. \u201cThe major powers have largely invested in a sham peace process for 14 months that is going nowhere and serves as a cover for daily mass atrocities on the ground. Only concrete acts of protection and accountability will stem the violence,\u201d he told CNN. International efforts to broker ceasefires between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF have been unsuccessful. Diamond said there has also been insufficient coverage of the Sudan war when compared to other global conflicts. \u201cEvery major news outlet has dedicated an ongoing slot to Gaza and Ukraine, with ad hoc coverage for Sudan. There is no reason why a conflict impacting a greater number of civilians, threatening millions with death by starvation and an ongoing genocide do not receive the same attention,\u201d he said. He noted that this lack of attention hinders humanitarian efforts, pointing out that while Gaza and Ukraine have each received about 30% of their humanitarian response plans, Sudan, where 25 million people urgently need help, has received only about half of that amount. What will happen next? As Sudan steers dangerously towards another genocide, the world\u2019s response in the coming months will be crucial in determining the outcome. \u201cThe international community, led by the African Union, must deploy a civilian protection mechanism to protect the millions at risk in El Fasher and elsewhere in Sudan and explicitly threaten the UAE with consequences should it fail to restrain the RSF and continue to supply the militias with heavy weaponry,\u201d Diamond advised. \u201cThe US, the UK, and others have leverage to exert pressure on their ally, the UAE, to end the RSF\u2019s genocidal campaign today. President (Joe) Biden can simply call on the UAE to halt its support for the RSF, which would fall apart without it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/africa/sudan-darfur-genocide-fears-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_sport_scottie-scheffler-ludvig-aberg-us-open-spt-intl", "text": "Many have waxed lyrical about the might of Pinehurst No. 2 across its 117-year history, but on Friday the North Carolina course received perhaps its greatest appraisal yet: it made Scottie Scheffler look human. After exercising a vice-like grip over the golfing realm with an impassive coolness for months on end, the world No. 1\u2019s unflappable brilliance finally buckled during the second round of the 124th US Open on Friday. Scheffler\u2019s run of 168 rounds with at least one birdie went skidding off the sides of Pinehurst\u2019s fiendishly firm and fast greens as he toiled to a four-over par 74, compounding an opening 71. \u201cYesterday I felt like I did a great job. Today I just couldn\u2019t get the putts to fall,\u201d Scheffler told reporters after his round. \u201cThis golf course can be unpredictable at times, and maybe it got the better of me the last couple days. I\u2019ll sit down and think about where we\u2019re going the last few days and figure it out.\u201d How damaging those two days were to Scheffler\u2019s hopes of a sixth win in nine starts was merely a secondary consideration: at five-over overall, the overwhelming tournament favorite arrived at the clubhouse admitting he did not expect to return for the final 36 holes. By the skin of his teeth, Scheffler avoided missing the weekend at a major for the first time since 2022 as another day of high scoring saw the cut line fall at five-over par, edging through the 27-year-old and a host of other relieved stars. \u2018Maybe the worst golf shot I think I\u2019ve ever seen you hit\u2019 It made for an anxious wait after a morning that brimmed with frustration for the typically unflustered Texan. Having started from the 10th tee, Scheffler tossed his putter into the air in exasperation after his par-saving effort at the 15th hole curled away at the death, resigning him to a first bogey of the day. When his opening drive at the 17th veered left, Scheffler muttered to himself in the second person: \u201cMaybe the worst golf shot I think I\u2019ve ever seen you hit.\u201d After a repeat outcome at the subsequent tee box, he slammed his driver on the ground before picking up his tee and throwing it. Despite those errors, the reigning Masters champion generally drove well throughout but struggled on and around the greens, his woes peaking during a disastrous double bogey at the par-five fifth hole. His third shot was an attempted chip onto the green from the native area that gained him mere inches, as his ball caught a slope and rolled back to his feet. Scheffler\u2019s subsequent effort left him even further away from the hole, skipping past the flag and over the other side of the green. There were still a few grains of salt left to rub into the wound, as Scheffler\u2019s putt to escape with a bogey came up four inches short. Incredibly, playing partner and last month\u2019s PGA Championship victor Xander Schauffele endured an almost identical series of unfortunate events for a double bogey of his own, his ball rolling back to him before skidding well past the cup on the next attempt. The world No. 2 put his own frustrations into words candidly after returning to the clubhouse. \u201cThat pissed me off,\u201d Schauffele, who shot one-under 69 to climb into a share of ninth at one-under overall, told reporters. Aberg nudges ahead Though Schauffele remains within striking distance, Scheffler finds himself 10 shots behind Sweden\u2019s Ludvig Aberg, who tops the leaderboard by a stroke at five-under par overall after shooting 69. The 24-year-old has enjoyed a meteoric rise and continues to impress in his first ever US Open appearance and just his third career major outing, having finished second on his Masters debut in April. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019m thinking about all the time, but sometimes I have to stop for a little bit and think about how fortunate I am to be able to do this at this level,\u201d world No. 6 Aberg told reporters. \u201cTo be able to play these tournaments, to be able to play with the guys that I\u2019ve watched on TV for such a long time is definitely a pinch-me moment.\u201d Belgium\u2019s Thomas Detry, as well as American duo Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Cantlay, lead the chasing pack, with Rory McIlroy \u2013 bidding to end a 10-year wait for his fifth major crown \u2013 a stroke behind the trio. Woods uncertain on open future A host of big names fell foul of the cut line, including two of the world\u2019s top-10. Viktor Hovland and Max Homa narrowly missed out at six-under overall, while three-time champion Tiger Woods finished one shot behind the duo. Woods had been competing on a special exemption after failing to qualify for a major for the first time in his professional career, but the 48-year-old showed flashes of his old brilliance as he shot 74 and 73. The 15-time major champion made it to the weekend at the Masters in April but has now missed the cut at successive majors after falling away at the PGA Championship last month. He is eligible to play at next month\u2019s Open Championship in Scotland due to his status as a previous winner yet when asked by CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell if he might have played his last US Open, Woods cast doubt on his future at both open tournaments. \u201cAs far as my last Open Championship or US Open Championship, I don\u2019t know what that is. It may or may not be,\u201d Woods told Snell. \u201cMy ball-striking and felt like my putting was good enough to be in contention and I\u2019m not,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because I\u2019m not here to have a chance to win on the weekend.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/scottie-scheffler-ludvig-aberg-us-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba", "text": "In twelve years of living in Cuba, I have waited in all kinds of lines. Lines to buy food, lines to pay bills, lines just because people were lining up for something maybe worth lining up for. But now I was in a line for something unexpected:\u00a0to\u00a0board\u00a0a Russian warship docked in Havana\u2019s harbor. When a Russian diplomat told me that starting on Thursday, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate would offer tours to the public for three days, I was somewhat skeptical. The Gorshkov is one of the most modern vessels in the Russian fleet, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. I had trouble imagining that\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin\u2019s prized\u00a0ship would be opened for anyone to see. When the Gorshkov arrived in Cuba\u00a0on Wednesday, it fired a deafening\u00a021-shot\u00a0salute.\u00a0The\u00a0Cubans answered with cannon fire from an 18th\u00a0century fortress overlooking the harbor that the Spanish had built to protect the city from pirates. With the frigate came a rescue tug, a fuel ship and the Kazan, an imposing nuclear-powered submarine. Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Defense said that none of the ships were carrying nuclear weapons and that they did not represent \u201ca threat to the region,\u201d clearly meaning the US, Cuba\u2019s neighbor 90 miles to the\u00a0north. But for many Cubans, the visit of the largest convoy of ships in years from their old Cold War ally seemed like a return to the past, particularly as Moscow and Washington increasingly spar over the war in Ukraine. \u201cI never thought I would see a Russian submarine so up close,\u201d said a Cuban man next to me as we waited in line in view of the four\u00a0vessels. We were standing outside the port terminal in Havana which,\u00a0just years earlier,\u00a0had been full\u00a0of\u00a0US cruise ships, until then-President Donald Trump banned their visits to the island\u00a0in 2019. Even though a line had formed, it was not clear if any of us waiting there were going to get aboard. An hour passed in the broiling Cuban sun. \u201cWe are roasting out here,\u201d a woman carrying a small baby next to me said. Cubans are champion line-waiters and I worried that I would have nothing to show for my interlude outside the port other than a worsening sunburn. Finally, a Cuban Navy official in a sparkling white uniform came out to speak to us, resting his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou can go aboard but need to leave any sharp objects like knives, scissors or hair clippers behind,\u201d he said. Two plainclothes\u00a0state\u00a0security officers began to run everyone\u2019s\u00a0identity card numbers through a database on their phones. I handed my\u00a0carn\u00e9,\u00a0or\u00a0ID card,\u00a0that lists my birthplace in the US to one of the officers who appeared too young to shave. He looked at my\u00a0carn\u00e9\u00a0and turned to his older colleague for advice. \u201cAre we letting foreign residents on board?\u201d\u00a0he asked. The older officer,\u00a0who was wearing a New York Yankee\u2019s baseball cap,\u00a0nodded and then ran my card information through the database. \u201cYou can go ahead,\u201d he said. Inside the port, past officials manning a metal detector, Russian sailors in dark blue unforms waited to take a group of about\u00a020\u00a0of us aboard the Gorshkov. In front of the ship, the sailors had posted a sign in English that declared the Gorshkov\u2019s \u201cmain purpose\u201d was \u201ccombat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines.\u201d The Russian sailors spoke more English than Spanish and I occasionally translated to help the other members of our group, who were\u00a0all\u00a0Cuban. We were told we could film and everyone immediately took out their smartphones to snap videos and selfies. We started out on the ship\u2019s massive helicopter pad and then walked through the ship to the bow. Every few feet a Russian sailor stood keeping watch. At the front of the ship, one of the sailors\u00a0showed me an anti-rocket system\u00a0to be used\u00a0in the unlikely event we came under attack. I asked about the massive cannon and the sailor replied that it could fire shells a distance of 23 kilometers,\u00a0or about 15 miles. A level up, where there appeared to be sensitive communications equipment, a Russian soldier in tactical gear with an assault rifle at his side looked down at us. Just off the bow we could see an unobstructed view of the Kazan, the 430-foot long submarine that stretched out into the harbor. I noticed one of the Russian sailors taking in the blue skies and calm waters around us. \u201cCuba good?\u201d I ask him. \u201cCuba good,\u201d he laughs in reply and gives me a thumbs up. The war in Ukraine has\u00a0severely\u00a0degraded the Russian fleet and once again pitted the US and Russia on opposite sides of a bloody conflict. For a Russian sailor, Cuba could be as good as it gets these days. I disembarked the Russian warship in Havana feeling that the Cold War did not seem like such a distant memory, when I saw an alert flash across my phone. It was an announcement that the Pentagon had just dispatched its own nuclear powered attack submarine\u00a0to the other side of the island:\u00a0the US Navy Base in Guantanamo\u00a0Bay,\u00a0Cuba, slightly more than 500 miles away from the where the Russian ships are docked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_stood-up-met-love-of-life-chance-encounters", "text": "When the guy she\u2019d met on the plane asked her out, Cristina Farina said yes without hesitation. Cristina had spent much of the flight to London from her Italian hometown Florence deep in conversation with this stranger. He seemed friendly, interesting, interested. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we meet tomorrow, go have a coffee, spend some time together?\u201d he suggested. \u201cLet\u2019s meet at 11 on Trafalgar Square.\u201d Upon landing at Heathrow Airport, Cristina and her plane crush went their separate ways, vowing to meet the next day. It was August 26, 1984. They didn\u2019t swap addresses or contact numbers. Texting wasn\u2019t an option. They just had to hope they\u2019d both keep their promise and be there the following day. Cristina grabbed her bag from the luggage carousel and headed into central London, feeling invigorated and excited. She was 18 years old, set to spend three months in the UK studying English. It was Cristina\u2019s first significant period away from home. Possibility stretched out before her. \u201cI loved London,\u201d Cristina tells CNN Travel today. \u201cIt gave me a lot of energy. I felt free to do what I wanted.\u201d The next day, shortly before 11 a.m., Cristina climbed the steps out of Charing Cross tube station and arrived in Trafalgar Square \u2013 an open, pedestrianized spot home to fountains, the UK\u2019s National Gallery and the imposing Nelson\u2019s Column, guarded by four large bronze lions. Trafalgar Square\u2019s almost always busy, and that day in 1984 was no different. Crowds of tourists dodged low flying pigeons as they lined up for entry to the gallery. Outside the South African embassy, protestors were opposing apartheid. It was sunny, with a warm breeze, and there were plenty of sunbathers sitting on the gallery steps and dotted around the square. Cristina searched for her airplane date among the throngs of people. There was no sign of him, but she was a bit early. Time ticked on. He was still nowhere to be seen. \u201cThe guy never showed up,\u201d says Cristina today. Getting stood up wasn\u2019t exactly how Cristina had imagined beginning her London adventure. She was a bit disheartened. She had no way of contacting her plane crush. But while waiting for him to show, she\u2019d had plenty of time to scan the other people in Trafalgar Square that day. And one person in particular had caught her eye. \u201cI saw this guy sitting in between the lions,\u201d Cristina recalls. \u201cHe caught my attention because he was good looking \u2013 long hair, kind of a hippyish look.\u201d He was leaning on the plinth between the bronze lions, reading a book. As Cristina got closer, she saw it was a copy of William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The guy was also listening to a walkman. As Cristina approached, he took off his headphones, looked up and smiled. \u201cHi,\u201d Cristina said. \u201cHi,\u201d he replied. Feeling bold, Cristina sat down next to the stranger. He looked a little surprised, but he put down his book and smiled at her again. \u201cThen we just started talking,\u201d says Cristina today. Two days in London The guy leaning on the Trafalgar Square lions was 20-year-old Matt Reinecke, an American college student on vacation with his family, visiting from California. It turned out Matt had spotted Cristina before she approached him. \u201cWhy does this pretty girl keep looking at me?\u201d he thought. Then, when Cristina spoke to him, then sat down next to him, Matt was thrilled. \u201cI was traveling, and I knew that I was leaving in two days. And then a cute girl sat down next to me \u2013 that was enough for me,\u201d he tells CNN Travel today. Matt and Cristina introduced themselves, and Cristina gestured to Matt\u2019s walkman, asking what he\u2019d been listening to. Matt explained he was a huge fan of the Grateful Dead \u2013 he\u2019d been to several of their tour dates in the US. Then, Matt asked Cristina what brought her to London, and she spoke about her excitement about her upcoming three months away from home. There was a bit of a language barrier \u2013 Cristina couldn\u2019t always understand Matt\u2019s Americanisms \u2013 she was more used to British English. But the connection between them was palpable right away. \u201cI liked him immediately,\u201d says Cristina. For the next two hours, Matt and Cristina sat, side by side, in Trafalgar Square, talking. At some point, Matt got out his camera and took a photo of Cristina, leaning against the monument, looking at him. Eventually, Matt had to leave to meet his parents. \u201cBut what are you doing later today?\u201d he asked Cristina. \u201cWant to meet for a drink?\u201d Matt and Cristina made plans to meet a few hours later. Matt\u2019s family was staying at Claridge\u2019s, the historic, swanky five star hotel in Mayfair. He told Cristina he\u2019d meet her outside Bond Street Station. Unlike Cristina\u2019s would-be airplane date, Matt showed up. Matt\u2019s parents knew he was going on a spontaneous date. They were also having a drink at a different spot on Bond Street, and asked Matt if he\u2019d walk by with Cristina, so they could take a peek and wave hello. Matt and Cristina obliged, giggling as they walked by and saw Matt\u2019s parents\u2019 curious but friendly faces. Then, sitting in a pub together, Matt and Cristina picked up where they\u2019d left off. They shared their first kiss. Cristina left the pub in a daze. She and Matt had made plans to meet again. He only had one more day left in London, but wanted to spend it with Cristina. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d Cristina recalls. \u201cI was really looking forward to seeing him the next day.\u201d The next day, the sun was also shining. Cristina and Matt headed to Hyde Park. \u201cWe really just kissed and talked all day in the park,\u201d recalls Matt. This time, Cristina took a photo of Matt, on her camera. In the picture he\u2019s smiling, looking away from the camera, wearing his Grateful Dead t-shirt. Matt\u2019s flight wasn\u2019t until the evening, so he put off leaving for as long as possible. When he finally said goodbye, Matt passed Cristina a note. \u201cDon\u2019t open it until you get home,\u201d he told her. Cristina obliged. She was staying with a host family organized by the language school. She waited until she got back to her room and unfurled the paper. \u201cThe note said, \u2018I can\u2019t bear the thought of never seeing you again,\u2019\u201d recalls Cristina today. She remembers welling up. \u201cI knew I was going to see him again. And I knew I was going to spend time with him somewhere, somehow.\u201d Lost letters Despite that feeling of certainty, Cristina still felt heartbroken. And she felt lonely. She wished her girlfriends from Italy were close by so she could talk through her emotions. Instead, dug out some paper from her bag and wrote a long letter to her best friend back home, telling her about Matt, about their whirlwind romance. \u201cI was completely wrapped up in these two days I spent with him,\u201d says Cristina. The next day, the woman Cristina was staying with noticed her bloodshot eyes and asked Cristina what was wrong. In the absence of anyone else to speak to, Cristina confided in her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll see him again,\u201d said Cristina\u2019s host. \u201cDo you have his address?\u201d Cristina did have \u2013 scrawled on a piece of paper \u2013 Matt\u2019s college address. He was still traveling around Europe with his parents, and wouldn\u2019t be back there for a while. But Cristina wrote him a letter anyway. And while she didn\u2019t receive a reply right away, Cristina settled into her London life. The feeling of heartbreak faded a little, and she made friends. \u201cI had a wonderful time,\u201d she recalls. Matt was still in the back of her mind. Weeks passed, and she didn\u2019t hear from him. She sent another letter. Still nothing. Surely he was back at school by now? Maybe she had the wrong address? \u201cSo I tried to find out his parents\u2019 address instead,\u201d recalls Cristina. \u201cI knew they\u2019d been staying at Claridge\u2019s, so I contacted Claridge\u2019s, asking for the address. Of course, they couldn\u2019t give me the address of the parents. But they told me, \u2018Send the letter to us, and we\u2019ll forward it to them.\u2019 So that\u2019s what happened.\u201d It turned out Matt hadn\u2019t received Cristina\u2019s first letters. \u201cI was a university student, so I was changing apartments every year,\u201d he explains today. \u201cAnd then they would never forward the mail.\u201d Cristina\u2019s idea of writing to Matt\u2019s parents\u2019 address was a good one. \u201cFinally, he got all my letters,\u201d says Cristina. And eventually, when Cristina was back in Italy, Matt\u2019s reply arrived: \u201cFour pages folded into one small envelope that had me very emotional and excited,\u201d as Cristina recalls. \u201cI locked myself in my room and read it slowly over and over again.\u201d Even with correct addresses established, Cristina remained the driving force behind their keeping in touch. It wasn\u2019t that Matt wasn\u2019t interested \u2013 he thought about Cristina often, daydreaming about those magical two days in London. But letter writing didn\u2019t come naturally to him in the same way it did her. Still, over the next two years, Cristina and Matt kept up a epistolery correspondence. A couple of times, they spoke on the phone but \u201cvery rarely,\u201d because of the steep transatlantic phone costs. And even as months, then years passed without them seeing one another, Cristina and Matt believed they would one day reunite, just as Matt promised in the note he\u2019d given Cristina when he left London. \u201cI knew I was going to come back,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI had the certainty that I was going to see him again,\u201d says Cristina. As time went on, their letters became more detailed. Matt would send Cristina his sociology college essays and Cristina loved this, getting to see how Matt\u2019s brain worked, getting a glimpse into his political views, his perspective on the world. And while Cristina\u2019s early letters were \u201cmainly about my daily life, my friends, my family, my travels,\u201d as time went on, she \u201cwrote about my feelings, my dreams.\u201d \u201cThe letters became more important as our relationship grew, as we got to know each other over time,\u201d says Matt. Reuniting in Florence 1986 rolled around. In a letter, Matt told Cristina he was planning to visit Europe that summer. His goal was to get to Greece, but \u2013 if it was okay with Cristina and her family \u2013 he\u2019d plan a stop off in Florence, where Cristina lived with her parents. \u201cI was super excited,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cA bit nervous because he had to meet my family, but overall I was the happiest girl on Earth.\u201d Cristina\u2019s parents knew about her London romance. They saw the way she reacted to the arrival of Matt\u2019s letters. They were still a little skeptical about the whole thing. And when Matt arrived at their home \u2013 in clothes crumpled from traveling and with long hair \u2013 they were even more skeptical. \u201cBut eventually they started to like him,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cHe was a good influence in my family \u2013 he was fun, he made people laugh. He didn\u2019t speak a word of Italian. But he started to speak slowly, by learning slowly, by listening to my parents and my brother, who was a couple years younger than I was.\u201d In the end, Matt never made it to Greece. Instead, he spent three months with Cristina in Italy. Matt says their reunion was an exciting, romantic \u201cblur.\u201d \u201cIt was a dream,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cIt was a movie type of thing.\u201d At the end of the summer, Matt returned to the US to finish college. Later that year, Cristina visited him in California. In summer 1987, Matt graduated college and headed straight to Italy to see Cristina. He got a job as an English teacher in Florence, found an apartment in the city and ended up living there for the next 18 months. After years of long distance, Matt and Cristina were finally in the same country. They weren\u2019t just pen pals, they were finally dating. \u201cThat\u2019s when we decided, we\u2019re going to live together forever,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI was still only 21, I was very young,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cBut I was very convinced that he was for me.\u201d Still, the future was still a bit uncertain. Matt felt like his teaching job was more of a stop gap than a permanent career. And Cristina had loved California when she\u2019d visited Matt the year before. Living there became a goal for them both. So Matt returned to the US in early 1989 and went back to college, getting another degree in sociology and economics. And in 1990, Cristina followed him to California. A California chapter Cristina\u2019s parents had grown to love Matt, but they were a bit worried about their daughter relocating across the world. \u201cBut they understood that it was time to try and see if things would work out,\u201d says Cristina. Meanwhile, Matt\u2019s parents were supportive, but they were from wealthy Californian society, and Matt reckons they\u2019d always imagined him meeting a girl at a San Francisco debutante ball. \u201cMy parents were more wanting me to be a part of upper class San Francisco life, and not running off to Italy,\u201d says Matt. \u201cWe were from different backgrounds,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cMy family was a normal middle class Italian family.\u201d Despite their differences, Matt and Cristina\u2019s time together in California felt like a turning point. They got their own apartment and for the first time, it felt like they were \u201cfree of outside, external things like parents, family, different things.\u201d They could be \u201cjust Matt and Cristina as a couple,\u201d as Matt puts it. Matt worked long hours at an investment bank, but even though his job was full-on, the couple made the most of their time together. Their apartment was always full of friends. They went out in San Francisco regularly. They grew closer and more sure of their future together. \u201cThe relationship had already been building, but really it just blossomed in San Francisco,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt was a wonderful time of our lives, you\u2019re in your mid to late 20s, we\u2019re living on Union Street, one of the most beautiful neighborhoods of San Francisco. We had so many friends.\u201d Matt and Cristina were committed to a future together, but the decision to get married came about rather suddenly. In 1991, Cristina received a letter from US immigration giving her two weeks to leave the country. And so on April 12, 1991 Matt and Cristina got married in San Francisco\u2019s City Hall with only Matt\u2019s mother and a few friends present. But they planned a big wedding celebration for later that year in Italy, at the 13th century Sant\u2019Angostino Church in Prato, Tuscany. \u201cOur wedding day was a lot of fun,\u201d recalls Cristina. The service was entirely in Italian. By then, Matt was pretty proficient in the language, but some of his relatives were a bit confused. Despite the language barrier, they couldn\u2019t fail to interpret the happiness on Matt and Cristina\u2019s faces, and the joy that emanated through the day. \u201cIt was a beautiful wedding,\u201d says Matt. New adventures In the summer of 1993, Matt and Cristina embarked on a new adventure together. They quit their jobs in the US and spent half a year traveling \u2013 visiting Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. Then, at the end of that traveling period, the couple left California behind and moved to Italy. \u201cWe decided to try to move back to Europe, to see if Italy works for us,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cWe said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s do it,\u2019 without thinking too much.\u201d In Italy, Matt and Cristina settled first in Milan, where they welcomed their first child, Davide, in 1997. Later, Matt\u2019s investment banking work later took them to Turin, where their daughter Francesca was born in 2003. In the mid-noughties, Matt and Cristina moved to Tuscany. They liked the idea of being closer to Cristina\u2019s parents. And after decades spent living in big cities, the Tuscan countryside was a welcome change of pace. The couple bought a run down 1600s farmhouse and focused on restructuring the house and making it into a family home. They were also kept busy by work. From 2008 until 2019, Matt and Cristina ran an American bakery in Florence, called Mama\u2019s Bakery. \u201cI think I\u2019ve made somewhere between 400,000 to 500,000 bagels,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI was the bagel king of Italy for a while.\u201d Running the business together was hard work, but rewarding. \u201cWe were a good team, we complemented each other,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt is really difficult on family time, but we often had fun together at work. I am happy we had the experience, but I am happier that we sold the business.\u201d Life today Matt and Cristina left Mama\u2019s Bakery behind in 2019. Now, they\u2019re retired, and their focus is on traveling, spending time with their kids and enjoying their home in Tuscany. \u201cWe do exactly what we want to do,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate we can do that,\u201d says Matt. After years of working and living in Italy, Matt\u2019s fluent in Italian. Matt and Cristina\u2019s children are bilingual. \u201cOur conversation in the house switches back and forth between English and Italian mid-sentence,\u201d says Matt. \u201cWho would have ever thought that I\u2019d live half my life in Italy? It\u2019s weird how just a brief second can change things in a wonderful way.\u201d For Matt and Cristina, it\u2019s surreal but special to reflect on their first meeting in Trafalgar Square, 40 years ago this year. They\u2019ve since returned to London with their kids, taking them to the spot by the lions where they first started talking. \u201cI was emotional when we were there together,\u201d says Cristina. It was a random meeting, spurred on by another random meeting \u2013 who knows what would have happened if Cristina\u2019s original airplane date had turned up that day. Although Cristina and Matt think fate played a role, looking back they\u2019re also proud that they worked to stay in touch, Cristina\u2019s proud of her spontaneity and determination, and Matt\u2019s proud of his willingness to take risks. \u201cLife is amazing,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt is crazy just how absurd things can be. Be careful out there. You might find happiness in the strangest of places if you look at it right.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stood-up-met-love-of-life-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_middleeast_un-report-israel-hamas-gaza-war-crimes-intl-hnk", "text": "A United Nations inquiry into the first few months of the war in Gaza has found both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes and grave violations of international law, in the body\u2019s first in-depth investigation into the October 7 attacks and the ensuing conflict. The damning reports released Wednesday, which cover events up to the end of 2023,\u00a0paint an alarming picture of both sides routinely disregarding international law in a devastating conflict that has now raged for more than eight months, bitterly dividing global opinion and sending tensions soaring across the Middle East. The findings were strongly disputed by Israel. The United Nations Commission of Inquiry\u2019s reports begin on October 7, the day Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups launched a murder and kidnapping spree in southern Israel which\u00a0killed more than\u00a01,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw some 250 people taken hostage. War crimes cited by the commission that day included intentionally directing attacks against civilians,\u00a0murder or willful killing, torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and taking hostages, including children. The massacres that day prompted Israel\u00a0to declare war on Hamas and launch an assault on Gaza that has destroyed much of the heavily populated enclave and killed more than 37,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities. In the first 2.5 months of the conflict, the commission found, Israel committed war crimes as well as crimes against humanity \u2013 the latter defined as a widespread, systemic attack directed at a civilian population. Israel\u2019s alleged war crimes include starvation, arbitrary detention, and killing and maiming \u201ctens of thousands of children.\u201d Both Israel and Hamas committed sexual violence and torture, and intentionally attacked civilians, according to the reports, which span more than 200 pages. The commission said its findings were based on interviews with victims and witnesses, thousands of open-source items verified through forensic analysis, hundreds of submissions, satellite imagery, forensic medical reports and media coverage, including several key CNN investigations. Israel previously announced its refusal to cooperate with the inquiry. CNN is reaching out Hamas for comment. In response to the report, Israel accused the fact-finding mission of \u201cattempting to justify\u201d Hamas\u2019 actions, of showing \u201csystematic anti-Israeli discrimination,\u201d and contextualizing the attacks \u201cthrough the lens of the Palestinian narrative.\u201d Israel\u2019s mission to the UN said Wednesday that the report did not mention continuous rocket fire on the country and claimed that it \u201coutrageously and repugnantly attempts to draw a false equivalence between IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers and Hamas terrorists with regards to acts of sexual violence,\u201d adding that the Israeli military conducts itself in accordance to international law, including international humanitarian law. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States continues \u201cto do the work to make our own assessments\u201d on whether there have been violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the war in Gaza. Speaking at a news conference in Doha, the top US diplomat said he had not seen the new UN findings, but said that \u201cof course we\u2019ll look at that.\u201d The reports released Wednesday add to previous allegations made against Israel by other major international bodies. The International Criminal Court announced last month it was seeking arrest warrants for several top Hamas and Israeli leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. At the time, both Hamas and Israel decried the charges \u2013 with Hamas describing it as an attempt to \u201cequate victims with aggressors,\u201d and Netanyahu calling it a \u201cpolitical outrage.\u201d And in February, the Israeli military denied accusations by UN experts of human rights violations against Palestinian girls and women in Gaza and the West Bank \u2013 calling the claims \u201cdespicable and unfounded.\u201d October 7 attacks The report examined Hamas\u2019 actions during the October 7 attacks, which it described as\u00a0\u201cunprecedented in scale in (Israel\u2019s) modern history\u2026 invoking painful trauma of past persecution not only for Israeli Jews but for Jewish people everywhere.\u201d Hamas militants abducted hostages \u201cwithout regard for age or gender,\u201d with some shot at, killed, and paraded around, the report said. In particular, they targeted women, whose bodies were \u201cused as victory trophies by male perpetrators\u2026 (and) put on public display, either on the streets of the Gaza Strip or online,\u201d it found. The commission said it had \u201cdocumented evidence of sexual violence\u201d carried out by Palestinian armed groups in several locations in southern Israel on October 7. The commission had also reviewed rape testimonies collected by journalists and Israeli police but said it was unable to independently verify these due to lack of access to the victims or crime sites, and because Israel obstructed its investigations. The report authors singled out the toll on Israeli children \u2013 many of whom witnessed the murders of their parents and siblings, and were targeted for abduction. Israeli forces inflicting \u2018maximum damage\u2019 In Israel\u2019s subsequent attack on Hamas, the commission wrote, its forces aimed to inflict \u201cmaximum damage\u201d without taking enough precautions \u2013 which led to a staggering death toll in Gaza, devastating injuries, and destruction of civilian infrastructure. \u201cThe deliberate use of heavy weaponry by Israeli security forces with large destructive capabilities in densely populated areas constitutes an intentional and direct attack on the civilian population, particularly affecting women and children,\u201d the commission said. It also referenced CNN reporting that found that\u00a0nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions\u00a0Israel used in Gaza were unguided, meaning they\u00a0were less precise and posed a greater threat to civilians in the densely populated strip. Asked for comment at the time, IDF spokesperson Nir Dinar told CNN: \u201cWe do not address the type of munitions used.\u201d The UN\u2019s report cited two other CNN investigations that showed Israeli forces intentionally killing civilians who posed no threat, often along evacuation routes and in designated safe areas. The siege of Gaza represents a \u201ccollective punishment against the civilian population,\u201d according to the\u00a0UN report \u2013 which accused Israel of withholding critical goods like water, food, electricity, fuel and humanitarian aid for \u201cstrategic and political gains.\u201d Sexual violence and inflammatory rhetoric The report detailed allegations of Israeli forces carrying out sexual violence in both Gaza and the Israel-occupied West Bank \u2013 intended to drive home \u201cthe subordination of an occupied people.\u201d Victims were allegedly interrogated or abused while naked or partially dressed, blindfolded, and made to kneel or keep their hands tied behind their backs, the report found. Many were forced to strip in public and walk while being sexually harassed, with their family members forced to watch. While both men and women were victims of sexual violence, men and boys were targeted in particular. The report also highlighted the inflammatory rhetoric used by senior Israeli officials, including the president and prime minister, which the UN commission said amounted to incitement and \u201cmay constitute other serious international crimes.\u201d Some Israeli officials had called for \u201cviolence and the killing of Palestinians, the erasure of the Gaza Strip, vengeance, collective punishment, noting that there are no innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, planning for new Israeli settlements on the rubble of the Gaza Strip and calling for the removal of Palestinians from Gaza to third states,\u201d the report said, without attributing to specific officials. Some of the most extreme statements in Israel\u2019s deeply divided cabinet have come from far-right members like National Security Minister Itamar\u00a0Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. They are often condemned by other cabinet members like Benny Gantz, who resigned on Sunday, and\u00a0Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. UN-Israel tensions The commission, which was set up by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 after an 11-day conflict that killed more than 200 people in both Israel and Gaza, said Israel had obstructed its access to both Israel and Palestinian territories during the investigation. It said Israeli officials had barred medical professionals and other personnel from speaking to investigators, and did not respond to any UN requests for information. The commission also requested information from the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, it said. The Palestinian Authority provided \u201cextensive comments\u201d and indicated they would welcome a visit by the UN, the commission said. Hamas, a rival to the Palestinian Authority, governs Gaza and it was not clear from the report whether the authors had also contacted the militant group. In December, Israeli Ambassador to the UN\u00a0Gilad Erdan accused the UN\u2019s Human Rights Council of being \u201cmorally distorted\u201d and antisemitic. Erdan called its investigation \u201c100% biased against Israel,\u201d and said Israel would not cooperate. The UN and Israel\u2019s long-strained relations have sunk to a historic low in recent months, with senior UN officials highly critical of Israel\u2019s war conduct in Gaza. The UN Security Council \u2013 which Israel is not part of \u2013 tried for months after October 7 to pass a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. The US, Israel\u2019s closest ally and its main weapons supplier, consistently used its veto power to block such a move \u2013 until it finally abstained in March, allowing the resolution to pass, which was immediately lambasted by Israel. And last month, a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly showed\u00a0overwhelming international support\u00a0for an independent Palestinian state \u2013 leaving the US and Israel\u2019s allies isolated. Israel and the US maintain that a Palestinian state should only be established through a negotiated settlement. Another sticking point is UNRWA, the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, which plays a central role in feeding and sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israeli officials have long criticized UNRWA, accusing it of diverting aid to Hamas as well as having Hamas members in its ranks. More than a dozen countries suspended funding to the agency after Israel\u00a0accused at least 12 UNRWA staffers\u00a0of being involved in the October 7 terrorist attacks. Most have since resumed funding. In March, the agency accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, coercing them into making false confessions about the agency\u2019s ties to Hamas. In recent months, UNRWA has faced threats, harassment and violence perpetrated by Israelis \u2013 with the East Jerusalem headquarters set on fire while staff were inside. CNN cannot confirm the allegations by Israel or UNRWA. In their report on Wednesday, the commission authors urged Israel to immediately call a ceasefire, for Hamas to release hostages, for Israel to end its practices of sexual abuse against Palestinians, and to allow access for further investigations. \u201cIt is imperative that all those who have committed crimes be held accountable,\u201d said commission chair Navi Pillay. \u201cThe only way to stop the recurring cycles of violence, including aggression and retribution by both sides, is to ensure strict adherence to international law.\u201d This story has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/middleeast/un-report-israel-hamas-gaza-war-crimes-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_style_digital-dermatology-rise", "text": "Not so long ago, seeing a dermatologist was only deemed necessary if you had skin problems or possessed a famous face to be pored over in magazines or on the big screen. Not anymore. Whether it\u2019s due to the rise of social media or celebrity culture, the past decade has seen our quest for apparently flawless skin go up a gear. A recent study found Gen Z spend more cash\u202fon their skin than any other age group (and more than previous generations). And in 2023 alone, spending on skincare by tweens and teens \u202fleapt 20%. Technology has also made getting expert advice increasingly achievable, too. Online dermatology developed quickly during the pandemic when Covid-19 restrictions meant that over 90% of dermatologists were using \u201cteledermatology\u201d (e.g. video calls and digital images to discuss skin concerns remotely) compared to 14.1% pre-Covid, said the American Academy of Dermatology. The advent of digital dermatology, pushed forward by increasingly innovative and sophisticated digital tools \u2014\u00a0not only smartphones and video calling apps but artificial intelligence \u2014 is enabling a growing number of global brands to diagnose, prescribe and produce bespoke creams via virtual consultation rooms. It\u2019s dermatology without the wait list, minus the travel and, somewhat ironically, without the need for a face-to-face interaction. But is it any good? \u201cThe pandemic clearly accelerated the popularity of digital dermatology and (it) is rapidly advancing, encompassing not only teledermatology but also consumer tech, machine learning, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence,\u201d said Shoshana Marmon, Assistant Professor of Dermatology at New York Medical College. \u201cThe increased sophistication of remote offerings is a natural progression.\u201d I have never visited a dermatologist before (digitally or otherwise) or used a prescription cream, but aged 43, I am beginning to notice fine lines, large pores and signs of sun damage that require something stronger than my typical drugstore go-tos. I tried Klira, a digital dermatology service co-founded in 2021 by British dermatologist Dr. Emma Craythorne. After filling an online questionnaire about my medical history and lifestyle, I answered dozens of detailed questions about my face, sharing everything from my pore size and levels of sun exposure to shininess. This information is analyzed by Klira\u2019s in-house team of consultant dermatologists who review the questionnaire along with photos of my make-up free face. Within 24 hours, the results are back. I am a \u201cSkinSize 04,\u201d one of 12 skin categories defined by Dr. Craythorne to reflects how skin looks, feels and ages. Essentially, it means that while I have a tendency towards blocked follicles due to excess sebum, my skin is otherwise easy to manage, as long as I remember my SPF (and I haven\u2019t over the years). I am prescribed a bespoke \u201cKlira Solution\u201d to tackle \u201caccumulative UV exposure,\u201d which will be delivered straight to my door within seven days. It\u2019s for use at night and contains the chemical exfoliant tretinoin (only available on prescription) and the anti-inflammatory azelaic acid. The formula should enhance collagen production, strengthen skin barrier and even out skin tone. Support is attained via an online \u201cpersonal portal,\u201d which features instructions clinical notes, instructions on how to use the cream, plus recommendations for complimentary products to cleanse, moisturize and protect. There is a one and three-month check in via email, but you can contact the team online whenever you have questions. While the monthly subscription can be cancelled anytime on the \u00a365 flexible membership ($82), the idea is you continue until your skin goals have been reached and ideally beyond that to maintain results. Speedy, simple but not the same Although, changes to my skin might require patience (at least six weeks to see an increased \u201cglow\u201d), the speed and simplicity of the digital process itself is undoubtedly impressive. \u201cThese days, we want answers to our skin concerns fast and by using an online dermatology service, I got fantastic knowledge and experience without having to leave the house or be placed on a waiting list,\u201d said Claire Todd, 35, from Cleethorpes, England who turned to Klira to treat pigmentation. \u201cI was dubious at first as I\u2019ve used creams in the past to no avail, but after eight weeks, I could see there was a difference and at 12 weeks, (my patches of pigmentation) had almost completely gone.\u201d In Los Angeles, Emily Thompson, also 35, used an AI-powered skin technology created by Dr Simon Ourian \u2014 dermatologist to the likes of Kim Kardashian and Megan Fox \u2014 to rejuvenate her skin. An uploaded photo is analyzed by AI \u2014 alongside a detailed questionnaire about your lifestyle and skin concerns \u2014 before an avatar of Dr Simon prescribes personalized products known as the \u201c3 Daily Essentials\u201d (cleanser, toner moisturizer). \u201cI\u2019d read about Dr. Simon Ourian, so when I learned about his AI-powered skin analysis, I wanted to give it try.\u202fMy life is busy and finding time for in-person specialist appointments was always a challenge,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThis analysis doesn\u2019t replace in-person visits for serious skin concerns,\u202fbut it worked for what I needed \u2014 my skin to feel hydrated, smoother and more radiant. I love\u202fthat I get to do this\u202ffrom home.\u201d While digital dermatology makes it possible to access the expertise of people who might otherwise be out of your price bracket or zip code, there are inevitable drawbacks and limitations to using a digital dermatologist exclusively. \u201cWhile it can offer many benefits, there are situations where in-person consultations are essential, particularly for complex or serious skin conditions requiring physical examination, biopsy or blood tests,\u201d says Dr\u202fIfeoma\u202fEjikeme, Medical Director and Founder of Adonia Medical Clinic in London. It is why Bryony Firth-Bernard, 28, from Gloucestershire, England decided to see a dermatologist in real life to get some help with her severe acne. \u201cI decided to see a dermatologist face-to-face because I\u2019d tried using an online service and there was no change in my skin. Seeing someone was the best money I\u2019ve ever spent. I was put on Roaccutane, which requires blood tests and is not something to be taken lightly, but it was transformative,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cI understand why people would choose a digi dermatologist, acne crushes your confidence, and you\u2019ll do anything to fix it, and it works for some people, but what I needed could only be prescribed by someone in person.\u201d Even if you do not require in-person treatment, the absence of human contact might not be for everyone. Christal Alert, 29, founder and CEO of Tonal Cosmetics based in New York used online dermatology service Apostrophe to treat severe acne and hyperpigmentation and has mixed feelings about the experience. \u201cAlthough it was not a total transformation, my skin did get a bit better and I would recommend the digital dermatologist route,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy and hassle-free but I felt direct communication with the dermatologist on a virtual call to discuss treatment options in more detail would have enhanced the experience. As with any treatment, it may require further trial and error to find the perfect solution.\u201d If you do decide to dip your toe, be sure to do your homework. \u201cLook at the platform\u2019s reputation and track record in delivering accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations. Ask who the provider is, and whether they have the correct credentials and training to give skin or skincare recommendations,\u201d advised Dr Ejikeme. \u201cCheck how the platforms ensures privacy and data security, and check what the process is for follow-up consultations and referrals when more help is needed.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/style/digital-dermatology-rise/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_sport_willie-mack-iii-us-open-car-spt-intl", "text": "For even the most talented golfers, it\u2019s a long road to the US Open. Willie Mack III knows that better than anyone \u2013 he\u2019s slept on several of them. The Michigan-born 35-year-old made an impressive start on his major debut at the 124th edition of his national open on Thursday, outperforming some of the game\u2019s biggest names amid supremely challenging conditions at Pinehurst\u2019s No.2 course in North Carolina. A one-over par 71 matched the best efforts of world No.1 and overwhelming tournament favorite Scottie Scheffler, while trumping the opening scores carded by an array of other stars, from defending winner Wyndham Clark to multiple major champion Jordan Spieth and Mack\u2019s very own idol, Tiger Woods. Yet just over a decade ago, as Woods eased ever closer to the all-time PGA Tour win record, Mack was easing himself into his Ford Mustang to settle down for the night. While 15-time major winner Woods was granted a special exemption \u2013 the first of his career \u2013 to tee it up this week, Mack has taken a far more winding path to Pinehurst. The abridged version is that he stamped his ticket by edging through a qualifying playoff in Florida last week, but that does little to capture all the contours of an arduous journey. Born in Flint, Mack scooped a host of junior titles in his home city before turning heads with a decorated college career that saw him clinch 11 individual titles at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida. In 2011, he became the first Black player to win the Michigan Amateur Championship. In a 2021 interview with Michigan-based media group MLive, Mack said he had experienced racial prejudice during his time in youth golf. \u201cGrowing up, going to some courses \u2026 you get looks or just don\u2019t get treated the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s just life. You have to deal with it, keep your head on straight and keep moving.\u201d \u2018I just thought it was embarassing\u2019 Mack turned professional a few months after that triumph, throwing himself into regional circuits like the Florida Professional Golf Tour, as well as the Advocates Professional Golf Association (APGA) Tour, launched to promote diversity in the sport. The first year went well, but Mack soon felt the financial strain of funding his own way around the country to a myriad of mini-tours \u2013 more than 30 and counting, he estimated to Golf.com earlier this week. By 2012, he was sleeping on the sofas of friends or \u2013 unbeknownst to his mother \u2013 in his own car. For more than year and a half, the latter setup would see Mack park up at tournaments well before tee off time to take a shower and avoid being noticed, he said. \u201cAt the time, I just thought it was embarrassing,\u201d Mack told Golf.com. \u201cBut that\u2019s all I had to try and get by. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s people that people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through and doing things you\u2019d never expect \u2026 \u201cI would actually practice more because I just didn\u2019t want to get back in the car. I would go to the mall a lot and just walk around, things to not be in the car. And then play a tournament and do it all again tomorrow.\u201d Repeated attempts to make it onto the PGA Tour through qualifying school fell short, but a breakthrough arrived in 2018 when Mack battled his way onto the PGA Tour Latinoamerica. He played only two events \u2013 making just $766 in total \u2013 but it would mark the start of increasingly regular outings on the game\u2019s most prestigious circuits. Last year, he played 20 tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour \u2013 the PGA Tour\u2019s developmental track \u2013 earning just over $45,000 in prize money in the process. Ahead of this week, Mack has played seven PGA Tour events, his best performance a tied-64th finish at the 2021 John Deere Classic. \u2018You just gotta keep fighting\u2019 Yet heading into this month, a major appearance had remained agonizingly elusive. It had not been for the want of trying, with Mack agonizingly missing out on a US Open field spot a few years ago by losing in a playoff. Fast-forward to The Bear\u2019s Club in Orlando on June 3, and the journeyman golfer found himself in the same position once again. Dubbed \u2018golf\u2019s longest day,\u2019 the final round of US Open qualifying sees amateurs and professionals alike embark on a grueling 36-hole marathon to clinch the final few starting places at the major. Having battled through local qualifying in April, Mack finished in a three-way tie for the fifth and final spot available to the 73 hopefuls at Bear\u2019s Club. With both his counterparts bogeying in succession, back-to-back pars were enough for Mack to exorcise his playoff demons and stamp his ticket to Pinehurst. \u201cYou just gotta keep fighting. My Dad always told me never to give up and I always keep that in the back of my mind,\u201d Mack told NBC Sports after his triumph. \u201cTo be able to do it today is remarkable. I can\u2019t believe it actually happened,\u201d he added. Among the first groups to tee off Thursday, Mack\u2019s name floated near the top of the leaderboard for some time as the world No. 1351 raced out of the blocks with two birdies across his first six holes. He was two-under as he geared up for the final four holes, a score that would have ultimately put him within just three shots of round one leaders Rory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay, only for three late bogeys to bump him above par. Even so, Mack put up a showing the majority of the 156-player would have happily taken as a firm and fast No. 2 course chewed up many of the game\u2019s elite. \u201cI wasn\u2019t as nervous as I probably was before playing in some PGA Tour events,\u201d Mack told reporters after his round. \u201cPlaying full season last year, I guess it got me ready for these type of situations. It\u2019s still the US Open, so you got to focus, put your head down and hit some great shots.\u201d Among the final groups to start their second round at 2:42 p.m. ET (7:42 p.m. BST) on Friday, Flint is well-positioned to make the cut and pen a major weekend chapter in the long story of his career. \u201cIt\u2019s a special week for me,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything happens for a reason. I think this is my time to play well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/willie-mack-iii-us-open-car-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_wwii-vet-marries-intl-scli", "text": "Together, the collective age of the bride and groom was nearly 200. But World War II\u00a0veteran Harold Terens\u00a0and his sweetheart Jeanne Swerlin proved that love is eternal as they tied the knot Saturday inland of the D-Day beaches in Normandy, France. Their respective ages \u2014 he\u2019s 100, she\u2019s a youngster of just 96 \u2014 made their nuptials an almost double-century celebration. Terens called it \u2033the best day of my life.\u2033 On her way\u00a0into the nuptials, the bubbly bride-to-be said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just for young people, love, you know? We get butterflies. And we get a little action, also.\u2033 The location was the elegant stone-worked town hall of Carentan, a key initial D-Day objective that saw ferocious fighting after the June 6, 1944, Allied landings that helped\u00a0rid Europe of Adolf Hitler\u2019s tyranny. Like other towns and villages across the Normandy coast where nearly 160,000 Allied troops came ashore under fire on five code-named beaches, it was an effervescent hub of remembrance and\u00a0celebration on the 80th anniversary\u00a0of the deeds and sacrifices of young men and women that day, festooned with flags and bunting and with veterans feted like rockstars. As the swing of Glenn Miller and other period tunes rang out on the streets, well-wishers \u2013 some in WWII-period clothes \u2013 were already lined up a good hour before the wedding, behind barriers outside the town hall, with a rousing pipe and drum band also on hand to serenade the happy couple. After both declaring \u201coui\u201d to vows read by Carentan\u2019s mayor in English, the couple exchanged rings. \u201cWith this ring, I thee wed,\u201d Terens said. She giggled and gasped, \u201cReally?\u201d With champagne flutes in hand, they waved through an open window to the crowds outside. \u201cTo everybody\u2019s good health. And to peace in the world and the preservation of democracy all over the world and the end of the war in Ukraine and Gaza,\u201d Terens said as he and his bride then clinked glasses and drank. The crowd yelled \u201cla mari\u00e9e!\u201d - the bride! \u2013 to Swerlin, who wore a long, flowing dress of vibrant pink. Terens looked dapper in a light-blue suit and pink kerchief in his breast pocket. And they enjoyed a very special wedding-night party: They were invited to the state dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Saturday night with\u00a0President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden. \u201cCongratulations to the newlyweds,\u201d Macron said, prompting cheers and a standing ovation from other guests during the toast praising French-American friendship. \u201c(The town of) Carentan was happy to host your wedding, and us, your wedding dinner,\u201d he told the couple. The wedding was symbolic, not binding in law. Mayor Jean-Pierre Lhonneur\u2019s office said he wasn\u2019t empowered to wed foreigners who aren\u2019t residents of Carentan, and that the couple, who are both American, hadn\u2019t requested legally binding vows.However, they could always complete those formalities back in Florida if they wished. Lhonneur likes to say that Normandy is practically the 51st state of the US, given its reverence and gratitude for Allied soldiers and the sacrifices of tens of thousands who never made it home from the Battle of Normandy. \u201cLove is eternal, yes, maybe,\u201d the mayor said, referring to the newlyweds, although his comments also fittingly describe the feelings of many Normans for veterans. \u201cI hope for them the best happiness together.\u201d Dressed in a 1940s dress that belonged to her mother, Louise, and a red beret, 73-year-old Jane Ollier was among spectators who waited for a glimpse of the lovebirds. The couple, both widowed, grew up in New York City: she in Brooklyn, he in the Bronx. \u201cIt\u2019s so touching to get married at that age,\u2019\u2019 Ollier said. \u201cIf it can bring them happiness in the last years of their lives, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d The WWII veteran first visited France as a 20-year-old US Army Air Forces corporal shortly after D-Day. Terens enlisted in 1942 and, after shipping to Britain, was attached to a four-pilot P-47 Thunderbolt fighter unit as their radio repair technician. On D-Day, Terens helped repair planes returning from France so they could rejoin the battle. He said half his company\u2019s pilots died that day. Terens himself went to France 12 days later, helping transport freshly captured Germans and just-freed American POWs to England. Following the Nazi surrender in May 1945, Terens again helped transport freed Allied prisoners to England before he shipped back to the US a month later. Swerlin made it abundantly clear that her new centenarian husband doesn\u2019t lack for\u00a0rizz. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest kisser ever, you know?\u201d she proudly declared before they embraced enthusiastically for TV cameras. \u201cAll right! That\u2019s it for now !\u201d Terens said as he came up for air. To which she quipped: \u201cYou mean there\u2019s more later?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/wwii-vet-marries-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_americas_edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-profile-intl-latam", "text": "Restraint is a rare quality for a politician, especially in Venezuela, a country whose recent leaders have been synonymous with vitriolic populism. Hugo Chavez, the late president who still casts a formidable shadow across the country more than ten years after his death, used to speak for hours on his television show,\u00a0Hello President!, while his firebrand successor, incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, is equally capable of clocking 60-plus minutes of uninterrupted oratory when the mood takes him. So it\u2019s telling that the man tasked with challenging Maduro in Venezuela\u2019s presidential election next month is a man of few words. Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the official candidate of a large opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform, has a habit of answering his questions in single sentences, often stopping before the interviewer has the time to think of a follow-up. It\u2019s an unexpected approach from a presidential candidate aiming to drum up voter enthusiasm in order to take on an authoritarian leader who in the last ten years has dug into power by allegedly rigging elections and\u00a0violating human rights. But Gonzalez is not your typical Venezuelan politician. After decades in the foreign service (he was an ambassador to Algeria and Argentina) and then as a back bench manager for Venezuela\u2019s opposition, Gonzalez was only selected as a coalition candidate because two other opposition leaders \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 had been barred from running and a deadline was looming. \u201cI never imagined I would find myself in this situation,\u201d he told Venezuelan media in late April, shortly after his candidature was formalized. Yet since then, his poise and calm have helped him build a comfortable lead against Maduro, according to recent polls. Opposition, a dangerous business Challenging Maduro\u2019s near total grip on power can be a dangerous business. Over the years, he has jailed or exiled dozens of opposition leaders, some of them for years. And hundreds of people have been killed in political violence in Venezuela in the past decade, often at the hands of state security forces. But most analysts agree Gonzalez represents the best chance that Venezuela\u2019s political opposition has had to dislodge Maduro from power since 2013. His name is already on the ballot for the July 28 presidential vote, and the government has so far shown little appetite for going after him. In October, the Maduro government and the opposition, along with representatives from the United States, signed a comprehensive agreement in Barbados where Maduro pledged to hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief from Washington. Since then, there have been mixed signals on both sides about the extent of the deal: US-imposed oil sanctions have only partially been lifted and most of Maduro\u2019s close circle is still subject to individual sanctions, while on May 28, Caracas withdrew an invitation for the European Union to send electoral observers to monitor the upcoming vote. Gonzalez claims he\u2019s not worried about possible persecution, telling CNN En Espa\u00f1ol that he is \u201cvery calm, confident although aware of the enormous challenge\u201d the opposition is up against. Asked about the prospect of a repeat of the 2018 election, which Maduro won amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging and a boycott by the opposition, Gonzalez says he hopes pressure from other countries will force Maduro\u2019s hand. Most experts say the international community is unlikely to intervene in Venezuela again after the debacle of the 2019 opposition uprising led by Juan Guaido, the then-opposition leader who swore himself in as interim president and was recognized by more than fifty countries \u2013 only for Maduro to retain power and ride out the storm unscathed. But Gonzalez seems buoyant nonetheless. \u201cFraud, vote rigging, and threats are nothing new for us,\u201d Gonzalez told CNN En Espa\u00f1ol, \u201cBut we\u2019re confident that on the day the opposition vote will be so massive our victory will be indisputable.\u201d His family is not so tranquil. \u201cWe are worried, no doubt,\u201d Gonzalez\u2019s daughter Mariana told CNN. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to live one day at a time, because if we start thinking of what could happen, this or that, we stop moving,\u201d she said. The biggest question But how to convince an authoritarian government entrenched in power for decades to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition? Gonzalez has never offered an answer to the question that hangs the July vote. Instead of detailing a roadmap to democracy, he has only hinted at what steps he would take should he win in July and the electoral authority effectively certify the result. He said his biggest priorities would be\u00a0taming\u00a0inflation, another of Venezuela\u2019s chronic ills\u00a0and\u00a0currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in\u00a0the\u00a0institutions of power\u00a0such as the judiciary, currently stacked by Maduro\u2019s sympathizers. The fate of the incumbent and his closest allies \u2013 several of whom are under investigation in the Hague for crimes against humanity \u2013 remain in the balance. But amnesty for outgoing officials could be on the table, Gonzalez told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIn all political transitions and political crises, you have amnesty agreements and transitional justice. All the countries who have gone through situations like ours have ended up granting it, so I don\u2019t rule out we could take a similar measure in Venezuela,\u201d he said. While the election is slated for late July, Venezuela law mandates that the winning candidate won\u2019t take office before January 2025 \u2013 creating a delicate 6-month handover period that Gonzalez would have to manage carefully if he wins. \u201cThose six months will be key for him as a president-elect, while the entire state apparatus remains under the control of the regime,\u201d said Sadio Garavini di Tullio, a classmate of Gonzalez who also served in the foreign office and helped manage the opposition in the Chavez years. \u201cEdmundo however can be that person; he can give a lot of guarantees to everyone involved with the regime.\u201d \u201cHe will not be the president of the opposition government, he\u2019ll be the president of the transition government,\u201d Garavini di Tullio said. George Eickhoff, a German diplomat who served as director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Caracas between 2008 and 2013 and remains close to Gonzalez, made a similar point. \u201cEdmundo is a public servant, he knows there cannot be any revenge [against the government],\u201d Eickhoff told CNN. \u201cHe has already started to speak to the other side: for the opposition, Machado is the firebrand messenger to galvanize its base, while Edmundo is an extension of the soft message, he\u2019s very realistic about his task.\u201d Asked about the possibility of vote-rigging by the Maduro regime, Gonzalez was sanguine. \u201cWe\u2019re aware we\u2019re facing an enemy,\u201d he began \u2013 then corrected himself, softening the message: \u201cAn adversary that has no qualms about using any advantage the system gives them.\u201d Grandfather figure The dual message has been visible throughout this first month of the political campaigning period, with Machado, a long-time conservative politician who first ran for president in 2012, holding public rallies in every street, while Gonzalez has dispensed calmness from his home in Caracas. When Gonzalez\u2019s candidature was formalized in April, a portrait of him by Bloomberg photographer Gaby Oraa went viral in Venezuela. It shows the candidate feeding four colorful tropical parrots called\u00a0guacamayas, typical of Caracas. Across the city, citizens routinely feed these wild birds who can display a pet-like loyalty. \u201cThey come every day, two, three, four\u2026 sometimes even ten. They are his friends,\u201d said Mariana, Gonzalez\u2019s daughter. \u201cThe\u00a0guacamayas\u00a0come in the morning and in the evening, he can spend hours just feeding them sunflower seeds. He takes care of them.\u201d His other passions, according to those who know him well, are baseball, the Real Madrid football club, family barbecues, and reading. Fans see in him a grandfather-of-the-nation type figure who could usher in a new era after the political violence of the last decade, pointing to his electoral slogan \u201cEdmundo, president for all\u201d, as well as his age (73) and family situation (he has four grandchildren). Two of those grandchildren now live in Spain, among the more than seven million Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years. He hopes that an opposition victory in July would encourage at least some of that diaspora to return. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the big Venezuelan family to come together once more,\u201d he told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIt\u2019s time that the adversary is respected as such, and not seen as an enemy,\u201d he added. A message again, of moderation and transition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/americas/edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-profile-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_ukraine-drone-strike-destroys-russian-su57-stealth-fighter-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s military on Sunday said it had destroyed one of Russia\u2019s newest and most advanced fighter jets in a drone strike on a military base deep inside Russia. The Sukhoi Su-57 fighter, nicknamed the \u201cFelon\u201d by NATO, was struck on the tarmac of an airbase in the Astrakhan region, almost 600 kilometers (372 miles) behind the front lines of fighting in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukraine\u2019s defense intelligence agency (GUR). The agency posted satellite pictures in a post on its Telegram channel to support its claim, writing, \u201cThe images show that on June 7, Su-57 was still intact, but on June 8, craters from the explosion and distinctive fire spots emerged near it as a result of the fire damage.\u201d The Su-57 is a supersonic, twin-engine, fifth-generation stealth fighter jet and was seen as Moscow\u2019s answer to Western stealth jets like the US Air Force\u2019s F-22 Raptor. But its development, which began in 2002, according to the US military, has been slow, and an Su-57 crashed during a 2019 test flight. The Russian military received its first Su-57 in 2020, according to a report by the state-run TASS news agency, which said the jet was earlier \u201ctested\u201d in combat conditions in Syria in 2018. The Ukrainian Telegram post noted the Su-57\u2019s ability to carry Kh-59 and Kh-69 cruise missiles, which the jet could launch against Ukraine from the safety of Russian airspace. While experts have expressed doubts on the Su-57\u2019s capabilities compared to the F-22, Russian officials have praised its role in attacks on Ukraine. In a 2022 TASS report, then Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the Su-57 \u201chas shown itself brilliantly.\u201d \u201cThe aircraft has a very high degree of protection against various air defense systems, has protection against missiles \u2026 Most importantly, it has very powerful weapons. We also tried and tested these weapons, they work brilliantly,\u201d Shoigu said at the time. The exact number of combat-ready Su-57s available to Russia\u2019s air force is unclear. Flight Global\u2019s \u201cWorld Air Forces 2024\u201d directory lists 14 Su-57s as active and another 62 as on order. \u201cThe Russian Aerospace Forces currently have only a limited number of these combat aircraft in service,\u201d the GUR Telegram post said. TASS reported in 2022 that Russian forces will receive a total of 22 Su-57s by the end of this year. If the reports of the Ukrainian drone strike deep inside Russia prove true, it marks another success of Kyiv\u2019s low-cost drones taking out high-value Russian assets. The price of an Su-57 is estimated to be $35 million to $54 million, according to the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Drone strikes have become an increasing problem for Moscow. Other Ukrainian drones have been used to sink or severely damage Russian warships in the Black Sea, and tanks and armored vehicles have fallen prey to drones on the battlefield. The attack would also bring new worries for Russia in protecting bases far back from the battlefield. \u201cThis is a really a trend that the Russians are worried about,\u201d said CNN contributor Jill Dougherty, the network\u2019s former Moscow bureau chief. \u201cThe Ukrainians are attacking more and more inside Russia and taking the battle to them,\u201d Dougherty said. After reports of the strike surfaced, Russian military bloggers criticized the military for not building hangars to protect the Su-57s, noting that protective hangars could be constructed at every air base for the price of one Su-57, according to the Institute for the Study of War.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/ukraine-drone-strike-destroys-russian-su57-stealth-fighter-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_lgbtq-travel-destinations-homosexuality-criminalized", "text": "When Emma-Jane Nutbrown went on a family vacation to Jamaica last year, she did so with one condition: that everyone donated to an LGBTQ charity once they got there. Nutbrown felt uncomfortable with her parents\u2019 choice of destination. Same-sex sexual activity between men is against the law in Jamaica and carries a maximum jail term of 10 years with hard labor. Both Nutbrown and her brother, Simon \u2013 whose 40th birthday the family was celebrating on that trip \u2013 are gay. \u201cIt made Simon uneasy going there, but most people like to travel for the place, not the politics behind it, so we couldn\u2019t really hold my parents accountable,\u201d says Nutbrown, founder of Queer Edge, which creates safe spaces for the community in London. \u201cI won\u2019t refuse to travel somewhere with family, but I will raise it.\u00a0So instead of us refusing to go, Simon made everyone donate to a charity out there as his birthday present.\u201d Nutbrown and her brother are some of the millions worldwide who have an extra layer to consider when booking a vacation: Will they be safe in the destination, and how are local members of the LGBTQ community treated? \u201cI\u2019m predominantly against it [travel to destinations where homosexuality is banned], but I\u2019m pragmatic. It\u2019s not as easy as \u2018Don\u2019t go,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cIf there was a shared consensus across the planet [to boycott destinations] then it would work, but I think it\u2019s a lot more complex.\u201d There are 62 countries worldwide that still criminalize (or de facto criminalize) homosexuality, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), which counts UN member states. The Human Dignity Trust counts 64. Of these, 12 could potentially impose the death penalty for same-sex activity, including tourist favorite the United Arab Emirates; Qatar, whose airline was this week deemed the best in the world; Nigeria, which welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May; and Saudi Arabia, which last year claimed that it welcomed LGBTQ travelers. Many people \u2013 even those outside the LGBTQ community \u2013 simply will not travel to countries where homosexuality is illegal. Corey O\u2019Neill, an office manager from London, is one. \u201cSafety is at the forefront of anyone\u2019s mind when traveling,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not visibly queer, there\u2019s an innate danger that how you act might be perceived as gay, which entails not only formal punishments, but police brutality, hate crimes, the general atmosphere. I don\u2019t want to have that in my mind on vacation.\u201d O\u2019Neill\u2019s stance means that unless laws change, he will never see the pyramids (Egypt has de-facto criminalized homosexuality with jail-term punishment); sleep overwater in the Maldives (up to eight years jail-time plus 100 lashes); take a Kenyan safari (maximum 14 years imprisonment); see Red Square (Russia designates the LGBTQ movement \u2013 even displaying a rainbow flag \u2013 as \u2018extremist\u2019 with up to 12-year sentences); or stop over in Qatar (up to 10 years in prison, with \u201cno legal certainty\u201d over a potential death penalty). But he\u2019s OK with that. \u201cWhy would I give money to a country that doesn\u2019t want me to exist? Even if $10 went towards a tax that actively harmed people, that\u2019d be my money I gave them.\u201d It\u2019s not just LGBTQ people who feel this way. Members and allies of the community are currently in their 10th year of boycotting the Dorchester Collection hotels, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (part of the Ministry of Finance and Economy), since the country introduced laws authorizing the stoning to death of LGBTQ people, as well as the public flogging of women for adultery. In 2019, George Clooney wrote of the importance of boycotting. But while a boycott may be possible against a business, some feel that swerving an entire country harms the local community even more. \u201cIt can cause a very visceral reaction in people, but there are 50 shades of discrimination, and the challenge is where you draw the line,\u201d says Darren Burn, founder of inclusive travel companies Out of Office and TravelGay. \u201cWould you go somewhere you can\u2019t get married, or can\u2019t go into the army? The reality is there are loads of places where, even if it\u2019s not illegal to be gay, there are challenges. I totally respect that some people don\u2019t want to support an economy where [homosexuality] is illegal. But the other side is that I want to go, and by going, I\u2019m helping to change mindsets. Every country has gay people. We hear from staff members and locals in destinations, who say, \u2018Please come.\u2019 \u201d Burn never planned to enter the travel industry. He was a journalist when he went on holiday to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. \u201cI was in my early 20s, and I was a bit na\u00efve. It was Sharm \u2013 a tourist haven,\u201d he says. \u201cI was traveling with my ex, and we weren\u2019t allowed to check in. We had to go to another hotel. I thought, that shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone, ever.\u201d In 2016, he founded Out of Office, building a contact book of \u201cwelcoming suppliers and tour guides.\u201d \u2018Do you need two beds?\u2019 In recent years, destination marketers have become more vociferous in attracting LGBTQ clients. There\u2019s usually a financial reason behind it, says Burn. Travelers from the community \u201care less likely to have children and more likely to have disposable income. They\u2019re loyal customers and trust word-of-mouth referrals.\u201d Sherwin Banda, president of luxury safari provider African Travel Inc says that the LGBTQ community has \u201cthe largest disposable income of any other niche market.\u201d \u201cA destination\u2019s reputation as being LGBT-friendly is a primary motivation for us,\u201d he says. A 2021 report from nonprofit Open for Business showed that Caribbean nations outlawing homosexuality saw their GDP hit by up to 5.7% and lost the tourist industry $423 million to $689 million annually. In Jamaica,\u00a0tourism officials\u00a0have tried to downplay the impact of the island nation\u2019s laws against homosexuality. In 2022, legislation was repealed in Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Trinidad and Tobago had already decriminalized same-sex relations in 2018; in April 2024, Dominica followed suit. \u201cThe Caribbean is moving quite quickly,\u201d says Burn, who adds that the anti-homosexuality laws in many Caribbean and African countries were established under European colonialism. Banda, who is South African, agrees. \u201cColonial laws combined with stringent religious beliefs have prolonged a stigma attached to homosexuality across Africa,\u201d he says. However, he is still comfortable arranging safaris for LGBTQ travelers. \u201cOnce we know travelers are from the community, we take great care to ensure guides, hotels, all the touchpoints throughout the journey are safe for them, but also inclusive,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody will say, \u2018Do you need two beds?\u2019 We ensure our clients don\u2019t have to come out again to everyone they meet in Africa.\u201d \u2018Tolerance is practiced not preached\u2019 The experience on the ground is often different from the letter of the law. As Burn says, \u201cIt\u2019s also illegal to drink alcohol in the Maldives, but all resorts have it.\u201d (He advises not holding hands at the airport, however.) In 2020, Bilal El Hammoumy and Rania Chentouf launched Inclusive Morocco, the first LGBT-founded tour operator in a country that punishes same-sex activity with up to three years in jail. \u201cBeing members of the community, we felt we would understand better how to approach it,\u201d says El Hammoumy. \u201cMorocco is a country where tolerance is practiced but not preached. \u201cWe could understand clients\u2019 fears, but on the other hand, it was important to create a space where the local LGBT community can be involved in training programs and hiring opportunities.\u201d El Hammoumy says that in Morocco, \u201cthe reality is a bit different from the law.\u201d In the early 20th century, cities such as Tangier were \u201cgay heavens\u201d for creatives escaping conservative Western countries. One of Marrakech\u2019s main sights is the Majorelle Garden, where the ashes of former owner Yves Saint Laurent were scattered by his former partner, Pierre Berg\u00e9. El Hammoumy says that Moroccan hotels are generally accepting of same-sex couples, but those they work with have extra training to ensure travelers are comfortable. Some guides have opted not to work with them when they explain their clientele, he says. However, he says that visiting destinations can change mindsets. \u201cA lot of anti-LGBT feelings come from prejudice and a lack of education, and direct contact can change preconceived ideas about the community,\u201d he says. Burn agrees. There\u2019s the economic incentive, too. Banda, who grew up under apartheid, believes that South Africa would not have changed without economic pressure from the wider world. \u201cTravel does something no other industry can do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfrica is heavily dependent on tourism dollars. We can advocate for inclusivity with partners who are prepared to actively welcome our guests. If we stay away, we lose that opportunity to use our voice.\u201d Travel can \u2018bring change\u2019 Does that mean every country should be showered in travel dollars in a bid to change opinions? Not according to these experts, none of whom would send a client to Saudi Arabia. Uganda is another sticking point \u2013 its 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act legalized the targeting of the LGBTQ community in myriad ways and even carries the death sentence. \u201cAs a company, you need to stand for something, and Uganda advocates for brutal violent acts against gay people. We cannot in good conscience send people there,\u201d says Banda. Michael Kajubi has a different perspective. In 2013 he founded McBern Tours, curating Uganda tours, after being fired from his previous job because of \u201csuspicions\u201d that he was gay. \u201cI had to start a company to employ myself and people like me who could not get jobs because of who they are,\u201d he says. The majority of McBern staff are LGBTQ, and all profits go to the McBern Foundation, which supports elderly Ugandans and marginalized youths. Kajubi \u2013 who left Uganda four years ago because of his activism \u2013 says that he is still comfortable sending LGBTQ travelers there, as long as they \u201crespect the laws \u2013 don\u2019t wave their rainbow flag all over the place.\u201d All the hotels that McBern uses \u2013 even for straight guests \u2013 have been carefully vetted as LGBTQ-friendly, says Kajubi. He believes travelers should still visit these destinations but be vigilant where their money is going. He suggests looking for tour operators affiliated to the IGLTA, so that you can be sure you\u2019re not funding inequality. Boycotting leaves the local community stranded, he argues. Companies that have stopped working with McBern because of Uganda\u2019s anti-gay legislation \u201chave a valid point, but supporting local companies can bring change. You\u2019re paying salaries for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be employed.  \u201cIf people don\u2019t come we can\u2019t support [Foundation] beneficiaries with healthcare, tuition and basic needs.\u201d \u2018Discrimination all over the place\u2019 Of course, discrimination isn\u2019t confined to countries where homosexuality is illegal. For starters, over 500 anti-LGBTQ laws were introduced in US state legislatures last year alone. In May, the US State Department issued a worldwide alert about potential attacks on LGBTQ+ people and events. In 2014, Matthieu Jost founded MisterB&B, an LGBTQ travel community with 1.3 million members, after an Airbnb host in Barcelona made it clear that he and his partner were unwelcome. Previously, a French hotel had refused him and his then-boyfriend a double bed. \u201cThis kind of discrimination is all over the place, even in 2024,\u201d says Jost, who won\u2019t even hold hands with his partner in Paris. Banda won\u2019t do that in Los Angeles, either. For Jost, traveling to a country where homosexuality is banned means abiding by local rules. MisterB&B users are not allowed to book travel in a country with the death penalty for same-sex behavior. In a destination where it\u2019s illegal, users are flagged before booking. \u201cWe warn travelers they need to be cautious. Ask for separate beds, don\u2019t show personal gestures, let family know where they\u2019re traveling and have the embassy contact,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you really want to go there, you need to respect the laws and religion of these countries and play the game.\u201d Burn adds that booking with a specialist is essential \u2013 his staff have mystery-shopped mainstream tour operators and found them lacking in knowledge, he says. For O\u2019Neill, and many like him, it\u2019s not enough. \u201cI know it limits where I can go \u2013 I\u2019ll probably never see the pyramids or go on safari. But there are so many beautiful places in the world that support queer people. That sounds like a much nicer vacation to me.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/lgbtq-travel-destinations-homosexuality-criminalized/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England. In 1995, it was stolen from Longleat, the home of Thynne\u2019s descendants, and disappeared for seven years, before it was found at a bus stop in London by art detective Charles Hill. \u201cThis is a painting, then, that has been coveted by aristocrats, archdukes and emperors alike: prized for its vividly coloured scene of familial affection within the natural world,\u201d Christie\u2019s said in the statement. \u201cLike its subjects,\u00a0The Rest on the Flight into Egypt\u00a0has been on a long and eventful journey \u2014 a journey that\u2019s far from over.\u201d The painting will be offered as part of the Old Masters Part I auction at Christie\u2019s in London on July 2.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/style/titian-painting-auction-scli-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_middleeast_andrey-kozlov-family-israel-hamas-gaza-intl", "text": "The family of\u00a0one of the hostages rescued in an Israeli operation over the weekend has said that he experienced psychological abuse over the hands of his Hamas captors during the eight months that he was held in Gaza. Andrey\u00a0Kozlov, 27, was rescued alongside Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan and Shlomi Ziv during a raid on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Saturday. The operation was only the third Israeli rescue of hostages held in Gaza and has been celebrated in Israel. But it left a trail of devastation, with authorities in Gaza saying at least 274 Palestinians were killed in the raid and the ensuing firefight with Hamas militants. Kozlov and the others were held in two civilian buildings in the densely packed territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said that the raid was carried out in the two buildings simultaneously for fear the captors would kill some of the hostages if they knew an operation was unfolding. A Russian citizen, Kozlov moved to Israel almost two years ago. He was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival on October 7 when he was kidnapped and taken into Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Kozlov\u2019s family revealed\u00a0some details of their son\u2019s ordeal, including that he initially believed the Israeli forces who saved him had been sent to kill him. Kozlov\u2019s father, Mikhail Kozlov, said his son was \u201cvery scared\u201d because Hamas militants had\u00a0for months\u00a0falsely said that \u201cIsrael wanted to kill them all\u201d\u00a0claiming \u201cthey were a problem for Israel\u201d. \u201cHe was told that Israel wants to kill him. He didn\u2019t understand why the IDF\u00a0came. He was afraid that the IDF came to kill him. It took him some time to realize that they came to rescue him.\u201d Mikhail said his son would not reveal all the ways he\u2019d been mistreated,\u00a0saying\u00a0\u201che wasn\u2019t seen as a human by them.\u201d \u201cI would say that they would punish him for any behavior that they considered was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the examples that Andrey gave us\u2026 is that at the hottest time of the day they would cover him with blankets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very difficult ordeal. To be dehydrated during heat.\u201d His\u00a0brother, Dmitry, said\u00a0\u201cthey were trying not to leave [physical] marks \u2026 But they would still punish him this way or the other. Very often for trivial things.\u201d \u201cHe was told not to speak in Hebrew, you need to whisper and [even that] in English.\u201d Describing their reunion, Mikhail said: \u201cThe first meeting was very touching\u2026 We expected to have a vibrant meeting and some joy, but instead, he knelt down and burst into tears and that was very moving for us.\u201d Dmitry said his brother feels indebted to Israel. \u201cHe says that he doesn\u2019t understand what he has done to deserve this generosity towards him, because he hasn\u2019t done anything. So he feels obliged to pass this goodness on to the next person and help get others [hostages] out.\u201d With the rescue of the four hostages, 116 remain in Gaza from the October 7 attacks, of which 41 are believed to be dead. Mikhail said that he was in favor of securing the release of the remaining hostages by any means \u2013 by negotiation, or further military action. \u201cIf it can be a deal, if a deal can help to release them, then be it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s possible to carry such an operation again, then it should be an operation for the release of these hostages. We need to use any means to return these people back to their families.\u201d \u2018A lot of abuse, almost every day\u2019 The doctor in charge of medical treatment for the four Israeli hostages rescued Saturday said they were beaten while in Hamas captivity in Gaza. \u201cIt was a harsh, harsh, experience, with a lot of abuse, almost every day,\u201d Dr. Itai Pessach told CNN. \u201cEvery hour, both physical, mental and other types, and that is something that is beyond comprehension.\u201d Pessach said the eight months spent in captivity \u201cleft a significant mark on their health\u201d and despite appearing in good condition initially, they are all malnourished.\u00a0 \u201cThey had no protein, so their muscles are extremely wasted, there is damage to some other systems because of that.\u201d He said the hostages told him they were moved several times, dealing with a number of different guards. The supply of food and water was unstable. \u201cThere have been periods where they got almost no food whatsoever, there were other periods where it was a little better, but all in all, the combination of the psychological stress, malnutrition or not getting enough food or not getting the right kind of food, medical neglect, being limited to space, not seeing the sun and all of the other things have significant effect on health.\u201d The testimony is the latest insight into conditions Hamas keeps hostages in. Other hostages\u00a0have previously outlined their ordeals. Keren Munder, her mother and her 9-year-old son \u2013 who were among scores of hostages released under a temporary truce last year - endured days with only pita bread to eat, according to her cousin Merav Mor Raviv. Munder and her mother both lost between six and eight kilograms in weight. Another hostage, 72-year-old Adina Moshe, endured \u201chorrible\u201d conditions while she was held captive, according to her nephew, who added that she didn\u2019t have access to basic facilities like a shower. Israel launched its war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage. Since then, the Israeli campaign has killed more than 37,000 people, according to the ministry of health in Gaza, and triggered a humanitarian crisis. Concerns over food insecurity and famine are growing, with a UN report warning recently that more than one million people, half of Gaza\u2019s population, are \u201cexpected to face death and starvation\u201d by mid-July.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/middleeast/andrey-kozlov-family-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home.

Video circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN showed the moment the blaze engulfed the six-story building in the Mafreg area of the city. Around 150 people were living in the block when fire broke out on the ground floor, police official Sayyed Hasan Ebrahim told Kuwaiti state television. The cause of the fire, which has been contained, is unknown but the presence of more than 20 cooking gas tanks and flammable material in the overcrowded block caused it to spread quickly, Ebrahim said. Most of the fatalities were due to suffocation, Gen. Eid Rashed, from the police criminal forensic department, told state television. He warned the death toll could rise, adding that 11 people were being treated in hospitals. Authorities had identified three of the bodies, he said, but did not say if their families had been notified. A fire department official said the large number of floors and escape corridors made it difficult for the trapped residents to escape the burning building. Indian nationals were among those killed, according to the Indian foreign ministry. The country\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the fire a \u201cmishap\u201d and described it as \u201csaddening.\u201d \u201cMy thoughts are with all those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest,\u201d Modi said on X. Modi also directed his government to \u201cextend all possible assistance\u201d to the Kuwait authorities. India\u2019s minister of external affairs is traveling to Kuwait to oversee relief efforts and repatriate deceased Indian citizens. India\u2019s Ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika visited several of the injured in hospital and the site of the fire. Photos of the aftermath show a blackened ground floor, with Kuwaiti security forces assessing the damage. The owner of the building has been detained and investigated for negligence, the reports added. Migrants make up two-thirds of Kuwait\u2019s private workforce, and rights groups have long said they face legal and discriminatory challenges not experienced by Kuwaiti nationals. Human Rights Watch\u2019s 2023 World Report\u00a0noted\u00a0migrant workers in Kuwait face \u201cverbal, physical and sexual abuse\u201d and are often \u201cforcibly confined in their employers\u2019 homes.\u201d A\u00a02023 study\u00a0by international and Kuwaiti researchers said Kuwait\u2019s existing labor regulations are inadequate, finding \u201csubstantial increases in occupational injury risk\u201d from hot temperatures despite a previous government effort to address the matter. \u201cSocially disadvantaged workers and migrant workers, in particular, can be disproportionately affected by hazardous heat,\u201d the study said. \u201cThese vulnerable workers tend to take risky jobs with little health and safety training, work longer hours, receive less pay, face cultural and language barriers, and fear a looming risk of deportation. They have been found to sustain greater rates of occupational injuries.\u201d The Embassy of the State of Kuwait in Washington did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.

The news of the disappearances comes just days after the body of British TV personality Michael Mosley was discovered after he vanished while walking in sizzling temperatures on the Greek island of Symi. A 59-year-old American man, who has been named as Albert Calibet, disappeared on the island of Amorgos on Tuesday while following a route toward the village of Katapola, the Amorgos municipality said on its official social media. Popi Despotidi, Amorgos\u2019 deputy mayor of tourism, told CNN on Thursday that Calibet has been coming \u201cto Amorgos almost every year\u201d for about a decade. And on the island of Samos, a 74-year-old Dutch tourist has been missing since Sunday, with a large search and rescue operation underway, authorities said. The man had gone hiking in the Marathokampou area of the island, the Hellenic Rescue Team of Samos said in a post on Facebook on Wednesday. Local residents are helping with the search, it added.

Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\u00a0plundered the facility on Saturday stealing an ambulance among other supplies, the aid agency said. \u201cOn Saturday, MSF and the Ministry of Health suspended all activities in South Hospital, El Fasher, North Darfur, after RSF soldiers stormed the facility, opened fire, and looted it, including stealing an MSF ambulance,\u201d MSF Sudan said on social media Saturday. The hospital was the only one in the region \u201cequipped to deal with mass casualties\u201d and \u201cwas the main referral hospital for treating war-wounded.\u201d It was also one of the two hospitals in El Fasher with surgical capacity, according to MSF. As a result, patients are being moved to Paediatric and Saudi hospitals \u201cwhich were unprepared for such an influx,\u201d it added. Video posted on an apparent RSF \u201cX\u201d account shows armed men at the front gate of South Hospital. The footage was geolocated by CNN and shows at least one man firing an AK-style weapon on hospital grounds. According to MSF\u2019s statement posted on Twitter,\u00a0only ten patients and a small medical team were at the hospital\u00a0when it was attacked. Medical teams had already begun transferring patients and services to other facilities earlier in the week after intensified fighting in the region, the MSF said. Images posted to social media and verified by CNN show damaged medical equipment strewn in and around the facility. In one video, an armed man poses inside what appears to be an ambulance parked outside South Hospital. It is unclear whether the vehicle belonged to MSF. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment. MSF said most patients and the remaining medical team, which included all MSF staff, were able to flee the violence but they are unable to say for certain if there were any casualties due to the chaos that ensued. South Hospital is the latest medical facility to fall into warring factions\u2019 crosshairs in Darfur. The medical facility had already been hit by mortar shells and bullets multiple times in the preceding weeks between May 25th\u00a0and June 3rd\u00a0resulting in two deaths and 14 injuries among patients and caretakers, according to MSF. On May 11, nearby Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital was impacted by an SAF airstrike 50 meters from the facility, per an MSF press release. Two children and a care giver in the intensive care unit were killed in the strike after a roof collapsed. \u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\u201d said MSF\u2019s Head of Emergencies Michel Lacharite, as quoted by MSF Sudan on X Saturday. \u201cWarring parties must halt attacks on medical care. Hospitals are closing. Remaining facilities can\u2019t handle mass casualties. We are trying to find solutions. The responsibility is on warring parties to spare medical facilities,\u201d Lacharite added. Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy of the EU Nabila Massrali\u00a0said on X Sunday,\u00a0\u201cThe EU is appalled by RSF-Janjaweed assault of staff at the El Fasher South Hospital in Darfur also looting it, as it did with many other hospitals in Sudan.\u201d \u201cWe remind again the [RSF] to show restraint and respect International Humanitarian Law,\u201d she added.

Civil war in Sudan between the SAF and RSF broke out in April 2023. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since the war\u2019s outbreak more than 8.8 million people have fled their homes and 24.8 million people are in need of assistance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/africa/sudans-al-fashir-main-hospital-shut-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

In an AI category at the 1839 Awards\u2019 Color Photography Contest, judged by industry leaders at Christie\u2019s, Phaidon and the Centre Pompidou, Astray pulled off an act of feathery subterfuge, sneaking in an entry of a real photo of a flamingo he took while in Aruba. Like AI images, which can bear hallmark signs of wonky anatomy, like too many teeth or fingers, the flamingo appeared headless as it bent its neck to scratch itself with its beak. To Astray\u2019s surprise, it won both third place in the category \u2014 and the People\u2019s Vote award. \u201cTo see it get shortlisted by the jury was a surprise in that it\u2019s always a bit of a lottery in such big contest. There are just so many excellent pictures competing,\u201d Astray told CNN over email. \u201cAfter it got shortlisted\u2026 I thought I might really have a shot and started campaigning for people\u2019s votes, but I had absolutely no idea how far or close I was to winning until the announcement.\u201d After the winners were revealed, the photographer notified the organization that runs the 1839 Awards, Creative Resource Collective, and took to social media to reveal his trickery. \u201cI entered this actual photo into the AI category of 1839 Awards to prove that human-made content has not lost its relevance, that Mother Nature and her human interpreters can still beat the machine, and that creativity and emotion are more than just a string of digits,\u201d Astray wrote. \u201cThere were ethical concerns, of course, so I was hoping that the jury and the audience would find that this jab at AI and its ethical implications outweighs the ethical implications of deceiving the viewer, which, of course, is ironic because that is what AI does.\u201d Astray was subsequently disqualified from the competition, with the director of Creative Resource Collective, Lily Fierman, explaining in a statement to CNN that \u201ceach category has distinct criteria that entrants\u2019 images must meet\u2026 we don\u2019t want to prevent other artists from their shot at winning in the AI category.\u201d Fierman said there\u2019s \u201cno hard feelings,\u201d and that their team plans to work with Astray to publish a conversation around the state of AI-generated images, using his entry as a \u201cjumping-off point.\u201d \u201cWe hope this will raise awareness (and send a message of hope) to other photographers who are worried about AI,\u201d she added. Creative Resource Collective did not comment on how their AI and non-AI photography categories are judged and vetted. As for the flamingo, Astray emphasized it was a serendipitous moment, not one that he sought out. \u201cI was not actively looking for a picture that would work for this stunt,\u201d he explained to CNN. \u201cRather, the idea had been roaming in some remote corner of my mind, more subconsciously than consciously I think, and when I saw this picture, it surfaced. It is simply the perfect shot for this because the scene is so unreal and for such a simple, natural reason: a flamingo scratching its belly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/style/flamingo-photograph-ai-1839-awards/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_weather_heat-dome-summer-hurricane-climate", "text": "Summer technically starts next week and will show the US what it\u2019s capable of\u00a0in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution and without El Ni\u00f1o. Prolonged, record-breaking heat is on the way for an area of the country that has largely avoided it so far, wildfire risks are rising in parts of the West and bathtub-warm water could fuel the first tropical depression of the Atlantic hurricane season. Heat dome to bring intense heat wave for millions Heat arrived in the eastern half of the country Friday, but it\u2019s just an appetizer of what\u2019s to come. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome builds Sunday over the East and expands to reach the Midwest and Great Lakes over the following days, ushering in the regions\u2019 first significant heat wave of the year. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. This one will make temperatures skyrocket to levels hotter than even the hottest typical summer day. Hundreds of temperature records could fall by the end of next week, both during the day and at night. Temperatures will top out 15 to 20 degrees above normal over a huge portion of the eastern half of the country Monday afternoon, but surge even higher to reach 25 degrees above normal at times from Tuesday through Friday. This translates to days of high temperatures well into the 90s for tens of millions of people who don\u2019t typically bake in long-lasting heat. Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, which is another symptom of a warming world. Overnight low temperatures aren\u2019t expected to drop below the low 70s or upper 60s in many locations. To make matters worse, humidity will work in tandem with extreme heat to send the heat index \u2013 how heat feels to the human body \u2013 to dangerous triple digits in parts of the East. Heat index values in the low 100s are possible as far north as Maine next week. The health risks from heat will reach extreme levels for millions next week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and CDC. Heat is the deadliest form of weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. First signs of tropical trouble are brewing The Atlantic hurricane season looks ready to awaken at the same time intense summer heat bakes a significant portion of the country. There are two short-term risk areas that could produce the first tropical system of the year, and both are a little too close to the US coast for comfort. An area in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico has the highest chance to become the first tropical system. There is also a small window and a low chance the same stormy pattern driving Florida\u2019s rain could develop into a tropical depression off the Southeast coast before it gets swept out to sea this weekend. Robust tropical moisture is swirling in the southwestern Gulf because of the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters. The gyre\u2019s broad spin and abundant moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific Ocean when other necessary factors \u2013 including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water \u2013 align. That could be the case by midweek; the National Hurricane Center says there\u2019s a medium chance a tropical depression could form in the Bay of Campeche in the southwestern Gulf. Most of the Gulf of Mexico is bathtub-warm, so if a tropical system manages to form it would have plenty of fuel to strengthen. If something does form, it\u2019s likely to track north or northwest. Regardless of tropical development, a surge of moisture like the one behind the deluges in South Florida will provide much-needed wet weather to parts of Mexico that have been baking under extreme heat and brutal drought for weeks. But it will also raise the flood risk along the Gulf Coast, especially in areas soaked this spring. Multiple days of rain are heading for the Gulf Coast from Texas to Alabama starting Sunday and continuing throughout the week. Wildfire risk growing Heat isn\u2019t just making us sweat and giving hurricane season a boost \u2013 it\u2019s also had a hand in several recent notable wildfires. Fire activity is increasing gradually nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Almost a dozen large fires are burning in parts of the West and half of these started in recent days. Hot, dry conditions in place since early in the month in the West will continue to increase wildfire risk and could worsen ongoing fires. Wildfire fuels like grass and plant life will continue to dry out during this time, making them more prone to fire ignition or spread. Winds will also kick up in the region later this weekend and early next week. Gusty winds cause wildfires to spread quickly, as the Corral Fire demonstrated in California at the start of June. Breezy conditions could also spell trouble next week for a small, but destructive fire in Arizona, about 70 miles northwest of Phoenix, dubbed the Rose Fire. The fire destroyed at least 15 structures \u2013 seven of which were homes \u2013 along with at least a dozen vehicles, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said Thursday. The fire had burned through at least 166 acres since igniting Wednesday, but was only 20% contained as of Thursday evening.

{"id": "2024_06_09_europe_analysis-european-parliament-far-right-intl-latam", "text": "Europe\u2019s drift to the right has been a long journey that\u2019s seen the continent\u2019s mainstream increasingly accommodate people with Euroskeptic views that were once fringe. The\u00a0projected gains for the hard\u00a0right in the European\u00a0parliamentary elections may seem modest in terms of pure\u00a0numbers,\u00a0but\u00a0they are significant. The results\u00a0represent a major challenge to the pro-Europe mainstream officials who dominate the institutions\u00a0of the European Union. The advances chalked up by far-right parties may not be unexpected, and they don\u2019t pose an existential crisis for the EU. But they\u00a0show how the Euroskeptic right could, in the coming years, tighten\u00a0its\u00a0grip on the direction\u00a0of the union. Over the next 24 hours,\u00a0the parties of the center \u2013\u00a0projected to remain the largest bloc in the European Parliament \u2013\u00a0will likely talk of a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d to counter the rise of the far right.\u00a0And while the far right is on course to make large gains, the center parties remain ahead. On paper, these pro-EU parties can claim victory. On numbers alone, the centrist coalition has held. The center-right European People\u2019s Party, the center-left Socialists and Democrats, and the liberal Renew Europe are the three largest groups in the European Parliament. When you throw the pro-Europe Greens into that, the center is by far the largest block. Even when you take into consideration gains for the hard-right European Conservative Reformers and Identity and Democracy, it still leaves the mainstream, pro-Europe center with a healthy majority in parliament. The\u00a0course\u00a0of European politics, however,\u00a0is not necessarily set inside the European Parliament and it\u2019s not clear that the centrist bloc would even want to work together. While these centrist groups are all pro-EU, they differ on all manner of policies. For those on the center right, domestic political shifts to the hard right could make working with the hard right increasingly attractive at a European level. This might create difficulties in appointing the next European Commission \u2013\u00a0the executive branch of the EU \u2013 which sets the political direction of the bloc. The deadline for this is months away, which leaves a lot of time for horse-trading, which could see elements of the center right and hard right cooperate. The same dynamic could play out when the parliament comes to vote on policy. Coalitions are not formal in the EU Parliament, rather, lawmakers vote on an issue-by-issue basis. It\u2019s not implausible that the center right could vote with the left on issues like support for Ukraine, but then work with the hard right on immigration and climate policy. It\u2019s not just politics at the European level that will affect how these groups might work together in Brussels. The domestic politics back in member states will inevitably put pressure on how those elected to the European Parliament cooperate with their colleagues. Of the 27 EU member states, 13 heads of government currently belong to European parties on the\u00a0right. A new government is due to form in the\u00a0Netherlands, which could be led by a member of ID. There are other European leaders who are not a member of any European party, but are broadly sympathetic to ideas from the right. French President Emmanuel Macron has responded to\u00a0the\u00a0projected crushing loss to\u00a0his far-right\u00a0rival\u00a0Marine Le Pen\u00a0by dissolving parliament and\u00a0calling\u00a0elections later this month. Le Pen has already forced Macron to move a long way to the right in France,\u00a0with his\u00a0government\u00a0taking\u00a0on increasingly anti-immigrant and anti-Islam rhetoric. In 2027, France will hold a\u00a0presidential\u00a0election which\u00a0could sweep\u00a0Le Pen\u00a0to\u00a0power. Sunday\u2019s results\u00a0do not\u00a0show\u00a0a dramatic or sudden shift to the right, but something more nuanced and gradual\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that the center\u00a0ground of European politics has\u00a0been shifting rightward\u00a0over a number of years. The most visible recent example of this has been the emergence of Giorgia Meloni as a major player in EU politics. In 2022, she was elected as\u00a0prime\u00a0minister\u00a0of Italy. Her domestic party, Brothers of Italy, is the most\u00a0rightwing\u00a0to be elected to government\u00a0there\u00a0since that of Benito Mussolini, the\u00a0wartime\u00a0fascist leader. Initially, Brussels officials feared that Meloni would be a firebrand out to destroy the EU. In office, she has been an ally of\u00a0Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and has worked cooperatively with her counterparts on issues like Ukraine. She has used the influence she\u2019s gained to shift the EU\u2019s policy positions on issues that matter to her: most notably, migration. The\u00a0high\u00a0point\u00a0of\u00a0Euroskepticism\u00a0for most casual observers was probably the Brexit vote in 2016. That was the result of years of domestic politics shifting in the UK, the\u00a0center\u00a0right\u00a0shifting to fend off the\u00a0hard\u00a0right,\u00a0ultimately leading to that rupture. The difference between what happened in the UK and what is happening now is that Euroskeptics no longer want to leave the EU: they want to take it over. Placing these provisional results in that context as we look ahead to more elections across the continent in the coming months and years, that takeover of the EU\u2019s center looks increasingly more realistic. European elections are rarely about the EU itself; they are 27 national elections taking place in the political context of those countries. They are often used as protest votes, where groups who would not be elected to positions of power domestically do well because voters know they will not actually be running anything. What these results do reveal, however, is that the subtle shift to the right, dragging the center along with it, is still happening across Europe.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/europe/analysis-european-parliament-far-right-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_tech_spacex-elon-musk-former-employees-lawsuit", "text": "SpaceX and CEO Elon Musk were sued on Wednesday by former employees who claim they were illegally fired for raising concerns about gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the rocket company. The lawsuit, brought by eight employees who were fired in 2022, alleges that Musk wants to be \u201cthe leader to a brave new world of space travel, but runs his company in the dark ages \u2014 treating women as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size, bombarding the workplace with lewd sexual banter, and offering the reprise to those who challenge the \u2018Animal House\u2019 environment that if they don\u2019t like it they can seek employment elsewhere,\u201d according to the complaint, filed in state court in California. The eight former employees were involved in writing a 2022 open letter criticizing Musk and urging SpaceX executives to make the firm\u2019s culture more inclusive. The letter, which was signed by at least 400 other employees, asked SpaceX management to make it clear that Musk\u2019s statements \u2014 particularly on Twitter \u2014 did not reflect the views or values of the company and asserted that SpaceX\u2019s so-called \u201cNo A**hole\u201d policy was unevenly enforced. Following the letter\u2019s release, the eight employees were fired. Wednesday\u2019s complaint alleges that \u201cMusk personally ordered the Plaintiff\u2019s terminations.\u201d SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. SpaceX does not typically respond to queries from news organizations. In response to the 2022 letter, SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell previously said she would enforce SpaceX\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d standards against employee harassment, but the The New York Times reported that she said the employees had been fired for making other staff feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d SpaceX previously faced similar complaints filed to the National Labor Relations Board over the termination of employees involved in the letter. Those complaints claimed that the terminations amounted to employees being fired for engaging in \u201cconcerted protected activities.\u201d One former employee who filed an NLRB complaint and is a plaintiff in the Wednesday lawsuit, Tom Moline, previously told CNN that SpaceX management used an \u201c\u2018ends justifies the means\u2019 philosophy to turn a blind eye to the ongoing mistreatment, harassment, and abuse reported by my colleagues, much of which was directly encouraged and inspired by the words and actions of the CEO.\u201d Earlier this year, SpaceX responded to a consolidated complaint from the NLRB with its own lawsuit, alleging that the structure of the NLRB itself is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint details the statements by Musk and the actions of other workers that the fired employees claim contributed to a hostile work environment and \u201cpervasively sexist culture\u201d at SpaceX. It points to multiple crude posts by Musk on Twitter, now called X, such as one containing a plan \u201cto create a Texas university similar to MIT which he would call \u2018TITS\u2019 and where \u2018Ds [women\u2019s bra size] would get degrees,\u2019 accompanied by an altered photo rendering a rocket to appear to be a giant penis,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThings like that were widely shared on all internal chat channels and talked about in meetings and used as fodder in professional environments,\u201d Paige\u00a0Holland-Thielen, one of the plaintiffs, told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates, adding that employees were \u201cencouraged\u201d to follow Musk on the social media platform. As a result, it became \u201cimpossible to separate his personal nonsense from the actual day-to-day life of an actual working environment,\u201d she said. The complaint also references a post from Musk, shared the day after Business Insider published a report claiming Musk had sexually harassed a flight attendant, in which the billionaire said: \u201cFinally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It\u2019s kinda perfect,\u201d along with a laughing emoji. (Musk has\u00a0denied\u00a0the harassment claims.) \u201cMusk\u2019s conduct of interjecting this juvenile, grotesque sexual banter into the workplace had the wholly foreseeable and intentional result of encouraging other employees to engage in similar conduct,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint states. The former employees allege that engineers commonly applied \u201ccrude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name \u2018Upskirt Camera\u2019 was used for a camera on first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage,\u201d according to the complaint. In one instance, a SpaceX HR director responded to allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior at an internal event by saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never been sexually harassed; I must not be hot enough,\u201d the complaint alleges. The lawsuit adds that the former employees believe \u201cSpaceX has not taken action to redress the harassment, hostile work-environment, and retaliation.\u201d The former employees are seeking unspecified monetary damages to account for \u201clost wages, earnings, and other employee benefits, emotional distress.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details and context.

{"id": "2024_06_09_europe_european-parliament-far-right-surge-intl", "text": "Far-right parties are predicted to win a record number of seats in the European Parliament, a result that, if confirmed, would deliver a stinging rebuke to Brussels\u2019 political mainstream and add uncertainty to Europe\u2019s future direction. After three days of voting across the European Union\u2019s 27 member states, an exit poll showed that far-right parties were set to win around 150 of the parliament\u2019s 720 seats, which will likely make it harder for mainstream parties to form majorities needed to pass laws. In a speech late Sunday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the results showed her European People\u2019s Party (EPP) \u2013 predicted to secure the most seats \u2013 could still act as an \u201canchor of stability,\u201d but called on her political allies to help guard against extremist parties. \u201cThe center is holding. But it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right have gained support, and this is why the result comes with great responsibility for the parties in the center,\u201d she told an audience in Brussels. The full results will trickle in on Monday, when the process of coalition-building will begin as Europe\u2019s centrists seek to put aside their differences to see off a resurgent far right. Most of the far-right gains were concentrated in countries that elect large numbers of seats: France, Italy and Germany. After an exit poll showed Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party is expected to trounce his own candidates, French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his parliament and called a risky snap election, with the first round on June 30. RN won 36.8% of the vote, according to official results from the French Interior Ministry on Monday, followed by Macron\u2019s pro-European list on 14.6% and the center-left Socialist Party with 13.8%. In a celebratory speech at the RN headquarters before Macron\u2019s shock announcement, party leader Jordan Bardella said the \u201cunprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era.\u201d Like Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also suffered a stinging blow in the exit poll, as his Social Democrats (SD) scored their worst-ever result of 14%, while the mainstream Christian Democrats Party (CDU) came top with 29.5% of the vote and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came second with 16.5%. While the results will shape the political direction of the EU for the next five years, this cluster of national elections is often seen as a de facto referendum on the incumbent domestic governments, which could spell trouble for Macron in France\u2019s 2027 presidential election and for Scholz in Germany\u2019s federal elections next year. A lot has changed in Europe since the last parliamentary elections in 2019, after Britain left the bloc in 2020 and Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, putting much of the continent on a war footing as it sought to send desperately needed supplies to Kyiv and member states shored up their own defenses. \u201cOf course, this election does not take place in a vacuum. The world around us is in turmoil. Forces from the outside and from the inside are trying to destabilize our societies, and they are trying to weaken Europe,\u201d von der Leyen said. While the far-right surge may further complicate Brussels\u2019 bid for unity, the far-right parties themselves remain relatively divided. The AfD is politically homeless: it was removed from the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) party after its main European candidate, Maximilian Krah, said he did not consider all members of the Nazi group the SS to be criminals. Several other far-right parties are among the non-aligned (NI) group, predicted to secure 45 seats. Responding to the exit poll, Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, said the results showed Brussels\u2019 political establishment needed to \u201cunderstand how people voted\u201d and take decisions \u201cthat have an impact on citizens\u2019 daily lives.\u201d \u201cWe can see that the constructive, pro-European center has held,\u201d she said, but stressed there remains \u201ca responsibility of the groups to come together to form a majority.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/europe/european-parliament-far-right-surge-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_middleeast_hamas-interview-israel-gaza-hostages-intl", "text": "The fate of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza is crucial to any deal to end the protracted and bloody conflict between Israel and Hamas. But a senior Hamas official has told CNN that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many of them are alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of\u00a0a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Hamas spokesperson and political bureau member Osama Hamdan offered an insight into the militant group\u2019s position on the stalled ceasefire talks, a view on whether Hamas regrets its decision to attack Israel given the mounting Palestinian death toll, and a commentary on the leak earlier this week of messages from its chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, the man believed to be the ultimate decision-maker on any peace deal. The US believes that Hamas holds the key to the talks. \u201cThe haggling has to stop,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NBC on Thursday, urging Sinwar to end the war. \u201cHe\u2019s relatively safe underground; the people that he purports to represent, they\u2019re suffering every day.\u201d Speaking to CNN in the Lebanese capital Beirut, Hamdan said the latest proposal on the table \u2013 an Israeli plan that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden late last month \u2013 did not meet the group\u2019s demands for an end to the war. Hamdan, who has been part of the Hamas negotiations team on the ground, told CNN that the group needed \u201ca clear position from Israel to accept the ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from Gaza, and let the Palestinians to determine their future by themselves, the reconstruction, the (lifting) of the siege \u2026 and we are ready to talk about a fair deal about the prisoners exchange.\u201d Negotiations over the US-backed proposal have intensified in recent days but appeared to grind to a halt on Wednesday after Hamas presented its response to the document, 12 days after first receiving it. Blinken expressed frustration over what he said was Hamas\u2019s decision to submit \u201cnumerous changes,\u201d describing some of them as going \u201cbeyond positions (Hamas) had previously taken.\u201d \u201cSome of the changes are workable. Some are not,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Doha on Wednesday. The US-backed ceasefire plan that was approved by the United Nations Security Council on Monday lays out a phased approach. In the first phase, there would be a six-week ceasefire in which some hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and the Israeli military would pull out of populated areas in Gaza. The second phase \u2013 a permanent end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2013 would only be implemented after further negotiations between the two sides. But Hamdan told CNN the duration of the ceasefire was a key issue for Hamas, which is concerned that Israel has no intention of following through with the second phase of the deal. The end of hostilities must be permanent, he said, and Israel must withdraw from Gaza completely. \u201cThe Israelis want the ceasefire only for six weeks and then they want to go back to the fight, which I think the Americans, till now, they did not convince the Israelis to accept (a\u00a0permanent ceasefire),\u201d he said, adding that he believes the US needs to convince Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire as part of the deal. Israel has not yet publicly committed to the deal, even though the White House has repeatedly stressed that it was an Israeli plan that the government had accepted. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been under pressure to announce his support for the current plan, has repeatedly said that the war will not end until Israel eliminates Hamas. Blinken told NBC that Netanyahu \u201creconfirmed\u201d to him \u201cthat Israel supported this proposal and was ready to say yes\u201d when he saw him couple of days ago, and placed the blame for stalled negotiations squarely on Hamas. \u201cHamas has to demonstrate that it too wants this to end. If it does, we can bring it to an end. If it doesn\u2019t, then it means that it wants the war to continue,\u201d Blinken said. Question of responsibility Speaking to CNN inside a modest office decorated with a large map of Gaza and panoramic photo of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Hamdan repeatedly deflected any questions about Hamas\u2019 role in the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. He called the October 7 terror attacks, which sparked the current war in Gaza, \u201ca reaction against the occupation.\u201d The October 7 attack was the deadliest assault in Israel\u2019s history. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and also took some 250 people hostage into Gaza. Israel was quick to retaliate, immediately declaring war on Hamas and launching an intense campaign of bombardment followed by a ground invasion several weeks later. That operation has had a devastating impact on the Palestinians of Gaza. More than 37,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the strip. Some 90% of people living in the territory are estimated to have been displaced by the fighting. While the Gazan authorities do not distinguish between casualties among civilians and Hamas fighters, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has previously admitted the majority of those killed in the operation were civilians. Asked repeatedly by CNN whether Hamas regretted its decision to attack Israel, Hamdan responded by blaming the situation on Israel and saying the attack was \u201ca reaction against the occupation.\u201d \u201cThe one who is in charge or responsible for that is (the Israeli) occupation. If you resist the occupation, (they) will kill you, if you did not resist the occupation, (they) also will kill you and deport you out of your country. So what we are supposed to do, just to wait?,\u201d he said. Hamdan also dismissed as fake reports that Sinwar suggested the deaths of thousands of Palestinians were \u201cnecessary sacrifices.\u201d Sinwar has not been seen in public since the October 7 attacks. He is believed to be hiding in Gaza, somewhere inside the tunnel network that runs underneath the strip. He has been designated as a terrorist by the US, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians in Gaza as human shields and earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal published what it said were leaked messages from Sinwar to other Hamas leaders in which he allegedly expressed an uncompromising determination to continue fighting, regardless of the human cost. Hamdan told CNN the messages \u201cwere fake.\u201d \u201cIt was fake messages done by someone who is not Palestinian and (it) was sent (to the) Wall Street Journal as part of the pressure against Hamas and provoking the people against the leader,\u201d he said without providing evidence. \u201cNo one can accept the killing of the Palestinians, of his own people.\u201d Destroying Hamas? When Israel launched its war on Hamas, Netanyahu said the objectives were to \u201cdestroy Hamas and bring back hostages held in Gaza.\u201d But more than eight months on, the goal of eliminating the group completely appears unachievable. While the IDF has killed some Hamas commanders, the top leadership in Gaza, including Sinwar, continues to evade them. And despite the damage caused to its infrastructure, Hamas also continues to fire rockets towards Israel, albeit much more sporadically than at the outset of the conflict. American intelligence officials believe that Sinwar likely believes Hamas can survive Israel\u2019s attempt to destroy it. At the same time, Netanyahu is under increasing pressure to reach a deal that would secure the return of the remaining hostages still in Gaza. Israel believes that more than 70 hostages of the more than 100 who are still held in Gaza to be alive. Speaking to CNN, Hamdan said he didn\u2019t know how many were still alive. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea about that. No one has an idea about this,\u201d he said, alleging \u2013 without providing any evidence \u2013 that the Israeli operation to free four of the hostages on Saturday resulted in the deaths of three others, including an American citizen. There are fears that more hostages may be dead than are publicly known. In April, Hamas told international mediators that it was not able to fulfill Israel\u2019s demand to free 40 of the remaining hostages in the first phase of a deal, including all the women as well as sick and elderly men, because it did not hold 40 living hostages who match those criteria for release. Opposition leader Benny Gantz, who quit the Israeli war cabinet last weekend, was asked by an Israeli TV channel on Thursday whether Israel knew how many hostages are alive. He responded by saying: \u201cWe know (a) very close number,\u201d he responded. Asked about the testimony of a doctor who treated the released hostages and said they suffered mental and physical abuse and were beaten every hour, Hamdan again blamed Israel for their suffering. \u201cI believe if they have mental problem, this is because of what Israel have done in Gaza. Because (no one can) handle what Israel is doing, bombing each day, killing civilians, killing women and children \u2026 they saw that (with) their own eyes,\u201d he said, adding that comparing images of the hostages taken before and after the eight-months long captivity shows \u201cthey were better than before\u201d \u2013 a claim that is demonstrably false.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/middleeast/hamas-interview-israel-gaza-hostages-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Instead, they found themselves trapped inside a grounded plane for more than three hours, according to passenger Garth Collins, who posted about his experience on Instagram. Not only that, but the passengers were stuck inside the closed metal vessel without air conditioning, Collins said, as temperatures outside soared above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), leading to passengers \u201cliterally dehydrating and passing out on the plane.\u201d Greece has been gripped by a blistering heatwave in the past week, causing popular tourist sites like the Acropolis to be closed to the public. British television personality Michael Mosley was found dead on the Greek island of Symi after he went for a walk in high temperatures last Wednesday. This week, two other tourists also disappeared on separate hikes elsewhere in the country, authorities have said. In a video posted by Collins, passengers can be seen standing up from their seats and in the aisles of the plane, fanning themselves and fellow passengers with paper. CNN has reached out to Collins for further comment. Athens International Airport told CNN that the flight was grounded while ready for departure due to \u201csudden unexpected technical issues.\u201d Qatar Airways said it \u201csincerely apologizes for the delay to passengers travelling on flight QR204 from Athens (ATH) to Doha (DOH) on Monday 10 June 2024, which was due to a technical issue,\u201d in a statement shared with CNN. Australian passenger Jennie Zeiher was onboard the plane with her husband Joe, planning to fly on from Doha to Melbourne, Australia. Speaking to CNN affiliate 7News after she arrived in Melbourne, Zeiher said she didn\u2019t understand why the passengers were allowed to board. \u2018I\u2019m a frequent flyer, I travel regularly, and I just don\u2019t understand why we were allowed to board in the first place,\u201d Zeiher said, according to 7News. \u201cNot to mention what unfolded afterwards. It was just horrendous.\u201d 7News reports that passengers took their shirts off to deal with the heat, with a few cups of water being handed out in the cabin. \u201cThe flight attendants were doing the best they could given the situation,\u201d Zeiher told 7News, adding that \u201cit seemed like they didn\u2019t know any more than we did about what was going on.\u201d Eventually, the passengers disembarked the plane. Collins says he was on the plane for around three and a half hours, while Zeiher said she was onboard for around four. Zeiher told 7News that she received \u201czero information\u201d from Qatar Airways, so she decided to rebook her onward flight to Australia through Emirates. According to flight tracking website Flightradar24, flight QR204 was supposed to leave Athens International Airport at 1:55 p.m. local time. It eventually departed at 6:44 a.m. the following morning, landing at Doha\u2019s Hamad International\u00a0Airport at 10:35 a.m. local time.

Authorities identified the suspect only by his last name, Cui, who was describes as a 55-year-old man from the city\u2019s Longtan District. Police said he \u201ccollided with a foreigner while walking\u201d in Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in the city center. The suspect then stabbed the instructors, as well as a Chinese tourist who stepped forward and tried to stop him during the incident, police said in a statement. Police said they received the call around 11:49 a.m. local time Monday, after which they dispatched officers to the scene and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. The injured \u201chave all received proper medical treatment and are not in danger \u2026\u201d police said earlier. The educators from Cornell College, a private liberal arts college\u00a0in Mount Vernon, Iowa, were wounded \u201cin a serious incident\u201d\u00a0on Monday, while participating in a partnership program with Beihua University in Jilin, according to the college. \u201cWe have been in contact with all four instructors and are assisting them during this time,\u201d Cornell College President Jonathan Brand said in a statement, adding no students took part in the program. Footage purportedly showing the aftermath of the daylight attack emerged on Chinese social media on Monday but was swiftly censored. It showed two men and a woman lying on the ground covered in large blood stains, surrounded by onlookers. They appeared conscious and were talking on their cell phones, the video showed. CNN geolocated the video to Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in Jilin city center, less than half an hour\u2019s drive from Beihua University. Monday was a public holiday in China. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that \u201cfour foreign teachers at Beihua University were attacked\u201d while visiting the park Monday morning \u2013 adding they were immediately taken to the hospital and did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner told CNN his brother, David Zabner, was one of the victims of the stabbing. Zabner said his brother, who was on his second visit to China with Cornell, is \u201cdoing well\u201d and has \u201cbeen stitched up and seems to be recovering,\u201d after speaking to him on Tuesday morning Beijing time. The other three victims survived the attack, Adam Zabner said, adding he could not comment on their health status. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely grateful that my brother is OK and that he survived this attack,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe hope of my family is to get my brother back home as soon as possible and get them healthy. And we really just want to thank the US State Department for all their help, and also our federal delegation from Iowa who have been particularly helpful.\u201d The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing incident in China and is monitoring the situation. \u2018Horrifying attack\u2019 Knife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled. The country has faced a spate of stabbing rampages in public places including schools and hospitals. But public attacks against foreigners are rare. The attack in Jilin comes as China has been seeking to draw back international visitors following three years of stringent Covid-19 border controls. It also comes amid efforts to boost educational exchanges with the United States as the two countries look to stabilize their fraught relationship. The incident has drawn attention and concern in Iowa from officials and lawmakers. Gov. Kim Reynolds called it a \u201chorrifying attack.\u201d US Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents the district where Cornell College is located, said the college employees \u201cwere brutally stabbed\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in our power to bring these Iowans home safely.\u201d On China\u2019s heavily censored social media, visuals and discussions about the attack had been swiftly erased since Monday. Censorship appeared to have relaxed somewhat by noon Tuesday to allow some comments to surface. Some Chinese internet users called it a \u201cterrible\u201d incident, while others questioned why Chinese media was not reporting on the attack. Some also expressed concerns about its potential impact on China\u2019s global image and the willingness of foreigners to visit the country, amid a rise in nationalism and anti-American sentiment. At its news conference Tuesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry sought to dismiss concerns that the attack would affect educational exchanges between China and the US. \u201cCarrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States is in the common interests of both sides and has received active support and response from various sectors in both countries,\u201d said Lin, the spokesperson. \u201cChina is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China has always taken effective measures and will continue to take relevant measures to effectively protect the safety of all foreigners in China.\u201d Study ties Cornell College began a partnership with Beihua University in 2018, which would see the Chinese institution provide funding for educators from the Iowa school to travel and live in China and teach a portion of a course in areas of computer science, math and physics over two-week periods, according to information posted on the college website at the time. China has been trying to boost its educational cooperation with the US, which has suffered considerable setbacks due to the Covid pandemic and bilateral tensions. During a visit to the US in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the country would invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years to foster personal ties between the two countries. The Chinese leader noted his own enduring ties to the state of Iowa in his announcement. Xi stayed with a host family in Iowa during his first visit to the US nearly four decades ago, an experience he has described as \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Last week, Xi encouraged universities in China and the US to \u201cstrengthen exchanges and cooperation,\u201d in a letter to the president of Kean University in New Jersey, which has a China-based joint venture with Wenzhou University, according to state media. China has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world, partly due to its strict gun controls and powerful mass surveillance. But it has continued to face mass stabbings in public places. In May, two people were killed and another 21 injured in a knife attack in a hospital in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning\u00a0stabbing incident\u00a0outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province.

Daily high temperatures will surge up to 15 degrees above what\u2019s typical for June through at least Saturday and threaten dozens of daily high temperature records as sweltering heat in place over the West expands east. And the heat isn\u2019t dropping by for a quick visit, even if it ebbs in some places. There are signs it\u2019ll stick around for the long haul as a predicted hot summer kicks into gear. Parts of the West have been baking since a stifling heat dome set up over the region last week. One person died on Monday while hiking in Colorado National Monument Park in western Colorado, according to a news release from the National Park Service. Temperatures were around 90 degrees. Now, some of that heat and an additional push of hot air from Mexico are enveloping more of the US as the jet stream \u2013 a river of fast-moving air in the upper atmosphere that separates warm air from cold air \u2013\u00a0slowly shifts north over the central and eastern states. Heat will ramp up Thursday from the Plains to the East Coast, marking a considerable change from seasonably cool conditions earlier in the week. Highs in the upper 80s and 90s will be common from the Plains and Midwest to the Southeast, Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic. Several cities will experience the warmest day of the year so far Thursday, but temperatures will be short of record levels. Humidity will build alongside the heat and make conditions feel even more uncomfortable. The thermometer has yet to climb out of the low 90s in St. Louis this year, but that will change Thursday with a high around 96 degrees. The heat index \u2013 how air feels to the human body \u2013 could approach triple digits. Temperatures will warm even more Friday for much of the Gulf Coast, Southeast and mid-Atlantic as hot air surges north. Highs well into the 90s will stretch from Texas through Georgia and the Carolinas north into parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Friday will be the hottest day of the year so far in Washington, DC. The high temperature could approach the mid-90s, which is about 10 degrees higher than normal. Heat will be at its worst by Saturday for much of the Gulf Coast and Southeast but ease slightly for areas farther north with the passage of a cold front. Atlanta is expected to top out near 99 degrees on Saturday, which would be a temperature record for the date and the hottest reading of the year so far. If the city were to hit 100 degrees it would be the first triple-digit temperature there since August 2019. Highs in the upper 90s and low 100s could also break Saturday\u2019s high temperature records in multiple other Southeast cities including: Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Expansive heat will build once again for much of the central and eastern US on Sunday as the jet stream settles near the US-Canada border and high pressure builds in the upper atmosphere. Anyone hoping for relief is out of luck.

Hamas said\u00a0in a statement\u00a0Wednesday it \u201chas shown the necessary positivity in all stages of negotiations\u201d\u00a0to reach a \u201ccomprehensive and acceptable agreement based on the just demands of our people.\u201d The statement comes after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioned whether the Palestinian militant group is \u201cproceeding in good faith\u201d in the ceasefire negotiations, saying Hamas had proposed a number of changes in their response to the latest deal, which \u201cgo beyond positions they had previously taken.\u201d On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Rafah said it had received information from Israeli authorities that fighting will continue in western Rafah. CNN video showed many Palestinians taking down shelters and packing up their belongings after warnings spread of a pending military operation. An estimated 550,000 people are now in Al-Mawasi, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from Oxfam, after the IDF ordered people in eastern Rafah to head to the \u201cexpanded humanitarian area\u201d as it stepped up its operations in southern Gaza. Currently just 121 toilets have been installed in the densely packed tent city, according to Oxfam, meaning every toilet is shared by more than 4,000 people. The Al-Mawasi camp was already filled with displaced people before civilians in Rafah were ordered to move there. The United Nations has called facilities in the area unsuitable for the hundreds of thousands of Gazans uprooted by violence in Rafah and across the Gaza Strip. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah to the nearby areas of Al-Mawasi, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis in recent weeks, according to Oxfam. Some 1.7 million people, more than two thirds of Gaza\u2019s population, are now estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers (27 square miles) \u2014 less than a fifth of the strip. The reports of strikes on Thursday follow an operation by Israel to rescue hostages held by Hamas over the weekend. The Israeli military rescued four hostages in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, an operation that Gazan authorities said killed 274 people and injured almost 700 others. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures. Gaza\u2019s health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants.

{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_russia-evan-gershkovich-court-trial-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, will stand trial in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg after prosecutors formally accused him of spying for the CIA. The Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s office said Thursday it had approved the indictment, more than a year after Gershkovich was first detained. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Gershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have vehemently denied the charges against him. Less than two weeks after his arrest, Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, which called for his immediate release. Russian prosecutors said the country\u2019s federal security service (FSB) had \u201cestablished and documented\u201d that Gershkovich was acting on CIA instructions in the month he was arrested, alleging he had \u201ccollected secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. \u201cGershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d it said in a statement. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday said the allegations against Gershkovich have \u201cabsolutely zero credibility.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime. The charges against him are false, and the Russian government knows that they\u2019re false. He should be released immediately,\u201d Miller said at a State Department briefing. In the year since his arrest, the 32-year-old journalist has been imprisoned in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times. On Thursday, the State Department\u2019s top hostage official confirmed \u201cas of today, Evan\u2019s detention and the investigative process has ended.\u201d Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said Gershkovich was likely to be moved from Lefortovo to Yekaterinburg \u2013 more than 800 miles away \u2013before the end of June, and was then likely to stand trial in that city. \u201cIf it\u2019s anything like what happened to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, there\u2019ll be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won\u2019t have any contact with him,\u201d Carstens explained, referencing other Americans wrongfully detained in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019ll almost be like it\u2019s gone dark, but eventually, an American or I would say, a detainee surfaces in Yekaterinburg and we\u2019ll have a chance to reestablish that connectivity from there,\u201d Carstens said at a congressional hearing. Responding to Thursday\u2019s announcement, WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said Gershkovich is facing a \u201cfalse and baseless\u201d charge. \u201cRussia\u2019s latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime\u2019s smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan\u2019s case is an assault on free press,\u201d Tucker said in a statement. Reporters Without Borders, an international group promoting press freedom, denounced Gershkovich\u2019s indictment. \u201cThe espionage accusations must be abandoned and Evan immediately liberated,\u201d it said in a statement. US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, speaking after Gershkovich\u2019s pre-trial detention was extended in March, said: \u201cEvan\u2019s case is not about evidence, due process, or rule of law. It is about using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\u201d She called on the Kremlin \u201cto let Evan go.\u201d Proposed swaps Miller, the State Department spokesperson, reiterated on Thursday that the US would continue to pursue Gershkovich\u2019s release, as well that of Whelan, a former US marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he and the US deny. \u201cWe put a substantial offer on the table to secure the release of Evan and Paul Whelan some months ago, as we said,\u201d Miller said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re continuing to work to secure their release. We don\u2019t talk about all the details of that publicly.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted earlier in the year that \u201can agreement can be reached\u201d with the United States to release Gershkovich, as he brought up the conviction of a \u201cpatriotic\u201d Russian hitman in Germany. Speaking in a lengthy and at times ponderous interview with American right-wing pundit Tucket Carlson in February, Putin alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\u201d Putin said. Russian government officials\u00a0have\u00a0previously requested\u00a0that Krasikov be released as part of a proposed prisoner swap of notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for US citizens Griner and Whelan\u00a0according to US officials and\u00a0CNN reporting. Griner, a professional basketball player, was freed in a prisoner exchange for Bout while Whelan remains in prison. Speaking to CNN in Berlin to mark the year since Gershkovich\u2019s detention, Polina Ivanova \u2013 one of his closest friends and a reporter at the Financial Times \u2013 said he was doing \u201cremarkably well\u201d and passing most of his time writing letters \u201ctrying to make us feel better.\u201d \u201cWhen you see Putin talk about it in very clear terms that this is what they want to see happen, that they are looking for a deal, it gives you hope that at some point he will be home. He needs to be home,\u201d Ivanova said. In recent years, Russia has detained a number of other Americans. Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was detained in June 2023, Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina was\u00a0arrested in January, and American teacher Marc Fogel\u00a0was arrested in August 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/russia-evan-gershkovich-court-trial-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_russia-ukraine-mariupol-hunger-war-crime-intl", "text": "A group of international human rights lawyers has accused Russia of intentionally starving the civilians of Mariupol as a method of warfare during its 85-day siege of the Ukrainian city in early 2022. A 76-page dossier published Thursday by the Starvation Mobile Justice Team of the human rights organization Global Rights Compliance\u00a0looks in detail at the siege, which it described as \u201chell on earth\u201d for the port city\u2019s residents, through the lens of the war crime of starvation as a calculated strategy. It found that Russian forces \u201csystematically attacked objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population,\u201d while at the same time cutting off evacuation routes and blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid. Ukrainian civilians were cut off from water, electricity and gas and forced to drink from puddles, radiators\u00a0and melted snow. The findings didn\u2019t come as a surprise to Nikolai Osychenko, who described living through the siege as a \u201cStone Age\u201d experience. \u201cThe Russians bombed the substation that supplied electricity to Mariupol on March 2 and we lost electricity, and at the same time, we also lost the water supply and heating,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the city started running out of food almost immediately, because without electricity, much of it has gone bad. \u201cWe all realized that flour is the best thing to have. If you have water and flour, you can cook something.\u00a0But without water, you can\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. The Mariupol resident spent two weeks living in one apartment with nine other people, rationing food and scraping together any water they could find. They would spend two days melting buckets of snow with their hand, only to get a few inches of dirty water. Osychenko told CNN that at one point, he drank the water from his radiators, boiling it 20 times over to purify it. Deliberately causing starvation and deprivation constitutes a war crime under international law. The group is in the process of submitting their latest report to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as part of a larger dossier on Russia\u2019s use of starvation. According to their website, the organization is funded by the governments of the EU Commission, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. CNN has reached out to Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense for comment. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, was encircled and captured by Russian forces at the start of\u00a0the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0Local officials estimate\u00a0that as many as 22,000\u00a0people\u00a0were killed in the battle for the city, which is located in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk Oblast and has been under direct Russian control since May 2022. \u2018Hell on earth\u2019 It was in\u00a0Mariupol\u00a0that Russian forces carried out some of their most notorious strikes, including an\u00a0attack on a maternity hospital and the\u00a0bombing of a theater\u00a0in which up to 1,300 civilians had sought refuge, according to local officials. The report,\u00a0entitled,\u00a0\u201c\u2019The Hope Left Us:\u2019\u00a0Russia\u2019s Siege, Starvation, and Capture of Mariupol City\u2019\u201d explores how \u201cpeaceful\u201d Mariupol was turned into \u201chell on earth\u201d in February 2022. It uses open-source research to analyse over 1.5 billion square meters of satellite imagery, as well as photographs, videos, official public statements, and other digital data collected between May 2022 and February 2024. Its several hundred\u00a0thousand\u00a0residents were forced to find alternative coping strategies during Russia\u2019s siege, amid dwindling supplies and the obstruction of humanitarian aid. This included the establishment of ad hoc distribution points for food, water and other basic necessities. These distribution points, however, including the\u00a0Mariupol Drama Theater\u00a0and Neptun\u00a0Swimming Pool Complex, became targets for the Russian army. \u201cSustained attacks against Mariupol City forced the distribution of essential items to become largely\u00a0mobile in order to mitigate risks of shelling, though a significant number of both mobile and stationary distribution points were still shelled, repeatedly exposing vulnerable and hungry residents to significant risk to their lives and means of securing basic necessities,\u201d the report found. It also found several instances where the delivery of vital humanitarian aid was allegedly denied or deliberately obstructed by Russian forces, while civilians were unable to evacuate from the city. \u201cDespite Russian forces\u2019 command failing to halt hostilities in order to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, aid delivery was also directly blocked by pro-Russian forces operating at checkpoints erected around evacuation corridors between Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia.\u201d 85-day offensive Osychenko said he and his family survived the ordeal thanks to his wife\u2019s and niece\u2019s careful planning. \u201cThey were in charge of food and they divided the food very clearly: so much porridge, so much this and so much that for the day. Once I caught them not eating at all. They cooked for us but they didn\u2019t eat because they knew that there was nowhere to get food, and there was less and less of it,\u201d he said. Yousuf Syed Khan, a senior lawyer with law firm Global Rights Compliance, told CNN\u00a0he believes\u00a0there was no doubt that the siege of Mariupol amounted to a war crime. \u201cThey [the Russian army] did not allow for international organizations to provide civilian evacuations\u2026 even though the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as well as the United Nations attempted numerous times to evacuate civilians. \u201cNumber two is that they did not allow the entry of humanitarian aid. So not once through the 85-day offensive was there any pause in which they allowed humanitarian aid to enter Mariupol.\u201d Khan continued: \u201cOn top of that, they were attacking indispensable objects. They were attacking electricity, they were attacking water. They were attacking food distribution points.\u201d There\u00a0were numerous opportunities for Russian forces to alleviate civilian suffering,\u00a0he said, but they failed to\u00a0do so. Osychenko said that with each day, the situation was getting more and more desperate. Mothers that had small children, many of them \u00a0lost milk from the stress and hunger, there was no formula, no children food,\u201d he said. When Russian troops took over the city, they tried to take advantage of the desperate situation. \u201cWhen Russia came to the city, when they started delivering food to people in basements, giving candies to children, even if you hate Russia, you will go out to them and take it. Because you have nothing to eat, your kids have nothing to drink. It\u2019s brutal,\u201d he said. Khan said the way Moscow\u00a0approached the siege was part of a broader strategy\u00a0that\u00a0Russian and pro-Russian forces have used regularly in the past eight years. He pointed to sieges laid by pro-Russian forces across Syria, including those in\u00a0eastern Aleppo City\u00a0and Ghouta, as examples of heavy-handed Russian tactics. Ukrainian authorities and some international officials have previously accused\u00a0Russia of robbing the country of grain\u00a0and other commodities in areas it occupied.\u00a0Accusations that Russia is using food as a\u00a0weapon of war\u00a0have been mounting ever since the first reports emerged in the spring of 2022 of grain being stolen by Russian troops. The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Ukraine. It has so far issued four arrest warrants related to Ukraine, including for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the alleged deportation of Ukrainian children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/russia-ukraine-mariupol-hunger-war-crime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_style_hot-rodent-men-celebrities", "text": "In the Chinese zodiac, 2024 is the year of the dragon. To the internet, it is the year of the rat. It began, seemingly, with a few innocuous social media posts comparing Mike Faist, co-star of the titillating tennis throuple film \u201cChallengers,\u201d to a dormouse. Soon, the complexity of the analogy snowballed to odd levels of specificity: He\u2019s a field mouse. No, he\u2019s a cartoon mouse. No, he\u2019s Despereaux (the dumbo-eared mouse from the 2008 animated film \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux\u201d). No, he\u2019s Stuart Little, if Stuart Little was hot. He was \u201clike if a sleepy cartoon mouse came to life and then got really into cross fit,\u201d wrote journalist Lucy Ford on X. And it wasn\u2019t long until fans on social media began examining the facial features of other male celebrities for similar signs of rodent likeness \u2014 Faist\u2019s \u201cChallengers\u201d co-star Josh O\u2019Connor, for example. Barry Keoghan. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Jeremy Allen White. Glen Powell. This list goes on. From chinchillas to capybaras,\u00a0the rodent comparisons sped across social media like a runaway wheel of cheese, warping the image (and perhaps the confidence) of many popular, young white male celebrities in its path. On June 2, a Daily Mail article introduced this internet in-joke to the masses. \u201cHow \u2018hot rodent\u2019 men became Hollywood\u2019s sexiest heartthrobs: Gen Z fans are going wild for actors with unusual features including Barry Keoghan, Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Allen White,\u201d read the headline. The trend has since been covered by the New York Times, the Guardian, the London Times, NBC and the Today Show, among others. How do these men \u2014 heartthrobs of the moment, even \u2014 feel about being categorized as \u201chot rodents\u201d? Powell, who was first likened to a rodent back in 2023, has gamely praised the ingenuity of the chronically online. \u201cThis is why the internet\u2019s a great place,\u201d he told Jimmy Fallon last December. \u201cI really kind of own the capybara thing now. I am the capybara.\u201d Despite outreach, CNN did not receive a response from O\u2019Connor, Chalamet, Keoghan or White. (Faist\u2019s agent, meanwhile, confirmed that the actor does not use social media. A small mercy). But more broadly, the informal sampling of average Joes \u2014 or should that be average Jerrys? \u2014 CNN reached for comment largely didn\u2019t mind being dubbed ratty. Surveyed in a Whatsapp friend group, one 20-something admitted hearing the term would \u201churt,\u201d while another said he would be happy to embrace \u201chot rat summer.\u201d A third man polled shared\u00a0that despite an initial knee jerk reaction, he understood that \u201crodent men are very hot right now\u201d and so would probably be \u201cflattered.\u201d For some, the question goes beyond the hypothetical. One had already been called a \u201crat boy\u201d by his current girlfriend. \u201cShe\u2019s still with me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo I\u2019ve taken it well.\u201d Similarly, Gustav, a 22-year-old X user, has also been compared to a mouse. (Stuart Little, to be precise \u2014 just like Faist.) \u201cI\u2019d say I mostly found the comment amusing,\u201d he told CNN via X. \u201cIt was clearly not meant as an insult and even though some people would take it as an insult, I mostly felt it was a way of saying that I was cute.\u201d While by no means exhaustive, these responses suggest men feel mostly fine with the \u201chot rodent\u201d trend. But if any male celebrity is struggling with the break-neck transition from traditional dreamboat to furry pin-up, perhaps the Chinese zodiac \u2014 which believes rats to be among the most intelligent, popular and charming animals of the 12-year cycle \u2014 can be some comfort, after all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/style/hot-rodent-men-celebrities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Catherine, who revealed in March she has been diagnosed with cancer, said in a new statement on Friday that she has experienced \u201cgood days and bad days\u201d while undergoing chemotherapy, and expects her treatment to continue \u201cfor a few more months.\u201d But she is expected to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony with the royal family on Saturday at Trooping the Colour, King Charles III\u2019s birthday parade, and Kensington Palace have released a new photo of the Princess taken earlier this week in Windsor. \u201cI am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,\u201d the Princess, who is often known as Kate, said in a personal message released on Friday. \u201cOn those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.\u201d \u201cMy treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months,\u201d Kate wrote. \u201cOn the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.\u201d She said she is hoping to join some more engagements over the summer, but acknowledged she is \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d King Charles III is \u201cdelighted\u201d to hear that Kate will be attending royal events on Saturday, according to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson Friday. \u201cHis Majesty is delighted that The Princess is able to attend tomorrow\u2019s events, and is much looking forward to all elements of the day,\u201d the spokesperson said. Kate will travel down the Mall in a carriage during Saturday\u2019s Trooping the Colour, accompanied by her children. She will watch the rest of the parade with her family nearby, and is expected to join fellow royals on the balcony. It represents a significant moment in the Princess\u2019s recovery, marking her first public appearance since Christmas Day \u2013 weeks before her cancer diagnosis. But it does not represent a return to public duties, and throughout her recovery, any appearances will be taken alongside medical guidance and will be subject to change if required. \u201cI have been blown away by all the kind messages of support and encouragement over the last couple of months,\u201d Kate wrote. \u201cIt really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times.\u201d \u201cI am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal.\u201d Kate first stepped away from public duties in January, following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. In March, amid speculation about her wellbeing, she revealed in a video message that she had been diagnosed with cancer after the operation. \u201cMy medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy,\u201d she said in that update, adding she was in the early stages of that treatment. The Princess\u2019s cancer diagnosis stunned the country, especially as it came so soon after Charles announced that he had also been diagnosed with cancer. Neither royal has specified the type of cancer they are receiving treatment for, or revealed details about their progress. Charles said in March he was \u201cso proud\u201d of Catherine, his daughter-in-law, for \u201cher courage in speaking as she did\u201d in sharing her diagnosis. Kate has not appeared in public or taken on any formal duties since her announcement, but her husband Prince William has returned to his roles. He recently traveled to France for the events marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, alongside his father King Charles III.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/uk/catherine-princess-of-wales-cancer-update-appearance-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_americas_russian-navy-cuba-intl", "text": "A group of Russian Navy ships, including a nuclear-powered submarine, arrived in Cuba on Wednesday morning in a sign of strengthening ties between the two Cold War allies. Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov \u2013 the first of a four-ship convoy \u2013 fired a 21-gun salute after entering Havana harbor, which was answered by the Cubans with cannon fire from an 18th-century\u00a0colonial fort built by the Spanish to guard the port. The Gorshkov is one of the Russian Navy\u2019s most modern ships, and was followed by the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, a rescue tug, and an oil tanker. Onlookers and fishermen lined the seafront to watch the vessels arrive in the harbor. A CNN team on the ground saw members of the small Russian community in Cuba and Russian diplomats carrying national flags to welcome the crews. Some of the Cubans present told CNN they had never seen a submarine enter the bay of Havana before. The four Russian ships are now docked in berths usually occupied by cruise ships. It marks the largest show of force by the Russians with their longstanding ally Cuba in many years. The US assesses that the Kazan does not have nuclear weapons on board, a US official said. The vessels will carry out a five-day official visit to the Caribbean island \u2013 a show of Russian force just 90 miles from Florida as tensions rise between the US and Russia over the war in Ukraine. Cubans will be permitted to tour the frigate following the arrival of the convoy of ships, a Russian diplomatic source told CNN. The Russian diplomat told CNN that starting Thursday, \u201cthe general public\u201d in\u00a0Cuba\u00a0will be allowed to tour the Gorshkov frigate for four hours each day for three days. Military analysts believe it is capable of long-range missions, anti-submarine warfare, and carrying\u00a0surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, among other weapons\u00a0systems. US Navy \u2018monitors\u2019 exercises En route to Cuba, the Russian warships conducted drills in the Atlantic, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Tuesday. The crews of the frigate and the nuclear submarine missile cruiser practiced the use of high-precision missile weapons using computer simulation for naval targets, designating ship groupings of a simulated enemy located at a distance of over 600 km, according to the Russian MOD, Russian state media TASS\u00a0reports. US officials told CNN that the\u00a0US\u00a0military\u00a0had deployed ships and planes to monitor Russia\u2019s\u00a0military\u00a0exercises in the Atlantic and the Caribbean,\u00a0and has been\u00a0tracking\u00a0the Russian vessels as they transited the Atlantic in recent days en route to Cuba. US\u00a0Navy ships that have been\u00a0tracking\u00a0the Russian vessels include the\u00a0USS Truxtun, the\u00a0USS Donald Cook, and Coast Guard vessel the\u00a0USCGC Stone, the\u00a0US\u00a0official confirmed. The\u00a0US\u00a0has also deployed air\u00a0assets, including a P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance plane, to circle overhead the Russian vessels. Canada has also deployed\u00a0assets\u00a0to monitor the activity, the official said. The official added that the\u00a0US\u00a0has been monitoring the flotilla\u2019s movements \u201cthe whole time,\u201d which is a normal part of the\u00a0US\u2019 maritime homeland defense, and all vessels including the Russians have remained in international waters. Pentagon and State Department officials have also sought to emphasize that the Russian activity is routine and poses no threat to the\u00a0US, and have noted that\u00a0Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. Still, the Russian transit to the region comes at a particularly tense moment between Washington and Moscow, several weeks after President Joe Biden agreed to allow Ukraine to strike inside Russia directly\u00a0using\u00a0US-provided weapons. Stopover \u2018does not represent a threat\u2019 Cuba\u00a0said last week that such visits were standard practice by naval units from countries friendly to Havana, and insisted the stopover does not represent a threat to the region. \u201cVisits by naval units from other countries are a historical practice of the revolutionary government with nations that maintain relations of friendship and collaboration,\u201d a statement from Cuba\u2019s Foreign Ministry said. According to a Cuban Armed Forces Ministry statement, none of the Russian ships are armed with nuclear weapons. Cuba has long had good relations with Russia. It was a key ally to the former Soviet Union during the Cold War that briefly hosted nuclear missiles at Moscow\u2019s behest during the 1962\u00a0Cuban Missile Crisis. The arrival of the ships on Wednesday signals Moscow\u2019s strengthening ties with Havana in light of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Cuba is also increasingly reliant on Russian oil and aid as the communist-run country weathers its\u00a0worst economic crisis in decades.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/americas/russian-navy-cuba-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_australia_australia-boy-arrested-deepfakes-schoolgirls-intl-hnk", "text": "Australian authorities are investigating the distribution of deepfake pornographic images of around 50 schoolgirls, allegedly created by a teenager using artificial intelligence. The discovery comes as the federal government pushes for new laws to impose prison sentences on offenders who create and share images made by AI tools to humiliate and denigrate victims. Other countries, including the United States, are attempting to address an alarming rise in deepfake porn, where nude deepfakes of schoolgirls have been created and shared\u00a0 \u2013 in some instances, allegedly by schoolboys. Victoria Police confirmed they had arrested and released a teenager \u201cin relation to explicit images being circulated online\u201d pending further inquiries. The images were reportedly created using photos posted to social media of 50 female students of Bacchus Marsh Grammar, a co-educational school on the outskirts of Melbourne in Victoria. The school\u2019s principal Andrew Neal told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the victims were girls in grades 9 to 12, indicating a possible age range of between 14 and 18. The boy\u2019s age and identity are unknown, but Neal told the ABC that \u201clogic would suggest that the [offender] is someone at the school.\u201d Speaking to the ABC on Wednesday, the mother of a 16-year-old female Bacchus Marsh Grammar\u00a0student, whose image wasn\u2019t used, said her daughter vomited when she saw the \u201cmutilated\u201d pictures online. \u201cI went and picked my daughter up from a sleepover and she was very upset, and she was throwing up and it was incredibly graphic,\u201d the mother told ABC Radio Melbourne, giving only her first name, Emily. The school said in a statement that it was offering counseling to the students\u00a0and assisting police with their investigation. \u201cThe wellbeing of Bacchus Marsh Grammar students and their families is of paramount importance to the school and is being addressed,\u201d the statement said. Legal fight to stop deepfakes Social media companies, including X and Meta say all nonconsensual pornography is banned on their platforms, but explicit AI-generated images continue to quickly spread\u00a0online. Last November, New Jersey high school student Francesca Mani, 14, led public demands for a federal crackdown in the US against AI-generated deepfake pornography, saying images of her and dozens of her classmates at Westfield High School had been manipulated. High-profile victims of explicit doctored images include Taylor Swift \u00a0and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In March, Ocasio-Cortez introduced federal legislation \u2013 the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act of 2024 (DEFIANCE Act) \u2013 to give victims the power to sue people who create non-consensual deepfakes of them. However, the bi-partisan legislation, backed by senior Republicans, failed to pass a motion for unanimous consent Wednesday, according to a statement by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Victoria is the only Australian state where sharing deepfake pornography is a criminal offense. In 2022, the state government introduced three-year jail terms for using technology to generate or share child abuse material, or sexually explicit material without consent. This month, the Australian government introduced legislation to criminalize the distribution of deepfake pornography nationwide. Under the proposed law, offenders could face up to six years in prison for sharing non-consensual sexually explicit deepfake material. If the offender has also created the deepfake content that is shared without permission, the sentence could rise to seven years in prison. It\u2019s part of the country\u2019s response to gender-based violence that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d So far this year, 35 women have been killed, according to the Counting Dead Women project \u2013 many allegedly by current or former partners. Just last month, the state government appointed a Parliamentary Secretary for Men\u2019s Behavior Change, in an Australian first. On his appointment, MP Tim Richardson said he would focus on the impact of the internet and social media on men\u2019s attitudes toward women. In a statement on Wednesday,\u00a0Victoria State Premier Jacinta Allan said the alleged actions of the teenager were \u201cdisgraceful and misogynistic.\u201d \u201cWomen and girls deserve respect in class, online and everywhere else in our community, which is why we have made laws against this behavior and we are teaching respectful relationships in schools to stop violence before it starts,\u201d Allan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/australia/australia-boy-arrested-deepfakes-schoolgirls-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_european-elections-explainer-intl", "text": "Results are being announced in the\u00a0European\u00a0parliamentary elections \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest democratic exercises \u2013 and a few clear narratives have emerged from the days-long poll. Far-right parties across the continent had strong showings, but their momentum did not cause the center ground of European politics to cave in \u2013 as many had predicted. Instead, liberal and Green groups lost seats and relevance in the European Parliament. Meanwhile, domestic politics was upended in some countries, including France \u2013 where new elections were announced. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Far right makes gains Ahead of the vote, eyes across Europe were fixed mainly on the continent\u2019s far-right parties \u2013 with gains by those groups expected to form a major part of Sunday\u2019s narrative. Those gains did materialize; far-right groups were expected to secure a record number of seats in the European Parliament, dealing a major blow to the continent\u2019s establishment leaders. Far-right parties were set to win around 150 of the parliament\u2019s 720 seats, an exit poll projected, potentially frustrating efforts by mainstream parties to form majorities needed to pass laws. Most of the far-right gains were concentrated in countries that elect large numbers of seats: France, Italy and Germany. But the parties must still work to build a consensus if they are to maximize their political threat. Germany\u2019s AfD is politically homeless: it was removed from the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) party after its main European candidate, Maximilian Krah, said he did not consider all members of the Nazi group, the SS, to be criminals. Several other far-right parties are among the non-aligned (NI) group, predicted to secure 45 seats. The center holds Despite a far-right surge, the centrist European People\u2019s Party (EPP) was the biggest single winner on Sunday night. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech late on Sunday that the group \u2013 predicted to secure the most seats \u2013 could still act as an \u201canchor of stability.\u201d But she called on her political allies to help guard against extremist parties. \u201cThe center is holding. But it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right have gained support, and this is why the result comes with great responsibility for the parties in the center,\u201d she told an audience in Brussels. Von der Leyen appeared to rule out any possibility of the party banding together with the far-right factions, telling journalists that she will be reaching out to The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and centrist and liberal Renew Europe to form a \u201cbroad majority for a strong Europe.\u201d Von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term as European Commission president, outlined her desire to keep pushing on with parties who are \u201cpro-European, pro-Ukraine, pro-rule-of-law.\u201d National politics in disarray The results massively disrupted politics in several European countries, as gains from previously fringe groups became impossible for some leaders to ignore. French President Emmanuel Macron called a stunning snap election on Sunday after his party was trounced by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN). \u201cI have decided to give you back the choice of your parliamentary future by voting. I am therefore dissolving the National Assembly this evening,\u201d Macron said. The elections to pick a new parliament will take place on 30 June and 7 July. France\u2019s main far-right electoral lists in the European Elections took more than one in three votes cast, according to official results from the French Interior Ministry Monday. France returns \u2013 the European elections list for Marine Le Pen\u2019s RN party \u2013 and the list headed by her niece Marion Mar\u00e9chal won 36.83% of votes cast, more than the next three parties combined. In a celebratory speech at the RN headquarters before Macron\u2019s shock announcement, party leader Jordan Bardella said the \u201cunprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era.\u201d Belgium\u2019s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo meanwhile resigned after his party suffered a disastrous defeat in national and European parliamentary elections. The 48-year-old politician struggled to hold back his tears when announcing the decision on Sunday evening in Brussels. \u201cI was the figurehead of this campaign. This is not the result I had hoped for, and I, therefore, take responsibility for this result. It was not meant to be,\u201d De Croo told journalists. Meloni and Tusk have good nights Few major EU leaders enjoyed results night, but Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saw her party make gains, and ended the process as a major player in European politics. Her domestic party, Brothers of Italy, was the most rightwing to be elected to government in Italy since that of Benito Mussolini, the wartime fascist leader. But Meloni has proven a pragmatic figure in Europe, becoming an ally of von der Leyen, and a staunch supporter of Ukraine, while pushing the bloc to take a firmer stance on migration. Those efforts could accelerate after Brothers of Italy won the country\u2019s vote. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s efforts to make Poland a force in Brussels were boosted after his party held off the populist opposition Law and Justice (PiS) group to secure an outright victory. Tusk has rebuilt Warsaw\u2019s reputation at the European table after defeating PiS in a national election last October. The former European Council President made reintegration with Europe a key pillar of his campaign and his time in office, while the strategic significance of Poland to the bloc has increased following Russia\u2019s invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Brussels\u2019 mainstream leaders will also be relieved that Hungary\u2019s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, for so long a thorn in the EU\u2019s side, was dealt a blow on Sunday. His party Fidesz suffered its worst European election results to date, ceding ground to its center-right opponents. Greens fall back As fringe parties on the right made gains, left-wing groups, and in particular the Greens, were squeezed across Europe. Early results showed that Green support in France and Germany suffered especially huge drops in seats. \u201cThe losses in Germany and France are obviously a blow,\u201d Bas Eickhout, the Greens/EFA vice-president and lead candidate of the European Green Party, admitted in a statement as results came in. The group insisted they would work to push the new parliament to prioritize work on the climate, but their standing is severely diminished and it remains to be seen how much Europe\u2019s leaders will need to rely on their support. The European Commission announced one of the world\u2019s most ambitious goals to slash planet-heating pollution in February, but faces opposition in rural areas around the continent, with farmers\u2019 unions saying the plans represent a threat to their livelihoods.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/european-elections-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_middleeast_israel-detention-palestinians-release-intl-latam", "text": "The Palestinian Legislative Council in Gaza has demanded international inspections of Israeli detention centers, after the release of a number of prisoners this week who appeared frail and thin after several months in detention. Among those released was the Council\u2019s former Speaker, Aziz Dweik, who had been held for nine months, accused of affiliation with Hamas. He appeared much thinner and greyer than before being detained. The Council said it \u201clooks with anger at the crimes committed by the enemy against the prisoners, and the greatest example is the photo of Dr. Aziz Dweik when he left the occupation prisons.\u201d The Council alleged that the prisoners had been subjected to starvation, isolation and torture. Dweik himself said Friday that prisoners were\u00a0\u201cstarved for 24 hours a day. The prisoners are in poor health conditions, suffering from skin diseases, and the food is insufficient even for children, let alone meeting the needs of men.\u201d He added that sugar, salt, and fruit were virtually absent in the prisons. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces and prison authorities for a response to the allegations made by the Council. Most of the approximately 30 prisoners released from the Negev and Ofer prisoners this week were administrative detainees, who had not been charged with any offenses. One of them, according to the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society, was Saed Abu Shanab from Tulkarm, who had spent 21 years in Israeli prisons. The Prisoners\u2019 Society said that the condition of the prisoners \u201creflect some of the harsh and humiliating conditions of detention, including acts of torture, abuse and starvation, in addition to medical crimes.\u201d In May, CNN published an investigation based on testimonies from whistleblowers at the Negev facility which reported that \u201cdoctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from constant handcuffing; [and] of medical procedures sometimes performed by underqualified medics.\u201d In response to that reporting, the IDF responded that it \u201censures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly.\u201d The Israeli military has acknowledged partially converting\u00a0three different military facilities into detention camps for Palestinian detainees from Gaza\u00a0since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel. The Prisoners\u2019 Society said in April that the vast majority of detainees released suffered from health problems \u201cwhich required the transfer of some of them to the hospital immediately upon their release.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/middleeast/israel-detention-palestinians-release-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_middleeast_israel-catapult-trebuchet-lebanon-intl", "text": "Israeli troops have used a medieval-style catapult to toss fireballs across the border into Lebanon, as fighting ramps up between Israel and the Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah. The trebuchet, a rotating arm with a sling attached to launch a projectile, has rarely been used since the 16th century. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the catapult was \u201ca local initiative\u201d and had not \u201ccome into widespread use,\u201d Israeli public broadcaster and CNN affiliate Kan reported Thursday. Kan said the trebuchet was probably used to burn shrubbery, making it easier for Israeli forces to identify militants attempting to reach the border. CNN has asked the IDF for comment. A video of the catapult in action was posted on social media on Wednesday. CNN could not verify when the footage was filmed but geolocated it to the Israeli-Lebanese border. While there have been reports of catapults being used by Ukrainian demonstrators during the Euromaidan protests in 2014, and by Syrian rebels in 2013, the weapon is a relic of bygone military ages. One of the last recorded uses of a large-scale trebuchet in warfare was by the Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s against the Aztecs during the assault on Tenochtitl\u00e1n, Mexico in 1521, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. The use of trebuchets and other catapults began to dwindle after the invention of modern gunpowder artillery in the 15th century. The video comes after cross-border attacks from Lebanon led to large fires blazing through the north of Israel last week, consuming swaths of land and leading to the evacuation of residents. Cross-border attacks have spiked this month, but there has been low-intensity fighting since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, when militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted 200 others, according to Israeli officials. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has leveled much of the Strip and killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan officials. Hezbollah has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. Its military capability is believed to be far greater than that of Hamas and has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets, which could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war broke out. More than 53,000 Israelis have been evacuated from the north since hostilities began in October, the IDF told CNN. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from the border area, according to the country\u2019s health ministry.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/middleeast/israel-catapult-trebuchet-lebanon-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_10_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea sent a new wave of trash-laden balloons toward its southern neighbor late Sunday, after Kim Jong Un\u2019s powerful sister warned of further responses if the South keeps up its \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d The new balloons, which Seoul has previously slammed as \u201cbase and dangerous,\u201d come in apparent retaliation for the decision by South Korea to resume broadcasting anti-North Korean\u00a0propaganda over loudspeakers in border areas. Kim\u2019s sister and government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation.\u201d In a statement carried by North Korean state media, Kim said South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d\u00a0from the North if it continued with the loudspeaker broadcasts and failed to prevent activists from\u00a0sending anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border. \u201cI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once this dangerous act,\u201d Kim said, adding that Seoul is creating a \u201cnew environment of crisis.\u201d South\u00a0Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\u00a0has maintained North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d In a statement Monday, a JCS spokesman would not say whether the South would continue to broadcast over the loudspeakers, noting only that\u00a0the military would conduct missions \u201cwith flexibility according to the strategic and operational situation.\u201d The escalating tit-for-tat has sparked concerns of potential retaliatory military action. Last week, the South Korean government suspended a 2018 deal\u00a0to reduce military tensions with the North, allowing it to resume propaganda broadcasts and potentially restart military exercises along the border. South Korea\u2019s military once routinely deployed propaganda broadcasts as a means of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following the 2018 deal. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d and the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and modern Korean culture, according to the JCS. Tit-for-tat balloons In recent weeks, the North has floated more than a thousand trash-filled balloons across the heavily fortified border, in what it claims is a response to the years-long practice among South Korean activist groups of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets in the other direction. As of Monday morning, the South Korean military had found \u201caround 50 balloons\u201d that fell into its territory overnight Sunday. Many other balloons are believed to have flown back into\u00a0North\u00a0Korea due to the wind, according to the JCS spokesman. On Thursday, South Korean activists sent balloons across the border toward the North, carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting\u00a0strict rules to snap back\u00a0into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_china_china-metoo-journalist-huang-xueqin-sentenced-intl-hnk", "text": "A leading #MeToo journalist in China has been sentenced to five years in prison on subversion charges, according to supporters, as the ruling Communist Party ramps up its effort to dismantle what remains of the country\u2019s civil society. Huang Xueqin, an independent journalist, was found guilty by the Guangzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court Friday for \u201cinciting subversion of state power,\u201d supporters said. Labor activist Wang Jianbin, another defendant in the case, was sentenced to three and a half years, according to supporters, who shared a copy of the verdict on X. Huang told the court she would appeal, the supporters said, though it was not immediately clear if Wang would also appeal. Huang, 36, and Wang, 40, have already spent nearly three years behind bars within China\u2019s opaque judicial system. They were detained by authorities in the southern city of Guangzhou in September 2021 and stood trial behind closed doors in September last year. Huang, who worked as an investigative reporter for liberal-leaning media outlets in Guangzhou before becoming an independent journalist, had been an instrumental figure in sparking China\u2019s #MeToo movement. In 2018, she helped bring about the country\u2019s first #MeToo case, using her influential social media presence to amplify the voice of a graduate student who accused her PhD supervisor of unwanted sexual advances. She also spoke up about her own experiences of sexual harassment as a young intern at a national news agency, where she claimed she was groped and kissed by a senior male reporter and mentor. To show the prevalence of the issue, she surveyed 416 female journalists in 2018 and found 84% of them had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. \u201cThere are so few people prosecuted because there are only so few victims who report,\u201d she told CNN in a 2018 interview. \u201cTo most victims, it\u2019s shame.\u201d Huang and Wang were detained the day before Huang was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom to start her master\u2019s degree on gender violence and conflict at the University of Sussex. In a statement on Friday, Amnesty International noted the pair\u2019s conviction came a day before the 1,000th day of their first arrest. \u201cThese convictions will prolong their deeply unjust detention and have a further chilling effect on human rights and social advocacy in a country where activists face increasing state crackdowns,\u201d the rights group said. \u201cThese malicious and totally groundless convictions show just how terrified the Chinese government is of the emerging wave of activists who dare to speak out to protect the rights of others.\u201d Chinese courts are\u00a0tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party\u00a0and have a conviction rate above 99.9%. \u2018Isolated atoms\u2019 Authorities have offered no details about Huang and Wang\u2019s charges, but supporters believe their arrest could be related to weekly friends\u2019 gatherings held at Wang\u2019s apartment. In the months following their detention, more than 70 friends and supporters of Huang and Wang were summoned by the police for questioning,\u00a0according to supporters. Some were forced to sign fabricated testimonies against the pair, claiming they had organized political gatherings to criticize the government, their supporters claimed. Huang\u2019s close friend said participants of the gatherings were a loose group of friends who cared about public affairs \u2013 from feminism, LGBTQ and labor rights to environmental protection. In addition to sharing their experiences and views, they also played board games and sometimes went hiking together. A close friend of Huang previously told CNN the journalist had suffered significant weight loss in detention and stopped menstruating for months. She was undernourished and persistent back pain, said the friend, who requested anonymity fearing retribution by authorities. \u201cIt\u2019s a community where everyone supports each other. But it\u2019s been disbanded ever since the detention. I have no sense of belonging anymore,\u201d the friend told CNN last year ahead of the closed-door trial. \u201cThe crackdown by authorities turned us into isolated atoms \u2013 it is difficult for everyone to band together again. The entire community is suppressed and silenced.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/china/china-metoo-journalist-huang-xueqin-sentenced-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Over 200 people were in the audience, with more than 100 comedians from 15 countries. The 87-year-old pontiff is known for his sense of humor. He likes to crack jokes with people he meets, often telling them with a smile: \u201cplease pray for me\u2026 not against me!\u201d He has repeatedly emphasized the importance of having a sense of humor, saying it is something that he prays for each day. \u201cA sense of humor lifts you up, it shows your life is short and to take things in the spirit of a redeemer,\u201d Francis once said in an interview. \u201cIt is a human attribute, but it is the closest to God\u2019s grace.\u201d Francis\u2019 meeting on Friday with\u00a0\u201cartists from the world of humor\u201d\u00a0is part of his latest attempt to engage with contemporary culture, with the Vatican explaining in a statement that the meeting underlines how the \u201cart of comedy can contribute to a more empathetic and supportive world.\u201d It follows on from his\u00a0landmark visit to the Venice Biennale\u00a0and his meeting last year with\u00a0artists and directors in the Vatican.\u00a0The meeting also comes with the pope facing question marks over his outreach to\u00a0LGBTQ+ Catholics\u00a0after reportedly using a homophobic slur at private meetings.

{"id": "2024_06_12_americas_us-migrants-mexico-election-intl-latam", "text": "Norma regrets ever having called the police. A shop owner and local coordinator for a political party on the outskirts of Mexico City, Norma called authorities in November\u00a0to file a complaint about noise coming from the building next door to her house. The building was being used by a rival political party, she believes. Norma doesn\u2019t know what resulted from the police investigation, but the 35-year-old began receiving intimidating threats. Strange men began to approach her in the street and warn she didn\u2019t have long to live, she said. She tried moving to a relative\u2019s house, but noticed that she was being followed on the way. When that rival party won the municipal elections two weeks ago, Norma decided to leave town, she said, fearing that she would be further targeted. \u201cAfter the vote, it got ugly in my city,\u201d she said. CNN is using only\u00a0her first name due to concerns for her safety. CNN met Norma on a dusty road in southern Arizona, just moments after she and her three children\u00a0\u2013 13, 8 and 2 years old \u2013 climbed across the low fence that separates Mexico from the United States. They are among several migrant families on the border who told CNN\u00a0they were fleeing the fallout of Mexico\u2019s bloody national elections, which saw dozens of political candidates assassinated and hundreds threatened on the campaign trail. All said they hoped for asylum from the US government. And all said they had not heard of a new executive order by US President Joe Biden blocking asylum requests from most people illegally crossing the southern border during periods of high volume. A few miles east along the border, CNN met several more Mexican families who had been sheltering for days in a tent erected by a local humanitarian group. Bottles of water had been left out for them, along with signs warning to wait for Border Patrol agents to show up, rather than attempt to walk any further\u00a0under the hot sun. Some were fleeing general violence, a lack of jobs, kidnapping threats made to their families.\u00a0Two men with a family sitting on the ground in the stifling heat said they too had fled Mexico following the elections. They had received threats for supporting the wrong candidate in their town, one said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for the candidate \u2013 they were forcing us to.\u201d A wave of political killings and threats US officials have been keeping watch for new migration surges this summer. The violence surrounding Mexico\u2019s election this month is just one of many factors pushing some families to try to cross the border. \u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about elections in Mexico or here in the US, it always provokes a level of uncertainty with everyone, generally, but especially in the migrant population,\u201d a Homeland Security official previously told CNN. The June 2 vote was the biggest and most violent\u00a0in Mexico\u2019s history. With 20,000 electoral positions up for grabs, the scale of bloodshed committed by those attempting to influence the vote was massive; at least\u00a034 political candidates assassinated by criminal organizations during the campaign season. A May 28 report by research group Integralia identified 749 victims of political violence in Mexico, including 231 killings. Hundreds of candidates reported being threatened,\u00a0and many dropped out of their races, fearing for their lives. Intimidation was particularly pervasive in local-level elections, experts told CNN, where races could hand the winners broad control over small communities\u2019 police and fiscal resources. \u201cThe violence and threats were being done specifically to have the impact of saying that this party or these people or this group \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 is in control here. To create that environment of fear,\u201d said Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website. Zissis told CNN she was not surprised political violence might be displacing some Mexicans from their homes today, given a broader security crisis in the country, where the\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is one of the highest in the world. Hundreds of people faced threats during the election campaign, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking the candidates themselves, politicians in the parties, officials in the parties, violence against family members of candidates. So you can imagine that the issue of violence in general in Mexico \u2013 which is potentially getting people to leave their communities and flee \u2013 this could overlap with political violence as well,\u201d she said. Even while ballots were being counted, the attacks continued. One mayor, Yolanda S\u00e1nchez Figueroa of Cotija in Michoac\u00e1n state,\u00a0was assassinated the day after the election, while she was walking from a gym back to her house with her bodyguard. Both were\u00a0shot\u00a0dead\u00a0by people in a white van, the state attorney general said in a statement. US-Mexico cooperation on border control Mexico has worked closely with the US to ease\u00a0migratory pressure at the border, with multiple state agencies working to block or redirect asylum-seekers from around the world away from the US-Mexico border. But conditions at home appear to be pushing some Mexican citizens to join the northward flow. Salvador Guerrero, director of the Alaide Foppa Refugee Legal Clinic in Mexico City, said he worries the government\u2019s commitment to serving as a migration buffer for its northern neighbor has siphoned away resources and attention from interior security work. \u201cFor example, the National Guard was created to protect Mexico,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut for each criminal that the National Guard present to a judge, there are 80 migrants that they also present to relocate people\u00a0from the north to the south,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, impunity reigns in Mexico, where in addition to the high homicide rate, more than 100,000 people have gone missing\u00a0with no explanation of their fate. According to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua,\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved in\u00a02022. And while outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s social welfare programs have lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, the erosion of democratic guardrails and institutions under his watch are piling pressure on those who find themselves on the wrong side politically. High on Lopez Obrador\u2019s agenda before he leaves office is a list of reforms, many of which are expected to have a weakening effect on the day-in, day-out work of democratic institutions in the country, pointed out Zissis, the AS/COA editor. These include eliminating proportional representation of legislators, gutting of autonomous regulatory agencies, and direct election of Supreme Court justices. The ruling Morena party says such\u00a0measures are designed to create a more direct democracy, but critics say they will erode\u00a0checks and balances in the government. \u201cThese may seem like tedious questions but they have a real impact on the country\u2019s democracy and the ability of opposition parties to still have a voice,\u201d Zissis said. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum will begin her presidency on October 1. Widely seen as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lopez Obrador, whether she will continue in his footprints on security, border control and government reform are key questions amid historic levels of migration through North America. Sent back with little fanfare To reach Arizona, Norma\u2019s family took a flight to Hermosillo, and then a truck to a frontier town in the scorching Sonoran desert before eventually crossing the border on foot. She said they walked through dry scrub and mesquite trees for about 20 minutes before reaching a ditch filled with the\u00a0abandoned water bottles, diapers, ID cards and clothing \u2013 left\u00a0by the hundreds of migrants who had already reached the land of the free. Her children were protective as Norma stopped to chat with CNN, her 13-year-old worried that\u00a0people in Mexico would see her mother\u2019s picture on television. Even the two-year-old hugged her leg and pulled at her shirt, trying to hurry her along. \u201cMama,\u201d the toddler squeaked. \u201cVamos.\u201d But the tent at the end of the road would be a long walk for little legs. The temperature was 111 degrees Fahrenheit (43.8 Celsius). They would find no food, water, or air conditioning there \u2013 just dozens of other dazed looking families sprawled on the floor, waiting to be apprehended so that they could tell someone why they were there. For most people crossing that border\u00a0illegally\u00a0today, requesting asylum is no longer an option, no matter what their circumstances. US President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0proclamation\u00a0bars migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold of illegal crossings is met. Though asylum seekers can still use a Customs and Border Protection app to request an appointment to present their asylum claim at a port of entry. It\u2019s a controversial measure. Critics argue the change\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough\u00a0in stemming the vast numbers of people entering the country that far exceeds the capacity of US immigration systems. Immigrant\u00a0rights advocates warn closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0endangers\u00a0vulnerable people\u00a0and ultimately makes the\u00a0border\u00a0less safe. Norma and her kids were detained by Border Patrol on Friday after entering the US.\u00a0By Monday, they had been deported to Mexico, where she says they are afraid to leave the house, and her kids are not going to school. They were treated with respect by the US agents, she told CNN, who swabbed them for DNA \u2013 likely to ensure that the children were really hers. But she never got a chance to explain what she was running from, she said. \u201cThey just said that wasn\u2019t an option,\u201d she told CNN on Monday, speaking on the phone from her home in Mexico.

{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_armenia-withdraw-russia-alliance-azerbaijan-intl", "text": "Armenia will leave a Russia-led military alliance, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan confirmed Wednesday, accusing members of the bloc of plotting with bitter rival Azerbaijan to start a war against them. Pashinyan has for months accused the Kremlin\u2019s Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) of failing to protect Armenia from resurgent Azerbaijani aggression, threatening to leave the bloc if Moscow did not provide greater assurances and trying to cleave more closely to the United States and European Union. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought two wars over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, which Azerbaijan reclaimed in full by force in September. Russia has traditionally allied with Armenia, but their relations have soured in recent months while Moscow\u2019s ties to Azerbaijan have deepened. Speaking to parliamentarians in the capital Yerevan, Pashinyan said his country had \u201cfrozen\u201d its participation in the CSTO and would leave the bloc at a time of Armenia\u2019s choosing. \u201cWe will decide when we leave, but we will not go back,\u201d Pashinyan was quoted in state media Armenpress as saying. \u201cIt turned out that members of the alliance are not fulfilling their contractual obligations, but are planning a war with Azerbaijan against us.\u201d Pashinyan stopped short of naming the accused countries in the bloc, which includes Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and was founded in 1992 as the Soviet Union crumbled. The rupture in Armenia\u2019s relations with Russia comes after Azerbaijan retook Nagorno-Karabakh in a one-day war in September, sparking an exodus of virtually all of the Caucasian enclave\u2019s ethnic Armenian population, despite the presence there of Russian peacekeepers. Several Karabakh Armenians told CNN at the time that they felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by Russian peacekeepers who \u201cdid nothing\u201d to protect them, leaving them no choice but to abandon their homes and flee to Armenia proper. As more than 100,000 people took to the only road out of Karabakh, a billboard displaying the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin watched down over them. Some 2,000 Russian peacekeepers had deployed to Karabakh after a 44-day war in 2020, when Azerbaijan retook about a third of the enclave, in an offensive halted only by a Moscow-brokered ceasefire \u2013 which Azerbaijan would eventually breach three years later. When Russia\u2019s security guarantees proved hollow and Western support no more than rhetorical, Pashinyan \u2013 fearing an all-out war with Azerbaijan \u2013 declined to send Armenian military support to Karabakh, leaving the enclave\u2019s troops vastly outnumbered and with little choice but to surrender swiftly. Azerbaijan\u2019s President Ilham Aliyev had described retaking Karabakh as the \u201csacred goal\u201d of his presidency. Despite international condemnation of the exodus of Karabakh Armenians, which officials in Yerevan said amounted to ethnic cleansing, there was hope that this was the tragic price of putting an end to one of the world\u2019s most protracted conflicts. But a formal peace treaty has not been signed despite months of negotiations. In April, however, Armenia agreed to return four border villages to Azerbaijan, which both countries described as a major step toward a peace deal. Buoyed by recent progress, Pashinyan said Wednesday that Armenia is \u201cready to sign a peace agreement within a month,\u201d describing the terms of the deal as \u201cfully developed and ready to be finalized.\u201d But attempting to normalizing ties with Azerbaijan has stoked discontent at home, as protesters have accused Pashinyan of making unacceptable land concessions to Aliyev. Azerbaijan has also demanded that Armenia change its constitution to remove a reference to Karabakh independence, but Pashinyan has so far resisted the calls. In scenes reminiscent of those that propelled Pashinyan to power in 2018, protests erupted outside the parliament in Yerevan on Wednesday. Videos showed police using stun grenades to repel the crowds. More than 100 police officers and civilians were injured, Armenpress reported. The protests have been spearheaded by Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, who has for months called for Pashinyan\u2019s resignation. \u201cThe problem is very simple: this man must leave, there is no other option,\u201d Galstanyan wrote Wednesday on social media. While Pashinyan has not yet specified when Armenia will leave the CSTO, the last of the Russian peacekeepers who had been deployed to Karabakh completed their withdrawal on Wednesday, Azerbaijan\u2019s defense ministry said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/armenia-withdraw-russia-alliance-azerbaijan-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "travel_article_confessions-1980s-flight-attendant", "text": "\u201cI came of age when the jet age came of age,\u201d says Ann Hood, an American novelist and New York Times best-selling author, whose book \u201cFly Girl\u201d is a memoir of her adventurous years as a TWA flight attendant, right at the end of the Golden Age of air travel. As a child, growing up in Virginia, she witnessed the first flight of the Boeing 707 \u2013 which ushered in the era of passenger jet travel \u2013 and watched Dulles airport being built. At the age of 11, after she moved back to her native Rhode Island with her family, she read a 1964 book titled \u201cHow to become an airline stewardess,\u201d and her mind was made up. \u201cAlthough it was sexist as hell, it enticed me because it talked about having a job that allowed you to see the world and I thought, well, that might work.\u201d When she graduated from college, in 1978, Hood started sending job applications to airlines. \u201cI think 1978 was a really interesting year, because many of the women I went to college with had one foot in old ideas and stereotypes, and the other foot in the future. It was kind of a confusing time for young women.\u201d \u201cFlight attendant\u201d was a newly minted term, a gender neutral upgrade from \u201chostesses\u201d and \u201cstewardesses,\u201d and deregulation of the airline industry was around the corner, ready to shake things up.  But for the most part, flying was still glamorous and sophisticated and flight attendants were still \u201cbeautiful and sexy ornaments,\u201d as Hood puts it, although they were already fighting for women\u2019s rights and against discrimination.  The stereotype of stewardesses in miniskirts flirting with male passengers still endured, popularized by books like \u201cCoffee, tea, or me? The uninhibited memoirs of two airline stewardesses\u201d \u2013 published as factual in 1967, but later revealed to have been written by Donald Bain, an American Airlines PR executive. Weight limits Some of the worst requirements to be hired as a flight attendant \u2013 such as age restrictions and losing the job in case of marriage or childbirth \u2013 had already been lifted, but others remained. The most shocking one, perhaps, was the fact that women had to maintain the weight they had at the time of hiring.  \u201cAll airlines sent a chart with your application, you looked at your height and the maximum weight and if you did not fall within that, they wouldn\u2019t even interview you,\u201d says Hood. \u201cBut once you got hired, at least at TWA, you couldn\u2019t go up to that maximum weight. You had to stay at your hiring weight, which in my case was about 15 pounds less than my maximum limit.  \u201cMy roommate got fired over this. The really terrible thing about it, other than what it did to women, is that this restriction was not removed until the 1990s.\u201d Hood was one of 560 flight attendants, out of 14,000 applicants, hired in 1978 by TWA, then a major carrier, acquired by American Airlines in 2001.  The job started with a few days of intense training in Kansas City, where cadet flight attendants would learn everything from aircraft part names to emergency medical procedures, as well as the safety protocols of seven different aircraft. The list included the Queen of the Skies, the Boeing 747. \u201cIt was kind of terrifying, because it was so big \u2013 and the stairs, the spiral stairs that led to first class that you had to go up and down not infrequently,\u201d says Hood. \u201cI would keep thinking: don\u2019t trip. Eventually I got used to it.\u201d  Carving chateaubriand She says her favorite plane to work on was the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. \u201cDomestically, only Eastern Airlines and TWA flew it. It was a very approachable, workable widebody plane with a lovely setup of two seats on each side and then four seats in the middle, so everybody could get out easily. Nobody was unhappy on that plane.\u201d Flying was still glamorous at the time, she says. \u201cPeople dressed up to fly and remembered the food in a good way. It\u2019s really different from today. I can only compare it to being in a fine hotel, or maybe on a cruise ship. Nothing was plastic and coach was super nice,\u201d says Hood, who remembers donning her Ralph Lauren-designed uniform and carving chateaubriand cooked to taste for first class passengers, who also had a choice of Russian caviar and lobster bisque to go with their Dom Perignon.  It wasn\u2019t all a bed of roses. Smoking on board was widespread, and for flight attendants it was a nightmare. \u201cIf you went on a five-day trip, which wasn\u2019t uncommon, you had to pack a separate whole uniform because you just would smell so much like smoke,\u201d Hood says. \u201cBoy, was I glad when that stopped. The front rows of each section were deemed non-smoking, but the whole plane was filled with smoke because you couldn\u2019t keep it from going backwards, it was ridiculous.\u201d What about the Mile High Club? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t uncommon on international flights to see a man go into the bathroom and a minute later his seatmate join him, or some version of that,\u201d says Hood. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen on every flight, but you saw it.  \u201cInternational flights usually weren\u2019t as full as they are now, so in those middle sections of five seats on a 747 you could see a couple put the armrests up, take a blanket and disappear under it. I can\u2019t say what they were doing, but it looked suspicious.\u201d As for passengers flirting or asking flight attendants out, it was also common. \u201cI did date passengers, but that was mostly disastrous. It was never what I had imagined. But in 1982, I met a guy on a flight from San Francisco to New York. He was sitting in 47F \u2013 and I dated him for five years.\u201d An empowering job Hood has seen her fair share of bizarre things on board. \u201cThe weirdest would definitely be the woman in first class who appeared to be breastfeeding her cat. I mean, I can\u2019t say that it was actually happening, but she had her cat to her breast.  \u201cAnd then the guy who flew the whole way in his tighty-whities and his dress shirt and tie, because he didn\u2019t want to wrinkle his pants for a job interview. Or the guy on a 747 in Frankfurt who was riding his bicycle down the aisle,\u201d she reveals. That said, the routine would sometimes kick in, and not every flight was a wondrous concentrate of adventure and glamor. \u201cI would say the job was 80% fun and 20% boring. In some flights, especially those that weren\u2019t very full, there was a lot of time to fill. You can only serve people so much food and so many drinks, and play so many movies. I made the job fun. I loved talking to people. I loved the feel of it. I still love flying today,\u201d says Hood. She says it was indeed possible to actually visit and experience the cities she traveled to. \u201cSometimes your layover was really short or you were just tired, but for the most part, the city was right out the door. I very much took advantage of that when flying internationally.\u201d She left the job to focus on her writing career in 1986, and by that time things had changed. Deregulation, which removed federal control over everything from fares to routes, had come fully into effect, changing flying forever.  Planes became filled with more seats and coach stopped being as pleasant, but flying was also democratized and made available to a far larger share of society.  Hood says she is proud of her career in the skies.  \u201cFlight attendants are a force. They\u2019re highly unionized. They\u2019re independent. In the cabin, they make all the decisions. They have to troubleshoot. They\u2019re there for the emergency stuff. They land in cities where they don\u2019t know anything or anyone and find their way.  \u201cIt\u2019s such an empowering job, yet it\u2019s a sexist job. In itself, it is as contradictory today as the time in which I started it,\u201d she says.  Nevertheless, she recommends it as a career option.  \u201cI was 21 when I was hired, and it gave me confidence, it gave me poise, and the ability to think on my feet,\u201d she adds. \u201cTo take charge on that airplane, and once I got off, to walk into a city and feel completely at home \u2013 or at least figure out how to feel at home in it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it should be someone\u2019s life\u2019s work \u2013 if they want it to be that, great. But I think a few years working as a flight attendant could change your life.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/confessions-1980s-flight-attendant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_weather_friday-flooding-rain-storm-south-florida", "text": "Heavy rainfall that\u2019s caused unrelenting flooding in South Florida since Tuesday is drenching the state for a fourth consecutive day Friday. The days of deadly, torrential storms have turned roads into canals and forced some residents to stand on the roofs of their cars or trudge through waist-deep waters. Two people were killed in a weather-related vehicle crash late Wednesday afternoon southeast of Fort Myers, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Identified only as a 35-year-old woman and a 25-year-old-man, the two died after their vehicle \u201clost control due to weather\u201d conditions and crashed into opposing traffic, the FHP said. Two others were injured in the crash. Since heavy rain started swamping the region Tuesday, the flooding has become waist-deep in some places. Hazardous conditions on streets and roadways have stranded drivers and made roads impassable. And they\u2019ve forced some schools in hard-hit counties to shutter and hundreds of flights to be canceled or delayed. With tropical moisture still streaming over South Florida, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a level 3 of 4 flood threat Friday \u2013 just one level lower than the rare high risk of excessive rainfall seen Thursday. Robust tropical moisture fueling the soaking storms slowly starts to shift out of the area over the weekend, but Friday marks yet another drenching day for South Florida. By week\u2019s end, multiple cities could see more than 2 feet of rain. \u201cEven moderate rain rates are likely to cause additional flash flooding, as any rainfall will be unable to drain\u201d due to ongoing flooding, the WPC warned Friday. Flood watches remain in effect for over 7 million people across South Florida, including in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, through Friday evening. An additional 2 to 4 inches or more of rainfall is expected through Friday night. Thunderstorm activity is expected to diminish over the weekend, but any rain Saturday or early Sunday could worsen ongoing flooding issues. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties, and officials have urged locals to stay at home instead of walking or driving through the floodwater, which has covered streets and seeped into homes. Many cities have been distributing sandbags to residents to help combat the rising floodwaters. Flooding brought back familiar dangers for Florida residents With flooding from the rainfall deluging South Florida since Tuesday morning, footage on social media has shown water levels in the area reaching to vehicles\u2019 windows and filling up parking decks and neighborhood streets. Notably, many South Florida residents had just finished repairing their homes after\u00a0catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps this week. In Miami, video showed stranded cars that were nearly entirely submerged under water. One area family\u2019s yard looked like a lake as belongings floated outside and were pulled from the standing water, according to CNN affiliate WSVN. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d 11-year-old Somaya Ferdinand told WSVN as she waded through thigh-high water outside her home in Northeast Miami-Dade. \u201cIt looked like a swimming pool.\u201d And in Hallandale Beach, just north of Miami, footage showed one man kayaking among cars as high waters flooded parts of the city. Some mobile home parks were underwater, said Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Michael Kane. Severe flooding there on Wednesday covered cars up to their windshields, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety. Others had to be rescued. \u201cWe had to use our boats to rescue people standing on top of the roofs of cars,\u201d Kane told CNN.

{"id": "2024_06_14_africa_south-africa-governing-alliance-emerges-intl", "text": "The African National Congress and its staunchest adversary, the White-led, Democratic Alliance, forged an unprecedented alliance Friday, agreeing to collaborate in South Africa\u2019s new government of national unity, a stunning turn of events that ends 30 years of ANC political dominance. \u201cAfter two weeks of thorough negotiations that only concluded after today\u2019s sitting of Parliament had already started, the DA has reached agreement on the statement of intent for the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU),\u201d the DA\u2019s leader John Steenhuisen said in a statement in Cape Town on Friday. The respective parties involved include the ANC, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the DA, Steenhuisen outlined in his statement. \u201cToday, the 14th of June 2024 will go down in the annals of history as the start of a new chapter for our beloved country,\u201d Steenhuisen said. The DA, a broadly centrist and pro-business party, is seen as the official opposition to the ANC, and has been heavily critical of the ANC for years. \u201cIt is difficult to overstate just how significant this moment is for the Democratic Alliance,\u201d Steenhuisen said, adding that the party will \u201cgovern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration.\u201d \u201cThanks to the 3.5 million people who voted for us, the DA will no longer only be an opposition party at a national level. Instead, the DA now becomes the second biggest party inside a multi-party national government,\u201d the DA leader added. No party managed to win an outright majority in South Africa\u2019s election last month. Support for the ANC dropped to 40.18%,\u00a0a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election in 2019. The DA party received 21.8% of the vote. Former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s newly-formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) had nearly 14.59% of the vote. Another ANC splinter party \u2013 the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 had nearly 10%, with results at 9.52% The ANC\u2019s Secretary General Fikile Mbalula said on Thursday the party had reached a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d with political parties in coalition negotiations during a press conference on Thursday in Cape Town. The announcement comes as the newly elected parliament was convening for the first time and lawmakers were in the process of being sworn in. \u201cToday marks the beginning of a new era where we put our differences aside and unite for the betterment of all South Africans,\u201d wrote Sihle Zikalala, of the ANC\u2019s governing body, in a post on X. Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC leader, will remain the country\u2019s president under the deal, according to a report on the TimesLive news website.

{"id": "2024_06_09_europe_macron-dissolves-french-parliament-europe-intl", "text": "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron has dissolved the country\u2019s parliament, the National Assembly, and called a snap election after an exit poll showed his Renaissance party is set to be trounced by the far-right opposition in European parliamentary elections on Sunday. After initial projections, the far-right National Rally (RN) party came out on top with 31.5% of the vote, more than double the share of Renaissance, which scraped into second place on 15.2% of the vote, just ahead of the Socialists in third with 14.3% of the vote. In a celebratory speech after the publication of the exit poll, RN leader Jordan Bardella had called on Macron to dissolve the French parliament, calling the gap between the two parties a \u201cstinging disavowal\u201d for the president. \u201cThis unprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era,\u201d Bardella told a raucous audience at RN\u2019s headquarters. Within an hour, Macron made a national address, announcing he would dissolve the French lower house and hold parliamentary elections. The first round will be held on June 30, with a second round on July 7, Macron said. \u201cI have decided to give you back the choice of your parliamentary future by voting. I am therefore dissolving the National Assembly this evening,\u201d Macron said in the shock announcement. \u201cThis decision is serious, heavy. But it is above all, an act of trust. Trust in you, my dear compatriots. In the capacity of the French people to make the most just decision,\u201d the French president added. Under the French system, parliamentary elections are held to elect the 577 members of the lower house, the National Assembly. Separate elections are held to choose the country\u2019s president, which are not scheduled again until 2027. In the last set of parliamentary elections held in 2022, the Ensemble coalition including Macron\u2019s Renaissance party fell short of an overall majority and were forced to seek help from elsewhere. Speaking after Macron\u2019s announcement, Marine Le Pen \u2013 who ran unsuccessfully against Macron for the French presidency in 2017 and 2022, but whose RN party has since enjoyed a resurgence in the polls \u2013 said she welcomed his decision to hold elections. \u201cWe are ready to take power if the French place their trust in us,\u201d said Le Pen, now the parliamentary leader of RN. \u201cWe are ready to rebuild the country, ready to defend the interests of the French, ready to put an end to mass immigration, ready to make the purchasing power of the French a priority, ready to begin the reindustrialization of the country,\u201d she said. Since the beginning of his second term in 2022, Macron has been ruling with a relative majority, forcing him to invoke Article 49.3 of the French constitution several times \u2013 pushing legislation through parliament without a vote, to the increasing displeasure of opposition lawmakers and much of the French public. The last time a French president dissolved parliament was in 1997, which led to Jacques Chirac losing his majority and ushering the Socialists into power under Lionel Jospin. An \u00c9lys\u00e9e source close to Macron, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN the predicted results showed there is a \u201crepublican majority\u201d in France made up of those who \u201cdon\u2019t agree with the far-right ideas.\u201d \u201cWe should never be afraid of the French people,\u201d the source said. \u201cConvince, convince, convince \u2013 that is the spirit that the presidential majority will take up.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/europe/macron-dissolves-french-parliament-europe-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_brazil-pantanal-wetland-fires-intl-latam", "text": "Brazil\u2019s Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland on earth, is ablaze, with fires in June breaking historical records for that month. While aerial views of the wetland show smoke rising and the bright orange of burning fires, a closer look at burnt vegetation found charred skeletons of wildlife, including an alligator, monkey and snake, photos from Reuters showed earlier this week. Brazil\u2019s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has detected 733 fires in the Pantanal biome so far this month, with the previous record for fires in Pantanal for June being 435 registered in 2005. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which encompasses 60% of the Brazilian Pantanal, is under a \u201cdanger\u201d warning for a heat wave expected to hit with temperatures 5\u00baC higher than average for the next three to five days, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET). The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) Brazil has warned that the entire year of 2024 could become the worst year on record for the Pantanal as the dry season is just beginning, and the number of fires this year already represents an increase of 898% compared to the same period in 2023, according to INPE\u2019s data. \u201cIt is necessary to act quickly reinforcing [fire] brigades and counting with the support of the local communities to avoid a catastrophe\u201d, said Cynthia Santos, conservation analyst for WWF Brazil, in a statement. What to know about the wetlands The Pantanal\u2019s distinctive habitats rely on what scientists call the \u201cflood pulse.\u201d During the wet season between November and March, three quarters of the plain gets flooded, only for much of the water to drain away during the dry months, from April to September. This seasonal flooding makes the Pantanal a unique biome where large swaths of land regularly turn from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and back again. Wetlands like the Pantanal are Earth\u2019s most effective carbon sinks \u2013 ecosystems that absorb and store more carbon than they release, keeping it away from the atmosphere. At roughly 200,000 square kilometers, the Pantanal comprises about 3% of the globe\u2019s wetlands and plays a key role in the carbon cycle. When these carbon-rich ecosystems burn, vast amounts of heat-trapping gases are released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (known as the World Wildlife Fund in the US and Canada), the Pantanal boasts the greatest concentration of wildlife in South America \u2013 higher than that of its more famous northern neighbor, the Amazon. \u201cThe Pantanal is very important for the planet, it has unique wild areas that are fundamental to life on Earth,\u201d said Andre Luiz Siqueira, the CEO of ECOA, an environmental NGO based in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, speaking to CNN in 2020. The area is home to thousands of endangered or unusual species, including jaguars, capybaras, black caimans, giant otters and hyacinth macaws. It\u2019s also an important stop on the routes of around 180 species of migratory birds. The wetland is facing a \u201chydrological crisis scenario\u201d due to an intense drought. The lack of rain began in 2023 and has been aggravated by the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, according to ECOA. Occasional wildfires are normal in the Pantanal, so much so that some plants in the region developed resistance to fires \u2013 for example by growing thick bark or covering their seeds with hard shells. In 2020, the fires destroyed unique habitats and wrecked the livelihoods of many of the Pantanal\u2019s diverse indigenous communities.

{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam", "text": "The execution of banana plantation worker \u201cDavid\u201d\u00a0by right-wing Colombian paramilitary\u00a0members\u00a0in 1997 was as swift as it was brutal. Minutes after his bus was\u00a0stopped at a checkpoint in the coastal region of Urab\u00e1, he was dragged off, beaten to death in front of his fellow passengers, and dumped on the side of the road \u2013 where his killers covered his corpse with a\u00a0banana plant.\u00a0Cows would later feed on his body, according to court documents. The brutality did not end there. His\u00a0daughter and\u00a0sister-in-law\u00a0disappeared weeks later, never to be found again. Death threats were made to another member of the family. What was left of the family soon left Urab\u00e1 for good. He\u00a0was just one of thousands of people targeted by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, an infamous right-wing terrorist group that, at the height of Colombia\u2019s civil conflict around the turn of the century, was able to mobilize tens of thousands of fighters. More than a quarter century\u00a0later, a landmark civil case in a US federal court this week found banana company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing the\u00a0paramilitary\u00a0group, and ordered Chiquita\u00a0to pay $38.3 million in compensation to \u201cDavid\u2019s\u201d family and those of\u00a0seven other victims \u2013 whose real identities were concealed in court documents. The details of those deaths, which took place between 1997 and 2004, and accounts of\u00a0the impact they had on the families, were read to jurors before\u00a0they deliberated whether Chiquita \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest banana producers \u2013 had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson\u201d by paying the AUC what the company characterized as extortion payments. The families\u00a0argued\u00a0that\u00a0payments from Chiquita to the AUC had helped to prop up the paramilitary group\u2019s violence in Colombia and that the company should therefore be held liable for the group\u2019s murders. The verdict\u00a0has been celebrated as a legal breakthrough.\u00a0According to the lawyers who won the case in Florida, it marks \u201cthe first time an American jury has held a major US corporation accountable for complicity in serious human rights abuses in another country.\u201d \u201cI feel great joy, we waited for so long and suddenly, we won. I had almost lost hope, but God helped us,\u201d one of the plaintiffs told CNN after the ruling. The mother of four daughters\u00a0recalled telling\u00a0the court how her partner\u00a0was\u00a0killed by AUC paramilitaries on November 14, 2003, to pressure the family to sell a banana plantation at below market rate. \u201cI don\u2019t want the money myself, I\u2019ll be gone soon\u2026 but at least, for the girls: may they get some justice now!\u201d she said of the compensation. A bellwether case? The verdict follows a nearly two-decade judicial fight by the families, who sued Chiquita International after a separate court case in 2007.\u00a0In\u00a0that case,\u00a0the company admitted paying $1.7 million in \u201cprotection money\u201d to the AUC \u2013 at that time considered a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department \u2013 and agreed to pay the US government a $25 million fine. However, it\u2019s unlikely to be the last of the matter, and not only because Chiquita has already said it will appeal the verdict. Marco Simons, general counsel for Earth Rights International, a human rights NGO that provided legal assistance to the victims, described his legal strategy as a \u201cbellwether process,\u201d with his team selecting the nine strongest cases they had from over 4,500 complaints. He now hopes many more cases will follow. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to represent these victims for the past 17 years. It\u2019s not over yet, but this is a significant step forward, and we hope that this will pave the way for compensation for all the victims,\u201d Simons told a press conference in Washington on Tuesday. Because of Chiquita\u2019s appeal, Simons says it is unlikely any of the victims will receive compensation soon, however, he says the case has sent a strong message to corporations about the need to respect human rights. \u201cUltimately, this money is not going to replace what\u2019s been lost. We\u2019re still talking about horrific abuses that these families have suffered, but the money is important because, unfortunately, the language that corporations understand best is money. Sometimes it takes a significant monetary penalty to change corporate behavior,\u201d Simons said. \u2018Tragic for so many\u2019 Chiquita has maintained in its defense \u2013 both throughout the latest case and in previous litigation \u2013 that it was itself a victim, as it had been forced to pay the AUC protection money. While that argument was not enough to\u00a0convince\u00a0the jury that it had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson would have acted under the circumstances,\u201d the company told CNN following the latest verdict that it remained \u201cconfident that our legal position will ultimately prevail.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Colombia was tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families. However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\u201d the statement read. In its 2007 case against the US Justice Department, the company\u00a0admitted making more than \u201c100 payments to the AUC totaling over $1.7 million.\u201d\u00a0Chiquita recorded the AUC payments as \u201csecurity services,\u201d though the company never received any actual services from these payments,\u00a0according\u00a0to a US Justice Department press release from the time. Eric Holder, who represented Chiquita in the 2007 trial before serving as US Attorney General under President\u00a0Barack Obama, told the court then\u00a0that: \u201cThe company had to pay a variety of terrorist groups for over 15 years because those were the groups that controlled the areas in which the company operated. Not the Colombian government.\u201d However, in that trial, the company ended up admitting in a plea deal that it had willingly continued to pay the AUC even after the group was declared a terrorist organization by the US government in 2001, and even after a senior director lodged an objection to Chiquita\u2019s board reiterating \u201chis strong opinion to sell our operations in Colombia,\u201d due to the protection money issue. Federal attorneys found that Chiquita made $49.4 million in profit from their Colombian operations between 1997 and 2004. A time of \u2018real terror\u2019 The AUC was founded in 1997, during one of the most tragic phases of the Colombian civil conflict, which saw the government wrestle for control against left-wing guerrilla forces, right-wing paramilitaries, and criminal organizations. Around that time, left-wing guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) were moving against the state and terrorizing the civilian population.\u00a0Chiquita said in the 2007 case that it had paid ransoms to the FARC and ELN\u00a0before it turned to the AUC in 1997. Faced with the possibility of an armed communist revolution in the country, Colombian landowners and right-wing sympathizers created groups of\u00a0vigilantes\u00a0to respond to the guerrillas blow for blow. The AUC were once such a\u00a0group and spent the years before their final demobilization\u00a0in 2006 terrorizing the population of northern Colombia to stem the rebellion. At its zenith, the AUC could mobilize tens of thousands of fighters, and was heavily financed by drug trafficking: following demobilization, more than a dozen AUC leaders were extradited on drug charges to the US. \u201cI remember that period, it was real terror,\u201d one of the plaintiffs awarded compensation on Monday told CNN. \u201cMy husband was killed, but my daughter was also raped, you had victims all across town.\u201d In other testimony heard by the jurors in the most recent court case, a minor\u00a0girl\u00a0was forced to watch from a taxi as her mother and stepfather were executed on the side of the street, before being given the equivalent of less than a dollar to return home and survive as an orphan. Colombia today Colombia today is a vastly different country to the one in which the AUC was born. A few years after the demobilization of the AUC, a peace deal in 2016 also brought to an end the 52-year conflict between the government and the FARC, though some dissidents continue to fight. Both right wing paramilitaries and left-wing guerrillas have since been included in transitional justice processes aimed at bringing closure to some of the darkest pages of the conflict. Yet the fear in Urab\u00e1 remains. Some of the AUC\u2019s former members remain at large and have joined a new organized criminal group, the Gulf Clan, that challenges government control in northwestern Colombia. Rights groups say powerful corporate interests continue to collude with local politicians and criminal groups to repress activism, particularly in defense of the environment, which can be a dangerous business in South America. Even so, for at least some of the many victims of the AUC, this week\u2019s court verdict is a reason for optimism.\u00a0One of the plaintiffs who spoke with CNN asked to share her message as an act of defiance. \u201cMy daughter, my son, they\u2019re all \u2018Mom don\u2019t pick up the phone, mom don\u2019t talk.\u2019 But hey, fear can only last until someone decides to speak,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_ukraine-prison-soldier-recruitment-intl-cmd", "text": "Battalion commander Dmytro Kukharchuk speaks quietly but firmly. Holding his tattooed hands behind his back, he tells the men \u2013 all convicts \u2013 about his experience fighting for Ukraine in Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Kukharchuk, 34, is at a prison in central Ukraine, trying to recruit physically strong, healthy and motivated prisoners into\u00a0his\u00a0unit, the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade. More than two years on from Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, Ukraine is struggling to replenish its depleted military ranks. To address this, the government\u00a0introduced a new law\u00a0last month permitting the recruitment of convicts. It allows individuals who meet certain conditions to be granted conditional early release if they sign a contract to serve in the military. Kukharchuk doesn\u2019t promise the prisoners much. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy. But when you come to us, you come to a family,\u201d he tells the men, explaining that the brigade will not have any special \u201cpenal\u201d units. Instead, he says, the recruited prisoners will be integrated into the existing battalions. Some of the men listen attentively, others smirk. But even those who smirk start paying attention when Kukharchuk\u2019s colleague starts speaking. The man, who asked CNN to identify him only by his call sign \u201cDato\u201d because of privacy concerns, is one of them. He has spent much of his life behind bars. Convicted of various crimes, he escaped from prison three times and was paroled in February 2022 after serving 31 years. He joined the Ukrainian army just hours after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Dato, 58, commands respect from his audience. His voice cuts through the yard and when he pauses, the silence is heavy. Dozens of prisoners hang on his every word. Some are standing outside in the yard; others are leaning out of the windows of their cells. \u00a0His speech is peppered with prison slang. He speaks of honor, duty, and reputation. \u201cThis is your chance to rehabilitate yourself in the eyes of your children,\u201d he tells them. Recruiters from several brigades have already visited this prison of 700 men, and about 100 inmates have already signed contracts with different units. The new law does not allow the recruitment of people convicted of crimes against the foundations of national security of Ukraine, or of particularly serious corruption offenses. Those who committed the most violent offenses are also excluded. People convicted of two or more premeditated murders, of crimes committed with cruelty, or of murders combined with rape or sexual violence, are barred from signing up. How exactly the law will work in practice remains to be seen. After it was passed, Ukraine\u2019s Justice Ministry said the inmates, who must sign up of their own free will, would serve in separate units. But Kukharchuk and Dato, representing the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade, would like to have the prison recruits serve with regular infantry. Kukharchuk told CNN the soldiers from his brigade have no issues with fighting alongside convicts. \u201cHow can you have a special attitude towards people who come to you, who will sit in the same trench with you, who will participate in assault operations with you and have your back?\u201d he said. But other commanders, while supportive of convicts\u2019 recruitment, are not so sure about integration. \u201cPrisoners should fight in separate units. And they need very good people to lead them,\u201d one commander, who goes by the call sign \u201cTeren\u201d and is fighting in Avdiivka, told CNN. The artillery reconnaissance commander with the 110th Mechanized Brigade asked for his real name not to be used for security reasons. \u201cI am not against prisoners fighting at all. I\u2019m surprised that we didn\u2019t use this idea at the beginning of the war. There are always a lot of casualties among the infantry, and if the convicts want to (risk their lives) to go to fight in the infantry, it\u2019s a good decision,\u201d he added. The push to recruit inmates into the military appears at first glance to parallel a campaign of prison recruitment by Russia\u2019s mercenary company Wagner early in the war,\u00a0and continued by the Ministry of Defense since last year.\u00a0The lives of thousands of Russian convicts have been expended in so-called\u00a0\u201cmeat grinder\u201d assaults, particularly in the fighting for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. But Ukraine\u2019s Minister of Justice Denys Maliuska, speaking to CNN in Kyiv, rejected the comparison. \u201cIn Ukraine, motivation is largely based on patriotism. Our prisoners join the army voluntarily. In Russia, it was voluntary and forced. I personally saw (Russian) prisoners who were forced to join Wagner,\u201d he said, adding that in Russia, inmates were recruited into the notoriously brutal private military company, whereas in Ukraine, they are joining the Armed Forces of Ukraine. \u201cThis is a regular state military service with all the guarantees: salary, social insurance, payments in case of injury, death, and so on. This is a completely different story in terms of motives and mechanisms.\u201d Shaking off the \u2018ex-prisoner\u2019 label The convict recruits will be allowed the same family leave as other soldiers and will be entitled to the same salary but won\u2019t receive the annual leave that is standard for other troops, according to the law. According to the Ministry of Justice, 26,000 people are currently in prison in Ukraine. Since the law came into effect, 5,000 male inmates have applied to join the military, the ministry says. Nearly 2,000 have already passed their medical examination and been released from prison into the military by the courts. The first tranche of prisoner recruits is already in basic training, according to Maliuska. The minister said he expected more convicts to sign up. Many are waiting to see what happens to the first round of recruits, he said, but the initial reaction has been positive. Maliuska believes many prisoners see the program as a chance to shake off the \u201cex-prisoner\u201d label that tends to stick to people even after their release. \u201cThere are definitely risks. But the morale and mood of those who are released from prison are much higher than that of those who were mobilized somewhere on the street,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cA person forcibly mobilized who did not want to go to the army sees it as a tragedy, and a deterioration in his living conditions. And you can expect desertion from this category (of soldiers) much more than from a person for whom it is a rise in the social ladder, income, lifestyle, and respect. For prisoners, it is a rise in the social ladder.\u201d The minister told CNN the government knows\u00a0that prisoners might present challenges to commanders on the ground, but he said the law can be tweaked as needed depending on how things look in practice. A lot will depend on unit commanders and their ability to establish discipline in the prisoner units, he said. \u2018I will now protect other families\u2019 At a training ground in central Ukraine, a group of prisoners is already into the second week of basic training. Among them is 28-year-old Dmytro, whose wife and two young children were killed by a Russian strike in the eastern city of Izium just weeks into the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while he was serving a four-and-a-half-year term in prison. He asked CNN not to publish his last name for security reasons. Dmytro told CNN he knew he wanted to fight from the moment the war started. When the recruiters visited his prison, he was among the first to sign up. \u201cI had a wife and children, and I knew someone had to protect them. But since I couldn\u2019t, I will now protect other families who want to live and have children,\u201d he told CNN. Dmytro told CNN that he grew up as an orphan and started stealing when he was young. He said that he believes prison teaches people how to survive in a tough environment, which means that former prisoners might be able to handle the pressures of the front lines better than ordinary civilians. He told CNN that when his family was killed, he wanted revenge. He cannot bear to talk about those he lost now, but dreams of the day he might be able to start afresh and have children who would be proud of him. \u201cI have a year and five months left of my sentence. That is not much. I could stay in prison and not go to war. But I am motivated. I don\u2019t want other people to go through this,\u201d he said, referring to the loss of his family. Back at the prison,\u00a0Kukharchuk and Dato select their recruits carefully. Sitting across from them in an interview room, they ask each of the volunteers about their background and their motivation. The brigade does not accept those who are over 50 years old, have any serious health problems or are physically unfit. Orphans, on the other hand, are immediately favored. Kukharchuk told CNN that orphans who have had a difficult childhood and are used to surviving and coping with difficulties tend to do well in the military. After each interview, the prisoners shake hands with the recruiters. Those selected fill out paperwork then await further instructions. Of the 17 inmates who wanted to join on the day CNN visited the prison, the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade recruited 12. Kukharchuk said that was \u201ca very good number\u201d. \u00a0The brigade is one of the most highly sought-after units and it usually rejects more than half of the convicts wanting to join it. There are exceptions to the rules. One of the prisoners has poor eyesight and Dato and Kukharchuk at first hesitate to recruit him. After a short chat though, the man is accepted. \u201cEyesight can be corrected. Motivation is more important than eyesight,\u201d says Dato.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/ukraine-prison-soldier-recruitment-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_middleeast_hezbollah-lebanon-israel-tensions-explainer-update-intl", "text": "Israel and the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah have been ramping up cross-border attacks after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. With both sides trading fire for more than eight months, experts say Israel feels it can no longer ignore its northern front or delay taking action there. A full-blown war appears to have become more likely \u2013 even if both sides have no desire for one, analysts believe. Here\u2019s what we know: Why are Israel and Hezbollah fighting? Lebanon and Israel have officially been in a state of war for decades. Israel launched a devastating invasion of Lebanon in 1982, sending tanks all the way to the capital Beirut,\u00a0after coming under attack from Palestinian militants in the country. It then occupied southern Lebanon for 22 years until it was driven out by Hezbollah, which emerged from the rubble of the Israeli invasion. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Lebanese movement with one of the region\u2019s most powerful paramilitary forces. The \u201cresistance\u201d group is tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Since then, the two sides have traded fire sporadically, but tensions boiled over in 2006 when Israel went to war in southern Lebanon again after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers. More than 1,000 Lebanese were killed in that conflict, mostly civilians, as well as 49 Israeli civilians and 121 soldiers. Two years later, Hezbollah returned the remains of the kidnapped soldiers in exchange for the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as the bodies of militants Israel was holding. The latest hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah started after Hamas led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250, according to Israeli authorities. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has levelled much of the territory and killed more than 37,000 Palestinians. Hezbollah has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. The military capability of the Lebanese group has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Today, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. Why are tensions flaring up now? The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has been gradually intensifying since October 7, said Heiko Wimmen, project director for Iraq, Syria and Lebanon at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. It\u2019s a \u201cslow-motion escalation\u201d that \u201cinches upwards,\u201d he said. But both sides have come closer to war of late as clashes across the border have grown in number and scale. \u201cThere is clearly an escalation,\u201d said Wimmen, particularly in terms of deaths on each side of the border and the type of weaponry Hezbollah has been deploying. An Israeli reservist was killed in a Hezbollah strike on a village in northern Israel last week, bringing the total number of soldiers killed on the Israeli side to 19. Israel killed one of Hezbollah\u2019s most senior commanders, Talib Sami Abdulla, in a strike on southern Lebanon this week. The IDF said the commander was responsible for multiple attacks against Israeli civilians over several years. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched more than\u00a0200 rockets toward Israel on Wednesday and a significant but smaller barrage on Thursday. Israel and Hezbollah have also been striking much deeper into each other\u2019s territory than they were at the beginning of the war, when fighting was confined to a roughly 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) radius of the border on either side. Hezbollah has fired 35 kilometers into Israel, while Israel has targeted areas of Lebanon more than 120 kilometers north. Cross-border attacks from Lebanon in early June led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region,\u00a0which Israel attributed to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. Amal Saad, a lecturer at Cardiff University and an expert on Hezbollah, said the group\u2019s escalation \u201cis a marked departure from prior flare-ups that have occurred since October 8.\u201d \u201cThis stage transcends merely responding to Israeli attacks and restoring deterrence; it involves conveying new messages and strategies,\u201d Saad wrote on X on June 5. The conflict has become \u201cvery visible\u201d and \u201cdifficult to ignore,\u201d said Wimmen, of the International Crisis Group, adding that Israeli officials feel compelled to respond, or at least be seen as responding, amid pressure to react from far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. There is a push within government and the Israeli army to take action in the north, Ronni Shaked, a scholar at the Truman Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told CNN. \u201cNobody can live in this situation.\u201d New weapons at play The cross-border conflict has seen new weapons come into the mix. In an escalatory development on June 8, Hezbollah said it fired a salvo of Falaq 2 rockets at a military site in northern Israel. This was the first time the group had deployed the weapon, which is an improved version of the Falaq 1 rocket that Hezbollah has used throughout the conflict. An Iranian-made rocket, the Falaq 2 has a longer range and carries a larger warhead than its predecessor. An Iranian-made rocket, the Falaq 2 has a longer range and carries a larger warhead than its predecessor. Israeli soldiers on the border with Lebanon have also used a catapult rarely used by military forces since the 16th century. The trebuchet, a rotating arm with a sling attached to launch a projectile, was used to launch fireballs from Israel toward Lebanese territory, likely to burn shrubbery to make it easier for Israeli forces to identify militants. Israeli public broadcaster and CNN affiliate Kan on Thursday reported that the IDF had said the catapult was \u201ca local initiative\u201d and had not \u201ccome into widespread use.\u201d What are both sides saying? Rhetoric has been fiery from both sides, but experts say neither side wants a full-blown conflict. Netanyahu in December warned that Beirut would turn into Gaza if Hezbollah chose to start an all-out war. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich last week poured cold water on the prospect of a wider war, saying the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d During his visit to the northern city of Kiryat Shmona near the Lebanese border last week, Netanyahu said Israel was prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera that the group had assessed that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah will end its attacks on Israel once the war in Gaza stops. Is a full-blown war likely? Experts say that while both sides may not choose to start an all-out war, their escalatory actions may still trigger one inadvertently. Wimmen of the International Crisis Group said that Israel and Hezbollah are unlikely to take a conscious decision to start a war. However, the more intense the conflict becomes, the deeper each side strikes into the other\u2019s territory and the heavier the weapons used, the more likely it is that \u201csomething goes wrong,\u201d he said. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the opposition and members of his coalition to take action in the north, especially given that so many Israelis have been displaced from the area. More than 53,000 Israelis have been forced to leave their homes in the north, the IDF said. More houses were evacuated this week in the Galilee region in northern Israel after a fire broke following rocket attacks from Lebanon, Israeli police said. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from areas and towns near the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released last week by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d said Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir in a statement. Opposition leader Yair Lapid also slammed the government, saying: \u201cThe north goes up in flames and Israeli deterrence burns with it. \u201cThe government has no plan for the day after in Gaza, no plan to return the residents to the north, no management, no strategy. A government of total abandonment,\u201d Lapid said on X. The US has cautioned against escalation, worried it might spin out of control. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday the United States is \u201cincredibly concerned\u201d about the risk of escalation, adding that the Biden administration is engaged in diplomatic conversations \u201cto try to avoid that conflict from escalating beyond control.\u201d Shaked, the Truman Institute scholar, said that despite Hezbollah\u2019s assertions that its attacks on Israel are in support of Gaza, the group\u2019s strategy is likely to be closely coordinated with its closest ally Iran \u2013 especially with so much at stake. Hezbollah is Iran\u2019s most effective non-state partner. A wider conflict could also draw the Islamic Republic and the United States into the war. Israel and Iran came close to war in April after launching unprecedented direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/middleeast/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-tensions-explainer-update-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_weather_florida-flooding-storm-forecast-thursday", "text": "Heavy rainfall has been inundating South Florida for a third day in a row on Thursday, with flash flood warnings in effect from Miami to Fort Lauderdale, after Wednesday\u2019s storms transformed roads into canals and caused water to seep into homes. Flash flooding is likely to occur at a faster rate than usual as the areas around Miami are already saturated from more than a foot of rain in the past two days. Nearly 1.7 million people living in South Florida \u2013 including the cities of Hialeah, Aventura and Doral \u2013 are under a flash flood warning Thursday evening as a line of storms approach the Miami area and bring the potential to produce several inches of rain in a short period of time, according to the Miami-South Florida office of the\u00a0National Weather Service. \u201cSignificant flash flooding (is) expected over urban areas, (with) locally catastrophic flash flooding possible,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center warned earlier Thursday. High risk days are exceedingly rare \u2014 happening on fewer than 4% of days each year on average \u2014 but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the US. More than 8 million people are under flood alerts Thursday, including Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Naples. Another 4 to 8 inches of widespread rain is expected through Friday, but it\u2019s possible some spots record nearly a foot of rain. Six to more than 20 inches of rain has deluged South Florida since Tuesday morning, prompting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a state of emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties. While the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. Ongoing flooding resulting from past rainfall is one of the main reasons the flood risk is so high Thursday. Floodwaters haven\u2019t had time to fully recede and some communities in and north of the Miami metro remained underwater Thursday morning, aerial imagery showed. That was the case in Hallandale Beach \u2013 located just north of Miami \u2013 where nearly 20 inches of rain had fallen, and some mobile home parks were still underwater, said Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Michael Kane. Severe flooding there on Wednesday covered cars up to their windshields, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety. Others had to be rescued. \u201cWe had to use our boats to rescue people standing on top of the roofs of cars,\u201d Kane told CNN. Kane\u2019s office received 175 calls for help in Hallandale Beach alone. Resident Kait Madrigal spent five hours stuck in her car Wednesday after it became suddenly surrounded by floodwaters on her way to work near Hollywood, Florida, she told CNN. She was able to park on the sidewalk to get to higher ground but began to panic as the water rose and cars began to stall out around her. \u201cIf I was to open my car door, I would\u2019ve just had a ton of water rushing in. I would\u2019ve been out of luck big time,\u201d the 25-year-old said. After hours of unrelenting rain, Madrigal waded through the water and was able to find a possible exit route. Fearing she may become trapped all night, she drove out and was able to get home safely, she said. Several local officials have warned against trying to drive through murky floodwaters and are urging storm-weary South Floridians to stay home. Most flood-related drownings occur when cars unknowingly drive into deep water, the Florida Department of Highway Safety said. Fort Lauderdale, where the mayor declared a local state of emergency, received its entire average June rainfall of around 9.5 inches in just 24 hours Wednesday. Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport led the nation with the most flights canceled or delayed Wednesday, with more than 1,200 disruptions. The air travel woes are expected to continue through the end of the workweek. In Broward County, the severe storms prompted school officials to postpone the demolition of the Marjory\u00a0Stoneman\u00a0Douglas High School building where a gunman killed\u00a017 people in 2018. Many South Florida residents had only just finished repairing their homes after catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps Wednesday. Anna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home. \u201cI put the dogs in, I\u2019m all packed up. I pretty much got everything in bins and we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph told CNN affiliate WSVN Wednesday. \u201cMy husband\u2019s like \u2018Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic,\u2019 but you know, I\u2019m not gonna be caught unprepared.\u201d Significant flood risk Thursday Multiple rounds of torrential downpours fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean are drenching the southern Florida Peninsula on Thursday. Friday will also be another drenching day for South Florida, even as the robust tropical moisture fueling the soaking storms slowly starts to shift out of the area. All told, multiple locations could end up with more than two feet of rain Tuesday through Friday. Wet weather is likely to continue over the weekend, just not to the severity of the past several days. But even the light-to-moderate rainfall rates of typical June showers and thunderstorms could cause additional flooding issues and prevent ongoing flooding from receding. If there\u2019s any silver lining, it\u2019s the rain is beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull\u2019s-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the\u00a0US Drought Monitor. CNN\u2019s Sara Smart and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.
