Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. The results caused such chaos that French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election in his own country, the first round of which the far-right National Rally\u00a0won last week. A government comprised of far-right figures was formed in the Netherlands this week. Italy is led by the most right-wing leader since the rule of fascist wartime leader Benito Mussolini. These electoral victories and the prospect of populist right-wingers in power is no longer a surprise in European countries. There are many reasons for this rise in populism, often unique to individual countries. But broadly speaking, a number of European countries are suffering from sluggish economies, high immigration and higher energy prices, due in part to the drive for carbon net zero. The European Union is often blamed for national woes by populist politicians and breathes oxygen into an increasingly Euroskeptic national discourse. So why is Britain, the only country where Euroskepticism led to a referendum on EU membership, projected to buck this trend? Despite the expected seat count, the British right is far from dead. The Conservative Party, despite its undeniably disappointing night, is set to outperform the expectations of a number of opinion polls during the campaign, some of which had it down to double digits in parliament. Another party that is set to exceed polling expectations is the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by long-term scourge of the Conservatives, Nigel Farage, who is perhaps best known these days for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump. Before this, he was credited with making Brexit possible after decades of campaigning against the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. Farage\u2019s political success to date has all come without him holding a parliamentary seat. Now he is not only projected to have a seat himself, but also 12 colleagues to hurl grenades at Labour leader Keir Starmer. While this may seem small fry compared to Starmer\u2019s anticipated three-figure majority, Farage will no doubt influence the debate on the future direction of the Conservative Party, possibly dragging it further to the right. It is possible that Farage\u2019s splitting of the right has actually helped Starmer increase his majority in parliament. An odd quirk of British politics is that the percentage of votes a party gets doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to seats. And with Reform performing well in many of the seats that Labour will ultimately win, the hard-right will not only be impossible to ignore in this parliament, but it could easily see its influence grow further. Britain suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries. If Starmer falters as prime minister, there is every chance that the popular right could continue to capture the public\u2019s imagination, as it has elsewhere\u00a0in Europe.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/uk-election-europe-populist-surge-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

The snap vote, called by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is being held months earlier than necessary and caught much of his party by surprise. The opposition Labour party suffered its worst defeat since 1935 in the last general election, but has since rebuilt itself under the leadership of Keir Starmer. Thursday\u2019s vote follows a six-week campaign in which all major parties have scoured the country in search of votes. Much of the debate has revolved around the economy, the cost of living, the state of Britain\u2019s public services, and tax and immigration. Largely absent from the debate, however, has been Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union, which it left in 2020 after a referendum four years earlier. Britain has had three Conservative prime ministers since the last general election in 2019, which Boris Johnson won by a landslide. But after much of the country and his party soured on Johnson, Conservative party members voted in 2022 to replace him with Liz Truss, who became the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) then voted to replace her with Sunak. During the campaign, Nigel Farage \u2013 one of the most prominent champions of Brexit \u2013 announced his return to frontline politics to lead the nascent hard-right Reform UK party. Sunak, Starmer, Farage and the heads of all other major parties are expected to make appearances at their own local polling stations throughout the day. Around 46.5 million Brits are eligible to vote in the election. They are casting their ballots in 650 separate constituencies across the nations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with 326 seats required for a party to form a majority government. News outlets are barred from reporting anything that could influence voters while polls are opened.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

Donaldson appeared in front of a preliminary inquiry Wednesday, which decided to push ahead with a trial, scheduled for September 10, according to a statement sent to CNN by the Northern Ireland Courts\u00a0and Tribunals\u00a0Service\u00a0(NICTS). Donaldson stepped down as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in March after he was charged with 11 sexual offenses. The politician has since been charged with a further seven offenses. The 18 alleged offenses include: one charge of rape, 13 charges of indecent assault of a female child and four charges of gross indecency towards a child. Donaldson was asked in court if he wanted to comment on the charges, according to PA Media. \u201cNot at this stage,\u201d he replied, the news agency reported.

North Korea launched two ballistic missiles on Monday morning, according to reports from the South Korean, American and Japanese governments. The missiles, launched at 5:05 a.m. and 5:15 a.m. local time, had two different flight distances, 600 kilometers (373 miles) for the first and 120 kilometers (75 miles) for the second, according to a statement from South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). When asked about the disparate distances, Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for the JCS, in a briefing said, \u201cThere is the possibility that the second launched missile had an abnormal flight in the early stage.\u201d \u201cIf it had exploded during an abnormal flight, there is the possibility that debris fell inland,\u201d Lee said, clarifying that an \u201cexplosion\u201d is one of many possibilities. The military is \u201ccomprehensively analyzing\u201d various possibilities. He added that no damage has been confirmed so far. South Korea said the first missile, with the 600-kilometer (373-mile) flight distance, was a short-range ballistic missile, but Lee would only say the second was \u201ca ballistic missile,\u201d which leaves open the possibility of it being a new weapon. According to JCS, the two missiles were launched northeastward from the Changyon-gun area of South Hwanghae province, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) southwest of Pyongyang. If the missile exploded after flying 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeastward from Changyon-gun, the debris could have landed near Pyongyang, based on the distance traveled from the launch site. The JCS could not confirm whether there was an explosion near the capital, which is North Korea\u2019s largest city and home to more than 3 million people. Last week, North Korea said it successfully conducted a\u00a0test to deploy multiple warheads from a single-stage engine for a medium- to long-range ballistic missile, marking an important milestone in upgrading its missile technology. South Korea later said the North Korean claim was false. Lee, the JCS spokesperson, said that during a successful test, multiple warheads should separate from a missile during the descending stage of its flight, but North Korea\u2019s missile had exploded in the early stage during launch. North Korea did not make any statements after Monday morning\u2019s launches, but on Sunday put out a statement on the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) denouncing the recent US-South Korea-Japan military exercises named \u201cFreedom Edge,\u201d calling it another sign of the three partners \u201creckless and provocative military muscle-flexing.\u201d The statement said North Korea would \u201ccontinue to make important efforts to deter the acts of disturbing peace and stability\u201d on the Korean Peninsula. Technically the two Koreas\u00a0remain at war\u00a0\u2013 an armistice ended the Korean War that split the peninsula in 1953 but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Relations between the two countries thawed somewhat in 2017 and 2018, but the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years as leader Kim ramped up weapons testing in defiance of United Nations sanctions and diplomatic talks fell apart. Meanwhile, both nations are drawing closer to their respective partners \u2013 with North Korea recently signing a defense agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0and South Korea stepping up cooperation with Japan and the United States. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Monday\u2019s missile tests, which occurred during ongoing meetings of the Central Committee of the ruling Worker\u2019s Party, likely served two purposes for the Kim regime. \u201cIn both North Korean politics and military policy, the best defense is often a good offense. These missile launches are likely the Kim regime\u2019s way of compensating for recent failed tests, aiming to impress a domestic audience during ruling party meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cPyongyang is also determined not to appear weak while South Korea conducts defense exercises with Japan and the United States.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/asia/north-korea-failed-missile-test-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

A 15th-century Irish castle outside Dublin decorated in the theme of Robin Hood. A verdant tiered wedding cake piled high with fondant leaves and apples \u2014 designed by British artist Damien Hirst \u2014 cut ceremoniously with a saber. Two baroque thrones for the bride and groom. But perhaps the most memorable detail of all: The newlyweds dressed in matching purple Antonio Berardi outfits for their reception. This was, of course, the holy union of Victoria and David Beckham. The British power couple got hitched in 1999, fusing the worlds of fashion and football forever.

Specifically, their eggplant-hued ensembles. \u201cI even had a top hat in purple,\u201d David said in 2017 during an interview with BBC Radio 4. \u201cWhat was I thinking?

The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada.

The Eugenic Protection Law, in place from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to forcibly sterilize people with disabilities, including those with mental disorders, hereditary diseases or physical deformities, and leprosy. It also allowed forced abortions if either parent had those conditions. The law had aimed to \u201cprevent the increase of the inferior descendants from the eugenic point of view and to protect the life and health of the mother as well,\u201d according to a copy of the law \u2013 which listed \u201cremarkable abnormal sexual desire\u201d and \u201cremarkable clinical inclination\u201d among the conditions targeted. About 25,000 people were sterilized without consent during that period, according to the court ruling, citing ministry data. Though the government had offered to compensate each victim 3.2 million yen (about $19,800) in 2019 under a relief law, victims and their supporters argued that was far from enough \u2013 with a number continuing their fight in court. Wednesday\u2019s ruling addressed five such lawsuits, filed by plaintiffs from across the country to lower courts which then advanced to the Supreme Court. In four of those cases, the lower courts had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs \u2013 which the Supreme Court upheld on Wednesday, ordering the government to pay 16.5 million yen (about $102,000) to the plaintiffs and 2.2 million yen ($13,000) to their spouses. In the fifth case, the lower court had ruled against the plaintiffs and dismissed their case, citing the 20-year statute of limitations. The Supreme Court overturned this decision on Wednesday, calling the statute \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cextremely contrary to the principles of justice and fairness.\u201d The case is now sent back to the lower court to determine how much the government should pay. \u201cThe legislative intent of the former Eugenic Protection Law cannot be justified in light of the social conditions of the time,\u201d said Judge Saburo Tokura when handing down the judgment, according to public broadcaster NHK. \u201cThe law imposes a grave sacrifice in the form of the loss of reproductive capacity, which is extremely contrary to the spirit of respect for individual dignity and personality, and violates Article 13 of the Constitution,\u201d he added \u2013\u00a0referring to every person\u2019s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. After Wednesday\u2019s decision, plaintiffs outside the court\u00a0\u2013\u00a0elderly men and women, many in wheelchairs \u2013 celebrated with their lawyers and supporters, holding up banners that read \u201cvictory.\u201d They are among 39 total plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits in recent years \u2013 with six having died since, according to NHK, highlighting the urgency of these cases as victims reach their final years. In a press conference after the court ruling, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi expressed the government\u2019s remorse and apology to victims, NHK reported. The government will promptly pay the compensation, and consider other measures such as a meeting between the plaintiffs and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/asia/japan-supreme-court-sterilization-eugenics-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_middleeast_al-shifa-hospital-director-released-israel-detention-intl-hnk", "text": "The head of Gaza\u2019s largest hospital has claimed he was repeatedly tortured\u00a0during his seven months in Israeli detention, following his sudden release Monday, in a move that highlighted growing rifts in the Israeli establishment. Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of the Al-Shifa medical complex, who was arrested in late November during the first of two Israeli raids on the facility in Gaza City, was released along with 50 other Palestinian detainees. Their release has sparked outcry in Israel and was criticized across the political spectrum, as well as by families of the Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas during its deadly October 7 attack. At a news conference Monday, Abu Salmiya alleged Palestinian detainees suffered \u201csevere torture\u201d and had medical treatment denied. \u201cMy little finger was broken. I was repeatedly subjected to hitting on the head, causing bleeding multiple times. There was almost daily torture in the Israeli prisons,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe doctor there beats the detainees, and the nurse beats the detainees. This is in violation of all international laws.\u201d Abu Salmiya said fellow prisoners lost a significant\u00a0amount of weight and were \u201ccompletely denied treatment.\u201d \u201cThey amputated the feet of several prisoners, those who are suffering from diabetes symptoms due to the lack of medical treatment for them,\u201d he said. In response to allegations of abuse, the Israeli Prison Service told CNN Monday it was \u201cnot aware of the claims,\u201d that \u201call prisoners are detained according to the law\u201d and \u201call basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards.\u201d A prison service spokesperson said, \u201cprisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities.\u201d Abu Salmiya was reportedly detained while evacuating the hospital with a World Health Organization convoy. The Israeli military said at the time the director was \u201capprehended and transferred for \u2026 questioning following evidence showing that the Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control center.\u201d Al-Shifa became a flashpoint in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza and now lies in ruins following a 14-day Israeli siege in March. Israel repeatedly claimed that a Hamas command center sat underneath the medical complex and that the militant group has used it\u00a0to hold hostages. Hamas has denied the claims, as have health officials working there. CNN cannot independently verify the accusations and Israel has not released definitive proof to back the claim. Other Palestinian detainees released on Monday described overcrowded detention centers where prisoners were abused, diseases were rife, and food was scarce. \u201cMorning and night we were being beaten, besides the solitary confinement and besides the diseases that spread between the prisoners,\u201d released detainee Faraj Attiyeh Al-Saman told CNN. \u201cThey would show us photos of our relatives\u2019 bodies, pictures of our families and children \u2026 and say: \u2018Look at your children, we killed them.\u2019 They would show us pictures of our wives, our sisters, and tell us that they had taken them and done this and that to them,\u201d Faraj said. It is unclear how the released detainees were arrested and under what premise. Those CNN spoke to were detained after being questioned at Gaza checkpoints. Israeli security officials have previously told CNN that they have been made aware of allegations of torture tactics being used against Palestinians within Israel\u2019s prison system and have said they are investigating. Israeli outcry The release has created tensions within Israel as its war with Hamas stretches into its ninth month, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordering an \u201cimmediate inquiry into the matter,\u201d according to his office. Netanyahu said the decision followed discussions at the High Court, and the identity of the released prisoners was determined independently by security officials \u201cbased on their professional considerations.\u201d Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet said in a statement that detainees who posed a \u201clesser danger\u201d were released to \u201cfree up places of confinement.\u201d Shin Bet said it had been warning for about a year of the need to increase the number of spaces in detention centers \u201cgiven the need to arrest terrorists\u201d in the West Bank and Gaza. \u201cWithout a choice, without an immediate solution to the prison shortage, arrests will continue to be canceled and detainees will continue to be released,\u201d the agency said. But far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was among those outraged by the decision, calling the release of Abu Salmiya and other prisoners \u201csecurity negligence.\u201d Former defense minister Benny Gantz, who resigned from Israel\u2019s\u00a0War Cabinet last month, said \u201cwhoever made this decision lacked judgment and should be fired today.\u201d The decision to release the detainees comes as families of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas during the October 7 attacks continue to wait for news of their loved ones. As many as 120 hostages remain captive in Gaza. In a statement Monday, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum headquarters said it hoped the Israeli government would be \u201cdetermined to release our family members, with the same determination as it releases the director of Shifa Hospital.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/middleeast/al-shifa-hospital-director-released-israel-detention-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-talks-hamas-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations to try and broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, an Israeli official and a source familiar with the negotiations said. The decision signals that Israel and Hamas are entering a new phase of negotiations that could produce a final deal within a matter of weeks, if successful. Israel and Hamas on Thursday both appeared inclined to underplay the latest developments in written statements, with people involved in the talks expressing cautious optimism. For months, Israel and Hamas have engaged in mediated negotiations focused on trying to reach a framework agreement, intentionally leaving key details \u2014 such as the identity of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for hostages \u2014 \u00a0aside as they worked to hammer out a framework. The breakthrough in the talks came earlier this week after the United States proposed new language for two key clauses (8 and 14) focused on the scope and sequencing of negotiations set to take place during the first phase of the agreement in order to unlock the second phase of the deal. Hamas broadly agreed with the new language, unlocking detailed negotiations following Netanyahu\u2019s approval. Mossad Director David Barnea, who has led Israel\u2019s negotiating team, is set to lead the negotiating delegation for the new round of detailed talks, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said. Talks are expected to be held in Doha, Qatar, starting as early as Friday, according to a senior Biden administration official. The Mossad director is expected to meet with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani for discussions aiming to bring the parties closer to a deal in Gaza, according to a source with knowledge of the talks. Those negotiations are expected to last two to three weeks, the Israeli source said, to resolve issues such as the identities of Palestinian prisoners to be released, the exact ratio of prisoners to hostages and the technical sequencing of the releases. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau,\u00a0told CNN,\u00a0\u201cthere is nothing official about an effective agreement for ceasefire. The enemy\u2019s media are talking about sending a delegation to Egypt,\u00a0but there is nothing official or any details. Negotiations did not start yet.\u201d \u201cWe are also waiting for a positive response from the Israeli side, which will initiate negotiations into details of the deal,\u201d Naim added. \u201cWe have no information about any delegation visiting Cairo.\u201d Netanyahu spoke Thursday with US President Joe Biden to discuss the progress in the negotiations and the Israeli Cabinet was set to meet Thursday evening. The call focused on the details of the hostage and ceasefire deal, the senior Biden administration official said, adding that there seems to be a \u201cpretty significant opening\u201d for the hostage deal to be agreed upon by all the involved groups. When asked if the administration believes that Netanyahu is playing politics and could try to sabotage the deal, the official said that the deal is structured in a way that \u201cfully protects Israel\u2019s interests.\u201d The official added that Biden will have the opportunity to talk about the deal with other world leaders next week during the NATO summit, which will be held in Washington, DC.

{"id": "2024_07_02_china_china-russia-belarus-full-member-sco-summit-intl-hnk", "text": "A club of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia to\u00a0advance their leaders\u2019 vision of an alternative world order is set to expand again this week \u2013 this time adding a staunch Russian ally that has openly supported Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. The expected admission of Belarus to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) at its annual leaders\u2019 summit in Astana, Kazakhstan is another push by Beijing and Moscow to transform the grouping \u2013 from a regional security bloc into a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies. Belarus, which helped Russia to launch its 2022 invasion of Ukraine,\u00a0will become the latest authoritarian state to join the club, after Iran became a full member last year. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have arrived in Astana for the summit that begins Wednesday, in what will be their second meeting this year. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy,\u00a0is skipping the event, pointing to unease among some members about the direction the SCO is headed. Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years in line with Beijing and Moscow\u2019s shared ambition to counter what they see as US \u201chegemony\u201d and reshape the international system in their favor. In 2017, the bloc underwent its first expansion to welcome India and Pakistan. After adding Belarus, it will boast 10 members, representing more than 40% of the world\u2019s population and roughly a quarter of the global economy. It also has two observer states, Afghanistan and Mongolia, and more than a dozen \u201cdialogue partners\u201d from Myanmar to Turkey and the Arab states. The SCO\u2019s expansion comes after another bloc led by China and Russia, the BRICS group of major emerging economies, more than doubled its membership and significantly extended its global reach last year. Growing ambitions As the SCO grows in international visibility and economic weight, it has also broadened in geopolitical ambitions. The expected admission of Belarus, which borders the European Union,\u00a0\u201creally highlights how the SCO\u2019s mission has changed in the last few years,\u201d said Eva Seiwert, an expert on China\u2019s foreign policy at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) in Berlin. \u201cUnlike Iran, you\u00a0don\u2019t really get much like economic or security cooperation out of Belarus joining. And that\u2019s why I argue that it\u2019s more of a geopolitical move.\u201d With Russia deep in the third year of its grinding war against Ukraine, the SCO has become a crucial diplomatic avenue for Putin, as well as a platform to showcase he\u2019s not isolated internationally. And as\u00a0China\u2019s relations\u00a0with the US have plummeted, Beijing is now less concerned about the SCO being branded an anti-Western organization \u2013 a perception that has only deepened following Iran\u2019s admission, Seiwert said. \u201cThey want the SCO to be perceived as a major bloc that cannot be ignored anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWith all these countries joining, China and Russia (want to show they) both have a lot of supporters for their worldviews.\u201d And in that shared worldview, there is no place for the US in Eurasia. In a meeting with his senior foreign ministry officials last month, Putin laid out a future vision for \u201ca\u00a0new system of\u00a0bilateral and\u00a0multilateral guarantees of\u00a0collective security in\u00a0Eurasia,\u201d with the help of existing organizations like the SCO and a long-term goal to \u201cgradually phase out the\u00a0military presence of\u00a0external powers in\u00a0the\u00a0Eurasian region.\u201d \u201cDuring my\u00a0recent visit to\u00a0China, President Xi Jinping and\u00a0I\u00a0discussed this issue. It was noted that the\u00a0Russian proposal is not contradictory, but rather complements and\u00a0aligns with the\u00a0basic principles of\u00a0the\u00a0Chinese global security initiative,\u201d said Putin, who visited Beijing in May. Frictions and unease That big picture vison of an alternative future is going to be the \u201cheadline message\u201d for China and Russia coming out of this SCO summit, said Bates Gill, a senior fellow for the National Bureau of Asian Research. But the Belarus membership also creates big question marks that will hang over the organization, Gill said. \u201cIt creates all sorts of problems and new questions about the reputation, legitimacy and mandate of the organization, given the nature of the Belarus regime and its support for Russia\u2019s flagrant violation of international law and invasion of Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly the SCO can tolerate authoritarian regimes, but for the mandate of the organization, it further diversifies and dilutes its original focus, which was to be on Central Asia.\u201d The bloc\u2019s expansion hasn\u2019t come without frictions \u2013 notably with the admission of bitter rivals India and Pakistan \u2013 while tensions between Beijing and New Delhi have also flared in recent years following deadly clashes on their disputed Himalayan border. The grouping\u2019s increasingly anti-Western orientation following its embrace of Iran and now Belarus has also fueled unease among members that want to keep good relations with the West, including the former Soviet states in Central Asia. \u201cIn some respects, it puts the Central Asian states in a very awkward position,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThey are pursuing what they like to call multi-trajectory diplomacy. They don\u2019t want to be committed to only dealing with one major power, like Russia or China.\u201d Gill, who visited Central Asia in April and May, said there was an ambivalence in regional capitals about the future of the SCO. Modi is skipping India, too, appeared to be losing interest. Last year, it hosted the summit virtually \u2013 a muted arrangement that allowed Modi to avoid the optics of welcoming Putin and Xi to New Delhi as it sought closer ties with the US. This year, fresh from his third consecutive term inauguration, the Indian leader\u00a0is skipping the summit in Astana \u2013 despite Russian state media reports that he will visit the Kremlin next week. \u201cThis tells us that he does not see the SCO as the most effective channel through which to pursue Indian interests in this part of the world,\u201d Gill said. Even China, the main driver behind the SCO\u2019s expansion, is seeking a more direct way to engage with Central Asia \u2013 without Russia\u2019s involvement. Last year, five leaders from the region received a lavish welcome at the inaugural China-Central Asia summit in the Chinese city of Xi\u2019an, the starting point of the ancient Silk Road trade route that linked imperial China with civilizations to its west over a millennium ago.\u00a0In March, a permanent Secretariat for the China-Central Asia mechanism was established in the same city. And while China and Russia aspire to present the SCO as a counterweight to US-led institutions, it remains a much weaker and less cohesive bloc compared with the likes of NATO, the European Union or the Group of Seven nations. \u201cGiven the expansion of membership with India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus, the organization will be even less like an alliance or committed common grouping, and more like a strategic-vision type of organization \u2026 representative of a Eurasian identity,\u201d Gill said. After the summit in Astana, China is due to take up the rotating presidency of the SCO for a year. Seiwert, the expert at MERICS, said Beijing would work to find more common ground among member states. \u201cFor China, it\u2019s important that the SCO doesn\u2019t fail, that it is perceived as successful. I think they\u2019re also aware of all the difficulties that have come with all these different expansions,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it keeps on expanding \u2013 if Russia and China keep on pushing it to expand \u2013 then I think its regional relevance will really just diminish.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/china/china-russia-belarus-full-member-sco-summit-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_07_02_weather_hurricane-beryl-jamaica-caribbean-forecast", "text": "Hurricane Beryl, now a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm, has set its sights on Jamaica after leaving at least one person dead and inflicting ruin across entire islands in the Caribbean on Monday. The storm is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica on Wednesday and impact the Cayman Islands on Thursday, where a hurricane watch has been issued. The storm continues to smash records as it kicks off an exceptionally early hurricane season as the earliest Category 5 hurricane \u2013 and only the second Atlantic storm of such strength to be recorded in July. Beryl alarming strengthening has been fed by\u00a0abnormally warm ocean waters driven by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. It took only\u00a0minutes for Beryl to tear through Grenada on Monday, blasting through buildings and knocking out power and phone service to almost all of the island\u2019s residents, the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cIn half an hour, Carriacou was flattened,\u201d Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Monday. A path of \u201cimmense destruction, pain (and) suffering\u201d was torn through the neighboring nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where at least one person has been reported dead, said Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves. Parts of the islands, including hospitals, have no electricity and others are without water. About 90% of the homes on the nation\u2019s Union Island are damaged or destroyed, Gonsalves said. Hundreds more homes and several schools, churches and government buildings in St. Vincent also sustained severe damage. \u201cTomorrow we get up with our commitment and conviction to rebuild our lives and our families\u2019 lives,\u201d Gonsalves said Monday night. Though Beryl is likely to fluctuate in strength in the coming days, it is expected to remain an \u201cextremely dangerous major hurricane\u201d \u2013 Category 3 or stronger \u2013 through mid-week, the hurricane center said. The hurricane will continue packing strong winds, torrential rain and hazardous seas extending well beyond its center over much of the Caribbean. Even if Beryl doesn\u2019t make landfall in Jamaica, its outer bands will bring significant impacts. The latest on Beryl \u2022 Jamaica braces for severe impacts: A hurricane warning is in place for Jamaica, where hurricane conditions will impact the island on Wednesday. Tropical storm-force winds are expected earlier in the day on Wednesday. Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels and rainfall of 4 to 8 inches with isolated totals up to 12 inches is forecast. \u2022 Dominican Republic and Haiti under storm warnings: The southern coasts of Haiti and Dominican Republic remain under tropical storm warnings, with tropical storm conditions beginning Tuesday. Storm surge up to 3 feet is possible, and rainfall totals could reach 6 inches. \u2022 Extended state of emergency in Grenada: The order has been extended until July 7 due to the severe damage wrought by the storm, said Neila K. Ettienne, spokesperson for the prime minister\u2019s office. About 95% of the island of Grenada has lost power, she said. Telecommunications are also down and some individuals have lost internet service. \u2022 St. Vincent and Grenadines rush to restore power: Local authorities are \u201cworking feverishly, urgently and with great focus to get electricity in certain places tonight,\u201d Prime Minister Gonsalves said Monday. Many trees have collapsed on power lines. Even so, government buildings will reopen Tuesday and the prime minister urged business owners to open, if possible. \u2022 Huge blow to Barbados fishing industry: Though Barbados was spared from the brunt of the storm, large storm surge damaged numerous fishing vessels \u2013 a massive loss to the nation\u2019s fishing industry. At least 20 vessels have sunken, Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley said Monday. Some fishermen at the Bridgetown Fisheries Complex watched helplessly as violent waves slammed boats into each other or pulled them underwater, CNN affiliate CBC reports. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do than stand and watch total destruction \u2013 our livelihood gone down the drain,\u201d one resident told CBC. \u2022 Cricket team and fans stranded: Some cricket fans who had traveled to Barbados for the T20 World Cup \u2013 and even the winning Indian team itself \u2013 have been unable to leave the island as Hurricane Beryl forced the Grantley Adams International Airport to suspend operations. But the Indian team is likely to make its way home Tuesday after the airport\u2019s planned reopening, Mottley said.  Kicking off a far from normal hurricane season Beryl has shattered numerous records and is a troubling indicator that this season will be far from normal in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. On Sunday it became the earliest\u00a0major hurricane \u2013 defined as one that is Category 3 or higher \u2013 in the Atlantic in 58 years and the only one to reach Category 4 status in the month of June. It is also the strongest known hurricane to pass through the southern Windward Islands, which lie at the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea, according to data from NOAA that goes back to 1851. The hurricane was able to churn to life because the ocean is as warm now as it would normally be at the peak of hurricane season, said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and science advisor at nonprofit First Street Foundation. \u201cHurricanes don\u2019t know what month it is, they only know what their ambient environment is,\u201d Kossin told CNN. \u201cBeryl is breaking records for the month of June because Beryl thinks it\u2019s September.\u201d The ocean warm ocean temperatures fueling Beryl\u2019s unprecedented strengthening \u201ccertainly have a human fingerprint on them,\u201d Kossin said.

The Israeli military\u2019s Civil Administration department, which manages civilian matters in the West Bank, issued the declaration\u00a0on June\u00a025\u00a0converting the area into state land, according to a\u00a0document\u00a0from the body, but the official notice wasn\u2019t\u00a0posted\u00a0until Wednesday, Peace Now said. The declaration covers a 1,270 hectare (3,138 acre) section of the Jordan Valley in the eastern West Bank near Jericho, the document from the Civil Administration shows. Peace Now, an Israeli rights group\u00a0that\u00a0monitors illegal Israeli settlement expansion, criticized the move in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Wednesday, saying that the\u00a0seizure\u00a0makes it\u00a0even more\u00a0difficult to establish \u201ca Palestinian state alongside Israel.\u201d The group also noted that the latest declaration followed several previous announcements\u00a0that\u00a0have made this year the biggest, by far, for Israeli land seizures in the Palestinian territory,\u00a0according to data it has collected that dates back to 1993. According to the report, declaring land as state property is one of Israel\u2019s primary methods for asserting control over the occupied territories. Once land is designated as state land, Israel no longer recognizes it as privately owned by Palestinians. CNN has reached out to the spokesperson for Israel\u2019s Civil Administration for comment about this specific claim by Peace Now, but has yet to hear back. \u2018Thwarting\u2019 Palestinian statehood Separately,\u00a0on Monday Israel\u2019s Higher Planning Council, the government body responsible for greenlighting new housing construction in parts of the West Bank, said it would move to approve thousands of new housing units in dozens of Israeli settlements,\u00a0according\u00a0to Peace Now. Israel\u2019s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the Defense Ministry with significant control over civilian matters in the occupied West Bank, celebrated the move in a Wednesday\u00a0post\u00a0on X. \u201cBuilding the good country and thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state. MTA is meeting this morning to approve over 5,000 housing units,\u201d he wrote, using an acronym for The Higher Planning Council.

As a teenager, Ram Bahadur Bamjon had drawn international attention when in 2005 tens of thousands of people turned up to see the \u201cBuddha Boy\u201d sitting cross-legged under a tree in a dense forest in southeastern Nepal for nearly 10 months.

{"id": "2024_07_02_europe_french-election-drop-outs-intl-latam", "text": "As French citizens get set to vote in runoff parliamentary elections on Sunday hundreds of contenders have bowed out in an effort to block the far-right party from the gates of power. Over 200 candidates from President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist camp and the left-wing alliance have stepped down in a bid to avoid splitting the vote. They\u2019ve put aside their differences with one goal in mind: to keep the far right firmly away from the 289 seats required for an absolute majority currently within their reach. Last Sunday the French people placed the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) and its allies in first place while Macron\u2019s centrist camp came third, behind the left-wing bloc. After the first round in constituencies where no candidate won outright, an unprecedented number of seats \u2013 over 300 - went to a three-way run-off favoring the RN. By Tuesday, as the deadline to drop out closed, fewer than 100 remain, after centrist and left-wing candidates strategically dropped out in individual seats. This tactic could stop some RN candidates from winning, according to analyst Antoine Bristielle. \u201cThe main probability was an absolute majority for the National Rally, but now with all of the withdrawals, I think that\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Bristielle said. In an attempt to deny the RN a majority, the NFP \u2013 a left-wing coalition that wants to lower the retirement age and tax the rich \u2013 promised to withdraw all of its candidates who came in third place in the first round. Leslie Mortreux, an NFP qualifier and the only publicly out transgender runner, stepped aside to give right-wing Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin a better chance of defeating the RN rival in a constituency in the north. Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies also called on their supporters to prevent the far right taking office, but some warned against lending their votes to the hard-left France Unbowed, a party inside the NFP. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire drew the ire of the left on Tuesday when he said no vote should go to the far right but added that he personally would not vote for the far left either. In one constituency in the south, a government minister initially refused to help an NFP candidate, reasoning that she didn\u2019t want her voters to have to choose between two extremes. The following day she tweeted that she was bowing out following pressure from the president and prime minister. In over 80 three-way races, Macron\u2019s centrist candidates dropped out in favor of candidates from the left-wing NFP. But many stopped short of encouraging their supporters to vote for a left-wing opponent. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the difficult decision to withdraw \u2026 leaving it up to my voters to position themselves against the far right or far left,\u201d Samuel Deguara, a candidate from Macron\u2019s camp said after withdrawing. Meanwhile, far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen condemned the political bargaining. \u201cThe act of withdrawing and giving voting instructions shows the worst contempt for voters,\u201d Le Pen said Tuesday. Even before the candidate withdrawals, projections had suggested that after the second round of voting next Sunday, the RN was likely to fall short of an absolute majority and win between 230 and 280 seats in the 577-seat lower house. In speeches before the first round, National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said he would refuse to govern a minority government, in which the RN would require the votes of allies to pass laws. If the RN falls short of an absolute majority and Bardella stays true to his word, Macron might then have to search for a prime minister on the left, or somewhere else entirely. And if the unthinkable for Macron happens and the RN does get an absolute majority, then it will become the first far-right party to enter the French government since World War II.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/europe/french-election-drop-outs-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_us-citizen-russia-drug-charges-sentenced-intl", "text": "A US citizen who was detained in Moscow on drug-related charges in January has been sentenced to 12 years and six months in a maximum-security penal colony, according to a court statement released Thursday. Robert Woodland was found guilty of attempted trafficking of large amounts of illegal drugs as part of an organized group, the Ostankino District Court of Moscow said. Woodland\u2019s lawyers told reporters after the verdict was delivered that they would appeal the ruling as Woodland\u2019s guilt had not been proven, the Associated Press (AP) reported. Woodland has been suffering from unspecified mental health issues, his lawyer Stanislav Kshevitsky told AP without providing any details. He added that the court didn\u2019t take those issues into account. CNN is reaching out to his lawyers for comment. Moscow\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office\u00a0said that on January 3, Woodland was caught trying to hide a \u201clarge batch\u201d of mephedrone after he had transported the synthetic stimulant to an apartment in Moscow. Prosecutors said he had used the apartment to bag the drugs in 49 smaller packages for further illegal sale. Woodland is a US citizen of Russian origin who was adopted by US scientists and he returned to Russia 27 years later. He was born on December 7, 1991, and his real name is Roman Romanov. He comes from the Perm Krai region, far from Moscow and just West of the Ural mountains. The pro-Kremlin tabloid Komosomolskaya Pravda reported in 2020 that Woodland was two years old when he was brought to the US. Woodland is one of at least a dozen US citizens and dual nationals currently being detained in Russia, including Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in\u00a0Russia\u00a0since the Cold War. Gershkovich\u2019s espionage trial began in late June, nearly 15 months after he was first detained. Western officials and analysts have accused Russia of using jailed Americans as political pawns. Discussing the case of\u00a0Ksenia Karelina,\u00a0a US-Russian dual citizen also on trial in Yekaterinburg after being accused of donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity, Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov told CNN that Russia aims \u201cto build up a bank of hostages with American passports,\u201d which Moscow can use \u201cas leverage\u201d in any negotiations with Washington.

{"id": "2024_07_04_sport_china-doping-swimming-olympics", "text": "Swimming\u2019s international governing body says\u00a0its executive director Brent Nowicki has been ordered to testify in a US criminal investigation into a case involving 23 Chinese swimmers who failed doping tests in 2021 but were allowed to continue competing and won medals in the Tokyo Olympics, the Associated Press reports. World Aquatics says Nowicki was served with a subpoena and is \u201cworking to schedule a meeting with the government, which, in all likelihood will obviate the need for testimony before a Grand Jury.\u201d The Chinese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned performance-enhancing substance, several months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics,\u00a0according to a report\u00a0from The New York Times released in April in coordination with German public broadcaster ARD. Eleven of the 23 Chinese swimmers are set to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics. China\u2019s anti-doping agency has said the 23 athletes tested positive for an \u201cextremely low concentration\u201d of trimetazidine at a national swimming competition in 2021. Trimetazidine has the potential to boost endurance and has been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2014. But the agency decided the swimmers were not responsible for the results because they were inadvertently exposed to the drug. In May, the US House select committee on China asked the FBI and the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the case under a 2020 law that allows for the criminal prosecution of people who help athletes dope at international competitions, even if they didn\u2019t happen in the United States. \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on the reported federal law enforcement investigation,\u201d Travis Tygart, the CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency, said in a statement to CNN Thursday. \u201cThe Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act was enacted in 2021 with broad athlete, sport, and multinational governmental support because WADA could not be trusted to be a strong, fair global watchdog to protect clean athletes and fair sport,\u201d Tygart said. In his statement, Tygart, who has blamed WADA and China\u2019s doping watchdog (CHINADA) for covering up the positive tests, implied that WADA officials were afraid to travel to the US out of concern they would face questions from law enforcement. In a news conference earlier this year, WADA President Witold Ba\u0144ka said the agency \u201cfollowed all due processes and diligently investigated every lead and line of enquiry in this matter\u201d and found \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing \u2026 and no credible way to disprove the contamination theory that was accepted by CHINADA.\u201d WADA was notified of the positive tests in June 2021, roughly a month before the Tokyo Games kicked off. CNN has reached out to World Aquatics, the Department of Justice and WADA for comment on the news about the investigation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/china-doping-swimming-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_middleeast_israel-hamas-ceasefire-hostage-talks-intl-latam", "text": "Israel and Hamas appear to be on the brink of a framework agreement for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, an Israeli source familiar with the negotiations said. Israeli officials believe Hamas\u2019 latest response will enable the two parties to enter detailed negotiations to reach an agreement, the source said. A deal, however, is still not finalized nor is it assured. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must first green-light entering into that next phase of negotiations; and it will likely take several weeks of difficult negotiations to negotiate the details of a potential agreement, including the identities of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for Israeli hostages held by Hamas and the sequencing of releases. Israeli negotiators are set to meet with Israel\u2019s political leadership, including Netanyahu, over the coming days to decide whether to enter this phase of detailed negotiations. Hamas has confirmed that it passed a response on an Israeli proposal to mediators Qatar and Egypt, repeating its demand for a complete ceasefire. \u201cWe have put forward some demands that achieve securing access to a complete ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces,\u201d Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, told CNN on Wednesday. Hamas also said in a separate statement on Wednesday that it had \u201cexchanged some ideas\u201d with the mediators aiming to stop \u201cthe aggression against our Palestinian people.\u201d Hamas added in a later statement that it has dealt with the Israeli proposal \u201cpositively.\u201d Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh\u00a0was in touch with the mediators in Qatar and Egypt for hours, discussing with them ideas \u201cin order to\u00a0reach an agreement\u201d to end the war in Gaza, the statement said. \u201cCommunication has also taken place between the head of the movement and officials in Turkey regarding the recent developments,\u201d the statement added. The Mossad, Israel\u2019s intelligence service which has led negotiations, confirmed on Wednesday that Egyptian and Qatari mediators had submitted Hamas\u2019 latest response to Israel. \u201cIsrael is evaluating the remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators,\u201d the Mossad statement said without providing any additional details. The development comes as the Hostage and Missing Families Forum warned in a statement that millions of Israelis would take to the streets if the government fails to secure a deal to release the hostages. \u201cThe people of Israel show time and time again in every poll that they are in favor of a complete deal for the return of all hostages. We will not allow the government\u2019s ministers to torpedo the deal again,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe government is at the highest moral test of its tenure: the continuation of abandonment or a determined action for rescue and restoration,\u201d the statement added. \u201cIt\u2019s either the complete return of the hostages or all Israeli citizens will be taking to the roads and intersections.\u201d Additional reporting by Abeer Salman, Ibrahim Dahman, Tamar Michaelis.

{"id": "2024_06_30_europe_macron-france-election-first-round-intl", "text": "Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party led the first round of France\u2019s parliamentary elections on Sunday, taking it closer to the gates of power than ever before. After an unusually high turnout, the RN bloc clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second with 27.99% and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published by the Interior Ministry on Monday. While the RN appears on track to win the most seats in the National Assembly, it may fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, suggesting France may be heading for a hung parliament and more political uncertainty. Projections show that, after the second round of voting next Sunday, the RN would win between 230 and 280 seats in the 577-seat lower house \u2013 a staggering rise from its count of 88 in the outgoing parliament. The NFP was projected to secure between 125 and 165 seats, with Ensemble trailing with between 70 and 100 seats. A total\u00a0of\u00a076\u00a0candidates\u00a0were\u00a0elected\u00a0to France\u2019s parliament in the first round of the vote, of which 39 represented RN and its allies, 32 were from NFP, and just two from Macron\u2019s alliance, according to the results published on Monday. The election, which Macron called after his party was battered by the RN in European Parliament elections earlier this month, could leave him to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with a prime minister from an opposition party. The RN election party in the northern town of Henin Beaumont erupted in celebration as the results were announced \u2013 but Marine Le Pen was quick to stress that next Sunday\u2019s vote will be key. \u201cDemocracy has spoken, and the French people have placed the National Rally and its allies in first place \u2013 and has practically erased the Macronist bloc,\u201d she told a jubilant crowd, adding: \u201cNothing has been won \u2013 and the second round will be decisive.\u201d In a speech at the RN\u2019s headquarters in Paris, Jordan Bardella, the party\u2019s 28-year-old leader, echoed Le Pen\u2019s message. \u201cThe vote taking place next Sunday is one of the most decisive in the entire history of the Fifth Republic,\u201d Bardella said. In bullish speeches before the first round, Bardella said he would refuse to govern a minority government, in which the RN would require the votes of allies to pass laws. If the RN falls short of an absolute majority and Bardella stays true to his word, Macron might then have to search for a prime minister on the hard left, or somewhere else entirely to form a technocratic government. Following news of the results Sunday night, anti-far right protests broke out in Paris and Lyon, with some 5,500 people gathering in the capital\u2019s Place de la Republique, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Reuters later released a video of demonstrators setting off fireworks as they marched through Paris. While BFMTV reported 200 police were deployed in Lyon to deal with protests. Cordon sanitaire With an unprecedented number of seats going to a three-way run-off, a week of political bargaining will now ensue, as centrist and left-wing parties decide whether or not to stand down in individual seats to block the nationalist and anti-immigrant RN \u2013 long a pariah in French politics \u2013 from winning a majority. When the RN \u2013 under its previous name, the National Front \u2013 has performed strongly in the first round of votes in the past, left-wing and centrist parties have previously united to block them from taking office, under a principle known as the \u201ccordon sanitaire.\u201d After Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2013 the father of Marine and decades-long leader of the National Front \u2013 unexpectedly defeated the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin in the 2002 presidential election, the Socialists swung their weight behind the center-right candidate Jacques Chirac, delivering him a landslide in the second-round runoff. In an attempt to deny the RN a majority, the NFP \u2013 a left-wing coalition that formed earlier this month \u2013 promised it will withdraw all of its candidates who came in third place in the first round. \u201cOur instruction is clear \u2013 not one more vote, not one more seat for the National Rally,\u201d Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of France Unbowed \u2013 the largest party in the NFP \u2013 told supporters Sunday. \u201cA long week awaits us ahead, everyone will take his or her decision with conscience, this decision will determine, in the long-term, the future of our country and each one of our destinies,\u201d Melenchon added. Marine Tondelier, leader of the Green Party \u2013 a more moderate part of the NFP \u2013 made a personal plea to Macron to stand down in certain seats to deny the RN a majority. \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you: withdraw if you come third in a three-way race, and if you don\u2019t qualify for the second round, call your supporters to vote for a candidate who supports republican values,\u201d she said. Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies have also called on their supporters to prevent the far right taking office, but have warned against lending their votes to the firebrand Melenchon. Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege and the outgoing prime minister, urged voters to prevent the RN from winning a majority, but said Melenchon\u2019s France Unbowed party \u201cis preventing a credible alternative\u201d to a far-right government. Former prime minister Eduoard Philippe, another Macron ally, said: \u201cNo votes should be cast for National Rally candidates, but also for France Unbowed candidates, with whom we differ on fundamental principles.\u201d Whether tactical voting can prevent the RN winning a majority is not clear. In Sunday\u2019s vote, the RN won support in places that would have been unthinkable until recently. In the Nord department\u2019s 20th constituency, an industrial heartland, the leader of the Communist Party, Fabien Roussel, was defeated in the first round by an RN candidate with no previous political experience. The seat had been held by the Communists since 1962. A huge gamble Macron\u2019s decision to call a snap election \u2013 France\u2019s first since 1997 \u2013 took the country and even his closest allies by surprise. Sunday\u2019s vote was held three years earlier than necessary and just three weeks after Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was trounced by the RN at the European Parliament elections. Macron has pledged to see out the remainder of his final presidential term, which runs until 2027, but he now faces the prospect of having to appoint a prime minister from an opposition party \u2013 in a rare arrangement known as \u201ccohabitation.\u201d The French government faces little trouble in passing laws when the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party. When they don\u2019t, things can grind to a halt. While the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy, the parliamentary majority is responsible for passing domestic laws, like pensions and taxation. But these remits could overlap, potentially sending France into a constitutional crisis. Bardella, for instance, has ruled out sending troops to help Ukraine resist Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 an idea floated by Macron \u2013 and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. It is unclear whose will would prevail in disputes like this, where the line between domestic and foreign policy is blurred. A far-right government could spell a financial as well as constitutional crisis. The RN has made lavish spending pledges \u2013 from rolling back Macron\u2019s pension reforms to cutting taxes on fuel, gas and electricity \u2013 at a time when France\u2019s budget might be brutally slashed by Brussels. With one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone, France may need to embark on a period of austerity to avoid falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules. But, if implemented, the RN\u2019s spending plans would make France\u2019s deficit soar \u2013 a prospect that has alarmed the bond markets and led to warnings of a \u201cLiz Truss-style financial crisis,\u201d referring to the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. In a terse statement Sunday evening, Macron said the high turnout showed French voters\u2019 \u201cdesire to clarify the political situation\u201d and called for his supporters to rally in the second round. \u201cFaced with the National Rally, the time has come for a broad, clearly democratic and Republican rally for the second round,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_02_middleeast_israeli-military-orders-evacuations-in-southern-gaza-intl", "text": "The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders on Monday for areas in southern Gaza, including eastern Khan Younis and Rafah. This forced residents, many already displaced, to find new shelter, due to the suggestion of the possibility of another ground operation. The Gaza European Hospital in Khan Younis, one of the territory\u2019s last standing hospitals, is within the evacuation zone. It has transferred patients, including those in intensive care and babies in incubators, and medical equipment to other facilities \u201cin fear of bloodshed,\u201d according to the hospital\u2019s deputy director and doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s a chaotic scene and very difficult and dire,\u201d Dr.\u00a0Saleh al Hams, deputy director of Gaza\u00a0European Hospital in Khan Younis, told CNN. This is his third evacuation, he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Tuesday that staff at the hospital have performed more than 3,000 surgeries, treated hundreds of burn cases and provided physical rehabilitation to wounded people. \u201cAn ICRC team stayed in the hospital overnight, however the hospital is now unable to continue functioning effectively because so many staff members have evacuated, including medical, nursing, administration and support staff.\u201d The ICRC said they would now move their team and patients to the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah-Mawasi and, once conditions allow, staff will return to EGH and continue to work there. It said thousands of Palestinians have been displaced following the IDF evacuation orders, stressing there is \u201cno safe place\u201d in Gaza. Another ground operation in Khan Younis would underscore the difficulties faced by the Israeli military in trying to root out Palestinian militants from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew its ground forces from\u00a0the city\u00a0in April after months of fierce fighting that left much of it in ruins. After more than eight months of war, militants continue to hold dozens of Israeli hostages and fire rockets at Israel. Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted on Monday that the country\u2019s military is advancing to the \u201cend of the stage of eliminating\u201d Hamas\u2019 army in Gaza and will \u201ccontinue striking its remnants.\u201d He vowed that Israel would achieve its goals in war: returning the hostages held in Gaza as well as eliminating Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities. On Tuesday, the IDF said that about 20 projectiles were launched from the Khan Younis area toward Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip on Monday, adding that it struck targets in the area from which the projectiles were fired. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad said on Monday that it fired \u201ctargeted rockets\u201d at five Israeli communities close to the Gaza border. On Monday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reported that the emergency room at Al Amal Hospital in Khan Younis was overwhelmed with injuries after patients were transferred from the European Hospital following an Israeli military evacuation order for the Al Fukhari area. PRCS said the hospital also received patients from Nasser Hospital, which had similarly become overcrowded with patients from the European Hospital. In a separate statement, hours after the initial evacuation order, the IDF said the order \u201cdoes not apply to the patients in the European Hospital or the medical staff working there.\u201d \u201cThere is no intention to evacuate the European Hospital,\u201d the IDF statement added. Videos posted to social media showed hospital patients on stretchers being moved through nearby streets following the order. On Tuesday, Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson for the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, who is currently in Gaza, reported a \u201cmassive\u201d movement of people from the evacuation zones following the Israeli military\u2019s latest order. The agency anticipates that around 250,000 people will leave the evacuation zones after the latest order. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes and shelling on Khan Younis continued, with at least eight people killed and 32 injured overnight, according to Nasser hospital. Desalination plant Khan Younis is home to a UN-managed water desalination plant that supplies the city as well as Deir al-Balah and al-Mawasi, where scores of displaced Palestinians are residing. Gaza\u2019s clean water supply decreased significantly after desalination plants were forced to shut down following the siege imposed by the Israeli military in the wake of the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7. On Tuesday, COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for coordination with the Palestinian territories, and the IDF said in a joint statement that Israel would connect a new power line directly to the Khan Younis desalination plant to raise the production of drinking water to 20,000 cubic meters from 5,000. The UN estimated late last year that average water consumption in Gaza dropped to three liters per person per day. The World Health Organization recommends, in emergencies, a minimum of 7.5 liters to 15 liters of water per person per day for survival and hygiene.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/middleeast/israeli-military-orders-evacuations-in-southern-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

Earlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line. It\u2019s due to set sail in February 2025. With stopovers in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, \u201cThe Big Nude Boat\u201d is billed as a \u201conce in a lifetime experience\u201d with amenities designed to \u201cfit everyone\u2019s style of bare cruising.\u201d  And couples will soon be able to tie the knot sans clothes at Is Benas Beach in Sardinia, which has a naturist-designated area. The news was confirmed in May by Luigi Tedeschi, mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town to the beach. \u201cNudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists], it\u2019s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cIt should be respected \u2013 so why not?\u201d Meanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.  From rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it\u2019s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.   \u201cSoft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,\u201d says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who\u2019s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of \u201cThe World\u2019s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.\u201d  While clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it\u2019s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era. During the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the \u201cAdamic air bath\u201d \u2013 his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of \u201cthe free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.\u201d Channeling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.  One of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a \u201cfree beach\u201d movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world.  And their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year. Here are 24 of the best nude beaches you can visit around the world in 2024:  Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Uruguay  Located about a 30-minute drive from Punta del Este, Uruguay\u2019s best-known nude beach overlooks Portezuelo Bay on the Atlantic coast.  Photogenic dunes and water temperatures that reach 25 Celsius (77 F) and higher even in the Southern Hemisphere winter add to the strand\u2019s allure.     After decades as an unofficial naked getaway, Chihuahua finally achieved legal status in 2000.  Since then, amenities have expanded to include the Hotel El Refugio Nudista Naturista clothing-optional resort. Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Avenida Las Amarras, 20003 Chihuahua, Uruguay   Nida Nude Beach, Lithuania The chilly Baltic Sea may not seem like the most obvious place to skinny dip. But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe\u2019s most picturesque spots to take it all off. With its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists\u2019 colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.  Walk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.  Nida Nude Beach, Nidos-Smiltyn\u0117s pl., Nida, Lithuania Agesta Beach, Sweden Sweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.  Based in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach\u2019s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city. Open from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available. Agesta Beach, Huddinge, Sweden Little Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand  Although it\u2019s technically legal to go naked on any beach in personal-liberty-loving New Zealand, the nation\u2019s naturists tend to congregate at well-known clothing-optional spots like Little Palm Beach on Waiheke Island.  Reaching the secluded strand entails a 40-to-60-minute ferry ride from Auckland, a taxi or rideshare to the island\u2019s north shore, and then a short downhill hike.  You can top or tail your beach adventure at Waiheke\u2019s many wineries, restaurants, and art galleries.    Little Palm Beach, Miro Road, Waiheke Island 1081, New Zealand   Nugal Beach, Croatia Flanked by sheer cliffs and shades by pine trees, this remote beach on the mainland opposite Bra\u010d island is reached via a narrow path that seems ready made for goats rather than people seeking an apparel-free escape on the Adriatic.   Be sure to bring a thick towel or even a beach chair \u2014 like many Croatian beaches the surface is pebbles rather than sand.  Nugal is about a half-an-hour walk from the nearest town, although it can also be reached by boat or sea kayak from Makarska or Tu\u010depi. Nugal Beach, 21300 Makarska, Croatia   Moshup Beach, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts Perched at the island\u2019s western extreme, Moshup is a long curving strand that wraps around a headline crowned by the historic Gay Head Lighthouse (built in 1799).  Located right below the ancient light, the clothing optional portion lies beneath rust-colored sandstone cliffs that were declared a National Natural Monument in 1966.  Moshup is open free of charge to anyone who wants to take their clothes off, as opposed to Lucy Vincent, the island\u2019s private nude beach.    Moshup Beach, 71 Moshup Trail, Aquinnah, MA 02535  Black\u2019s Beach, La Jolla, California Set beneath the high cliffs of Torrey Pines, Blacks has been the Golden State\u2019s favorite place for all-over tans for more than 50 years and was once the only legal nude beach in the entire United States.  Long, wide and blessed with great surf, the beach is reached via the zig-zag Ho Chi Minh Trail from La Jolla Farms Road or the Citizens Trail from Torrey Pines Gliderport near the University of California, San Diego. Black\u2019s Beach, Torrey Pines Scenic Drive, San Diego, CA 92037 Lady Bay Beach, Sydney, Australia  Although it sometimes seems like just about any beach in Australia is clothing optional, there are a number of official nude beaches here such as Lady Bay. (also known as Lady Jane Beach.)  Perched just inside the South Head of Sydney Harbour, it\u2019s small and narrow, but incredibly secluded for such a big city location.  The rocky ledges around South Head are also used for nude sunbathing.  Lady Bay Beach, Watson\u2019s Bay, Sydney, Australia Buhne 16, Sylt, Germany \u201cGrin and bare it\u201d might well be the motto for nudists on this North Sea island, where the average water temperature in summer is a chilly 17 C (63 F).  Technically all of the beaches on Sylt are clothing optional, but Buhne 16 was the first and is still the foremost location for nude sunbathing along the German shore.   It\u2019s a place where beachgoers can chill in the famous blue and white striped wicker beach chairs or let it all hang out at summer beach parties.  Buhne 16, Listlandstr 133b, 25980 Kampen (Sylt), German Wreck Beach, Vancouver, Canada Billed as one of the world\u2019s longest nude beaches at 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) long, Wreck Beach is actually a series of sandy strands, pebble flats and rocky outcrops wrapped around the end of Point Grey.  With the University of British Columbia just across the street, a steady stream of students and teachers have shed their clothes on this beach since the early 1970s, when it first became popular.  Evergreen trees along the shore and snowcapped peaks across the water complement the Canadian ambiance.  Wreck Beach, Vancouver, British Columbia; Canada Red Beach, Crete, Greece This secluded shore on the south side of Crete is a hotspot for nude sunbathing in Greece.  Named after its ocher-colored sand and cliffs, Red Beach (or Kokkini Ammos) is reached via a 20-minute hike from Matala or a very short boat ride from the village waterfront. Pioneered by Euro hippies during the 1960s, the beach offers chair and umbrella rentals and is home to a funky little bar called Yianni\u2019s that\u2019s renowned for its mojitos.  Note: the mysterious rock carvings at the end of the beach are a modern creation and definitely not ancient Minoan relics.    Red Beach, Matala, Crete 702 00, Greece  Callantsoog Beach, Netherlands Callantsoog is the oldest nudist beach in the Netherlands, having been officially recognized as a nudist beach since 1973.  Situated 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Amsterdam, near the coastal town of Callantsoog, this beautiful stretch of sand enjoys Blue Flag status and is a great place to spot seals.  Its designated nudist section is marked between two poles. Those keen to get even closer to nature can pay a visit to the nearby Zwanenwater, a protected nature reserve and home to the largest natural dune lakes in Europe. Callantsoog Beach, Strandslag Dorpsplein, 1759 Callantsoog, Netherlands Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barts While the Caribbean may be full of wonderful, chilled out beaches, this wild, white sand strand on the rear side of St. Barts is one of the few places on the islands where public nudity is tolerated (although sunbathing naked is technically prohibited in St. Barts.) Anse de Grande Saline (or Saline Beach) is another self-catering beach. Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.  L\u2019Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit. Just make sure to put your clothes back on before heading over. Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barth\u00e9lemy Platja des Cavallet, Ibiza, Spain Set between the deep blue Mediterranean and multicolored salt pans near Ibiza\u2019s southernmost point, official nudist beach Es Cavallet is separated into various different sections, including a beach club party section, a gay scene and a more secluded, middle section where the clothing-free crowd hang out.  However nude sunbathers aren\u2019t the only beings who frequent this area. Those bright pink things you\u2019ll see pacing in the background aren\u2019t sunburned tourists, but rather flamingos that like to gather in the shallow salines.    Platja des Cavallet, 07818, Balearic Islands, Spain Little Beach, Maui, Hawaii Flanked by ancient lava flows and backed by a volcanic cinder cone, Little Beach would be super-cool even if you didn\u2019t take your clothes off. Like many such beaches, going sans swimsuit is not officially sanctioned here and citations are possible. Part of Makena State Park on the island\u2019s southeast coast, the beach overlooks a national marine sanctuary renowned for its sea turtles, dolphins, whales and tropical fish.  Gnarled trees behind the sand provide a modicum of shade and the cove is well protected for swimming.  Additionally, a drum circle and fire dancers entertain the crowd during Sunday sunsets. Little Beach, Makena State Park, Makena Rd, Kihei, HI 96753, USA Cap d\u2019Agde beach, France Sometimes called the \u201cNaked City,\u201d Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village is the world\u2019s largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season. Visitors are free to be naked wherever they want \u2013 restaurants and stores, post offices or banks, sailing their boat or lounging on the long public beach (where nudity is obligatory, even for those not staying at the resort).  Non residents can stay overnight at the naturist hotel, camp ground or rental units.  Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village, Rond-Point du Bagnas, 34300 Agde, France Is Benas Beach, Sardinia, Italy Situated along Sardinia\u2019s west coast close to the town of San Vero Milis, Is Benas is known for its remoteness and pristine environment. The idyllic beach has had a partially hidden naturist-designated area for the past two years. Mayor Luigi Tedeschi of nearby San Vero Milis recently confirmed that local authorities had given the go ahead for couples to say their vows there au naturel at Is Benas in the future. \u201cWe have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism,\u201d Tedeschi told CNN. \u201cAnd then we thought, let\u2019s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.\u201d The beach is right next to the more famous Is Arenas Beach, while the ruins of Tharros, a Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, can also be found nearby. Is Benas Beach, Province of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Mpenjati Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  South Africa\u2019s only official nude beach \u2013 and perhaps the only legal clothing-not-obligatory strand on the entire African continent \u2013 is located in the Mpenjati Nature Reserve south of Durban.  Its legal status was achieved in 2014, but this came with a list of prohibitions including no staring, no photography, no suggestive behavior, etc.  Local clergy and others continue to mount protests (legal and otherwise) against the naked designation. Mpenjati Nature Reserve, Palm Beach, Port Edward, South Africa Playa Zipolite, Oaxaca, Mexico  Live your \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d fantasies at the beach where so many of the scenes from the sensuous 2001 Mexican movie starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal were shot on location. Pioneered by Mexican and American hippies during the 1960s, the strand stretches about two kilometers with rocky bluffs at either end, and is famed as a clothing-optional beach (although it isn\u2019t legal here.) While the main beach here is backed by budget hotels and cafes, a tiny sliver of sand at the eastern end called Playa del Amor offers far more privacy. Playa Zipolite, San Pedro Pochutla, Oaxaca, Mexico  Metsoke Dragot, Israel Float nude in the warm, ultra-buoyant salty water and smear your entire naked body with soothing, mineral-infused black mud at this rocky beach on the western shore of the Dead Sea.  Perhaps the only place in the Middle East where any kind of public nudity is tolerated, Metsoke Dragot is located about an hour\u2019s drive from Jerusalem and requires a short but rough drive along an unpaved road to reach the shoreline. Primitive camping is aloud along the shore. The only nearby hotel and bar is the cliff top Metzoke Dragot Travelers Village.  Metsoke Dragot, Highway 90, Dead Sea, Israel  Praia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil   The string bikinis on Copacabana may expose an awful lot of Brazilian flesh, but not nearly as much as this naturist beach along the Bahia coast.  A two-hour drive north of Salvador, the nude beach is about a one-kilometer walk from the parking lot along the shoreline flanked by coconut palms, rolling dunes and very surfable waves.  Praia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil  Spiaggia di Guvano, Vernazza, Italy  Located on the gorgeous Cinque Terre, this primo Italian nude beach looks like something out of a movie (think \u201cSwept Away \u201d \u2013 the 1974 version directed by Lina Wertm\u00fcller.) Adding to the beach\u2019s mystique is the fact that it can only be reached via kayak or motorboat or hiking down a steep and somewhat treacherous trail that involves scrambling over rocks.  Guvano is totally primitive, with no facilities of any kind, so bear this in mind when planning your visit. The beach is also pebble rather than sand, but the water is clear, clean and gorgeous.   Spiaggia di Guvano, 19018 Vernazza, SP, Italy  Vecaki Beach, Riga, Latvia Edged with pine trees, this Latvian beach is as calming as it is beautiful.  Based close to the capital city of Riga and a relatively short walk from Vecaki train station, it\u2019s known for its shimmering waters, stunning sunsets and of course, its nudist section. The zone, which happens to be the biggest nudist beach area in the country, includes a beach volleyball area that\u2019s a big hit with local residents. Vecaki Beach, Selgas iela 20, Riga 1030, Latvia  Haulover Beach Park, Miami, Florida The most popular public nude beach in the United States, Haulover attracts more than 1.3 million bare bottomed people to its white sands and warm water each year.  The clothing-optional portion, marked at either end by picket fences, offers rental beach chairs and umbrellas, as well as lifeguards.  Given the stellar weather in south Florida, there\u2019s usually someone in the buff on any given day.  But the biggest crowds gather during National Nude Recreation Week in July and whenever Haulover is trying to set a new Guinness World Record for skinny dipping.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_weather_west-heatwave-wildfires-california-butte", "text": "The West is sizzling under a major, prolonged heatwave through July 4 and beyond that\u2019s bringing triple-digit temperatures and fueling wildfire risk as thousands have had to flee their homes from an advancing Northern California blaze. The Thompson Fire has consumed over 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday, drawing hundreds of firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat in the Oroville, California, area. As of Thursday morning, the fire is 7% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fire has injured 11 firefighters, according to Chris Peterson, a California Fire spokesperson. Heat-related illnesses have affected eight firefighters, who have been evaluated and are in the process of being cleared, Peterson said. Three other firefighters were hurt when a fire engine was involved in a rollover accident Wednesday morning, Peterson said. All three were taken to the hospital and two have since been released. As of Thursday morning, 12,000 residents living in and around Oroville remain under evacuation orders, Peterson said. At least four structures have been destroyed and more than 12,000 remain threatened by the fire, according to a Cal Fire\u00a0incident update. Oroville resident Rachael Thompson could see the flames and smoke from her backyard before she and three of her\u00a0family\u00a0members fled their home\u00a0Tuesday night. \u201cIt was a rough night for our\u00a0family,\u201d Thompson\u00a0told CNN\u00a0in\u00a0a message.\u00a0\u201cThe smoke\u00a0in\u00a0our home was\u00a0incredibly bad even with 4 purifiers going.\u201d Though she has since received word that the fire has moved away from her home, she worries for her neighbors and friends, many of whom are displaced and don\u2019t know if their homes are still standing. \u201cWe hope our friends and\u00a0family\u2019s homes make it and that they\u2019re all safe,\u201d she said. Californians are all too familiar with the sudden devastation that wildfires bring. The Thompson Fire is burning just 20 miles south of Paradise, where California\u2019s deadliest wildfire killed 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. There are now over two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest, according to Cal Fire. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing fires on the coast in San Diego, to the foothills in Butte,\u201d Cal Fire Deputy Director Nick Schuler told CNN Wednesday. \u201cOur\u00a0firefighters are battling fires across California and often times on the line for more than 24 hours. It\u2019s difficult conditions that they face.\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the area of the Thompson Fire Wednesday, clearing the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with 139,590 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 7,812 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen so far in California \u2013 more than 600% increase in wildfires,\u201d Schuler told CNN. The extreme heat is combining with gusty winds and low humidity to set the stage for rapid fire spread through already parched vegetation, and it represents another obstacle for firefighters battling the blaze. Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the Thompson Fire zone. \u201cThis winter we enjoyed a lot of precipitation and that brought a lot of vegetation that was green just a few weeks ago,\u201d Schuler said. \u201cNow, with that heat increased temperatures drying out, resulting in rapid fire growth across the state.\u201d The Basin Fire in California\u2019s Fresno County is 46% contained at 13,980 acres. Meanwhile, firefighters have the Fresno June Lightning Complex nearly fully contained to 10,669 acres. \u201cFirefighters are likely to have a very challenging week ahead,\u201d Cal Fire officials said in a video update Tuesday. \u201cAll it takes is one spark to start a major wildfire putting lives at risk.\u201d Oroville will see\u00a0record temperatures of 110 or more each of the next five days. Saturday may reach an\u00a0all-time record high of 113 \u2013 making it that much harder for fire crews to fight the blaze. No relief from the extreme heat for days Record-breaking heat is making the Fourth of July week a dangerous one across much of the West and from the southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic. Nationwide, more than 140 million people across more than 20 states in parts of the South and West are under heat alerts \u2013 and there will be no relief until the middle of next week. \u201cThe duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cHeat impacts can compound over time, therefore it is important to remain weather aware and follow the advice of local officials.\u201d Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of Oregon will also experience triple digits Friday, and the heat could last up to five days with noted poor overnight relief, says the National Weather Service Portland. Jessica Vega Pederson, chair of Multnomah Country, declared a state of emergency effective this weekend, noted a news release from the county Wednesday. Multnomah County\u2019s health officer, Dr. Richard Bruno, said in a news release: \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend. They\u2019ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.\u201d Multnomah County is the state\u2019s most populous county and home to Portland, where Mayor Ted Wheeler has also declared a state of emergency. Starting Friday, the cities of Hood River, Portland and Salem are all forecast for temperatures of 100 Fahrenheit over a five-day span, according to the National Weather Service. Eugene will face a four-day stretch of 100 Fahrenheit temps. Noah Alviz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service of Portland, told CNN via phone: \u201cIn June 2021, for a heatwave here in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington \u2026 Portland reached an all-time record of 116. Now, with this heatwave, we\u2019re not expecting temperatures to get as intense as that. However, what we are more concerned about is the duration of this heatwave.\u201d During the summer of 2021, Multnomah County reported 72 heat deaths with \u201call but three of those deaths resulting from a single five-day heat wave in June,\u201d according to the county. \u201cThat is a big concern from us when we see heat of this magnitude in our area,\u201d Alviz said. There is the additional concern of staying cool in an area where many don\u2019t have air conditioning, Alviz says, which has resulted in the opening of numerous cooling shelters in Multnomah County. Meanwhile, much of California, excluding the coastal regions, as well as western Nevada and southwestern Arizona, are expected to see searing high temperatures from 100 to 110 degrees \u2013 about 10 to 20 degrees above normal. Las Vegas, Nevada, could exceed its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees Sunday or Monday, and Death Valley, California, could approach 130 degrees by Sunday. As the heat dome expands north, above-normal temperatures are expected to hit parts of Oregon and Washington beginning Friday, with high temperatures ranging between 95 to 105 degrees.  Some cities could swelter through multiple days of temperatures well above 100 degrees with some, including Sacramento, potentially\u00a0seeing a full week of highs over 105 degrees. Already, several cities have set or tied daily high-temperature records, with Fresno and Livermore both hitting 110 degrees Wednesday. Heat\u00a0is expected to spread to\u00a0the\u00a0Northwest and to parts of Arizona\u00a0including Phoenix by\u00a0the\u00a0weekend, where triple-digit temperatures are expected, with parts of Arizona\u00a0seeing highs above 110 degrees.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/weather/west-heatwave-wildfires-california-butte/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

The officials, most of whom spoke anonymously to \u201cdiscuss sensitive security matters,\u201d also said a truce would be the most effective way to secure the release of the Israeli hostages. Former Israeli National Security Advisor Eyal Hulata, who according to the Times maintains regular communication with \u201csenior miliary officials,\u201d spoke on the record, saying, \u201cThe military is in full support of a hostage deal and a ceasefire \u2026 They believe that they can always go back and engage Hamas militarily in the future.\u201d Faced with a \u201cforever war\u201d scenario, four of the officials interviewed by the Times agreed with Hulata that \u201ckeeping Hamas in power for now in exchange for getting the hostages back seems like the least worst option for Israel.\u201d But in a statement, Netanyahu said, \u201cI do not know who these anonymous sources are, but I am here to make it unequivocally clear: This will not happen. The war will end once Israel achieves all of its objectives, including the destruction of Hamas and the release of all of our hostages.\u201d \u201cThe government directed the IDF to achieve these war objectives and the IDF has all the means to achieve them. We will not capitulate to the winds of defeatism, neither in The New York Times nor anywhere else. We are inspired by the spirit of victory.\u201d The report was published as the situation in Israel\u2019s north remains extremely tense, with the Israeli military and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah ramping up cross-border attacks, which risk boiling\u00a0over into a full-scale war. \u201cThey (the IDF) understand that a pause in Gaza makes de-escalation more likely in Lebanon,\u201d Hulata told the Times. \u201cAnd they have less munitions, less spare parts, less energy than they did before \u2014 so they also think a pause in Gaza gives us more time to prepare in case a bigger war does break out with Hezbollah,\u201d he is quoted as saying. When asked by the Times if it supported a truce, the IDF released a statement that didn\u2019t answer the question directly. \u201cThe IDF is determined to continue fighting to achieve the goals of the war to destroy the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas, the return of the hostages and the safe return of the residents in the north and south to their homes.\u201d \u201cSo far, significant achievements have been made in fighting in Gaza, the IDF will continue to fight Hamas everywhere in the Gaza Strip, along with continuing to promote war readiness in the north and a defense effort at all borders,\u201d it added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/middleeast/netanyahu-rejects-hamas-ceasefire-hezbollah-war-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

They were swiftly and safely recovered,\u201d an Army spokesperson told CNN in a statement. \u201cOne horse received minor injuries, but no further treatment is required and there were no injuries to the soldiers involved,\u201d the statement added. The animals bolted from Seville Street to South Eaton Place, where one horse was recovered. Two horses continued to Vauxhall Bridge via Belgrave Road before being stopped. Footage posted by a London black cab driver showed two of the horse running in front of his vehicle. The Ministry of Defence confirmed all horses were collected and returned to Hyde Park Barracks by 9:55 a.m. (4:55 a.m. ET). The Household Cavalry acts as the King\u2019s official bodyguard and take part in ceremonial duties. It is based at Hyde Park barracks, a short distance from Buckingham Palace. None of the horses that escaped on Monday were involved in the previous incident on April 24. There were startling scenes just over two months ago when several horses covered in blood, ran through streets in London\u2019s financial district. On that occasion, six soldiers and seven horses from the Life Guards, part of the Household Cavalry, were conducting an extended exercise when the incident took place. Five horses were spooked when some concrete fell off a conveyor belt being used in nearby construction work and hit the ground, according to the Army. Following that incident, the injured soldiers and horses received expert emergency medical care, with the animals put under constant supervision by the Army\u2019s veterinary surgeons. Three of the horses injured during the rampage - Trojan, Tennyson, and Vanquish - have since returned to duty and most recently participated in the King\u2019s birthday parade. The remaining two horses have been convalescing in the countryside and will \u201creturn to work in due course,\u201d according to an update from the Army in early June. This was a developing story and has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/uk/london-military-horses-bolt-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a Telegram post, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed the plot organizers planned to trigger\u00a0a riot\u00a0in Kyiv on June 30 as a distraction to seize control of the Ukrainian parliament and remove the military and political leadership from power. It is unclear\u00a0how viable the planned plot was, or\u00a0if those accused have any connection with Russia, which has waged a devastating full-scale invasion against its southwestern neighbor for nearly two and a half years. Four suspects have been identified, with two\u00a0held in custody, the SBU said.\u00a0They\u00a0face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. The SBU said it seized weapons and ammunition, as well as cellphones, computers and other records \u201cwith evidence of criminal action.\u201d The office of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general said the alleged leader of the plot \u201cis\u00a0a head of a non-governmental entity, who already had the experience of participating in fruitless provocative events.\u201d The suspect rented a hall with a capacity of 2,000 people\u00a0and was looking to recruit military personnel and armed guards from private companies to \u201ccarry out the seizure\u201d\u00a0of\u00a0parliament, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. It is unclear if authorities are seeking any more suspects. \u201cTo implement the criminal plan, the main organizer involved several accomplices\u2014representatives of the community organizations from Kyiv, Dnipro, and other regions,\u201d the SBU said. The alleged scheme in Kyiv comes as Russia has made slow but steady battlefield gains in recent months, exploiting Ukraine\u2019s diminishing manpower and\u00a0reliance on the West for weapons\u00a0\u2013 and uncertainty over the future of that military aid. Russian forces killed seven people, including three children, in a missile strike on the southern town of Vilniansk Saturday, according to Ukrainian officials, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to\u00a0appeal for more long-range weapons. \u201cI am grateful to all partners who are helping. And the decisions we need must be accelerated. Any delay in decisions in this war means losing human lives,\u201d Zelensky wrote on Telegram.

During last week\u2019s presidential debate, Trump questioned whether the United States should continue to fund Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia.

French President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u2019s centrist alliance was crushed on Sunday\u00a0after the far-right National Rally (RN) party\u00a0surged in the first round of the country\u2019s parliamentary elections. Once seen as a fringe movement the\u00a0RN\u00a0could\u00a0now\u00a0be positioned to assume power, after winning 33% of the vote. It would then\u00a0become the first far-right party to enter the French government since\u00a0World War\u00a0II\u00a0\u2013 although nothing is certain\u00a0ahead of Sunday\u2019s\u00a0second round. The left-wing alliance, New Popular Front, also did well,\u00a0coming\u00a0second with 28% of the vote. Meanwhile,\u00a0Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance trailed\u00a0in third place with 21% of the vote, leaving many in his camp to ponder why the president called the snap election in the first place. \u201cTonight is not a night like any other,\u201d\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0Gabriel Attal said solemnly in an address to the French. \u201cThe far-right are at the gates of power.\u201d There\u2019s a long way to go in this election yet, however,\u00a0so\u00a0what happens next? Three rival blocs Only 76 candidates were elected to the 577-seat parliament on Sunday:\u00a039\u00a0from the RN and its allies, 32 from the New Popular Front, and just two lawmakers from Macron\u2019s alliance. The rest of the seats\u00a0will be\u00a0decided in the second round next weekend, and huge amounts of\u00a0political bargaining and maneuvering\u00a0are\u00a0expected before\u00a0then.\u00a0This could\u00a0determine whether a\u00a0truly\u00a0seismic shift is underway in French politics,\u00a0and\u00a0the landscape\u00a0is\u00a0now divided between three rival blocs. It\u2019s created an unprecedented situation, with a record number of three-way races poised to take place\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0\u2013\u00a0306 compared with only\u00a0eight\u00a0in 2022. Only\u00a0those\u00a0candidates who make it past the 12.5% threshold make it to the runoff. Typically, most constituencies only see two candidates go through, but this year, around half will see three candidates proceed to the next round\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a first in France\u2019s modern history. Those three-way races benefit candidates who came out on top in the first round and with the RN in a lead position in over half of the runoffs, some parties are strategizing to block the far-right. They don\u2019t have much time, as candidates need\u00a0to decide\u00a0whether\u00a0they will\u00a0run or not before Tuesday night. The\u00a0left-wing New Popular Front has announced that it will withdraw all candidates who came in third to help prevent far-right candidates from getting elected. Macron\u2019s alliance has not been as clear with only his prime minister insisting that \u201cnot one vote should go to the far-right.\u201d Ultimately, it all remains just guidance \u2013 withdrawing or not is up to the individual candidates, and voters will make their own choices. A grenade to global order This parliamentary election has captivated people domestically \u2013 the exceptional turnout\u00a0of 67%\u00a0speaks for itself, but the rest of the world should pay close attention too. Far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen\u2019s RN party\u00a0is notoriously euroskeptic, and though it no longer talks of a full-blown \u201cFrexit,\u201d\u00a0or French departure from the European Union,\u00a0its manifesto puts into question the very foundations of the European project. The\u00a0RN\u00a0has made it clear it would seek to weaken the union, and regain\u00a0more\u00a0control of its borders and sovereignty. Once in power, and with Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban as far-right allies, their plans for Europe could carry a lot more weight. If the\u00a0RN\u00a0does dominate parliament, it will also be good news for\u00a0Russian President Vladmir\u00a0Putin.\u00a0Le Pen has also only briefly criticized Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, having also previously taken a huge loan from a Russian bank and boasted\u00a0of\u00a0her \u201cadmiration for Vladimir Putin.\u201d Ahead of the election, Le Pen questioned the role of the president in military affairs.\u00a0Macron has pledged to see out the remainder of his final presidential term, which runs until 2027.\u00a0Constitutionally, the president heads the army, and Macron has not eliminated the possibility of sending French troops to Ukraine. Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader of RN, has categorically said that as prime minister, he would not let any French soldier set foot in Ukraine, throwing the French constitutional order into question. In 2022, Le Pen also\u00a0said she\u00a0wanted to leave the military wing of NATO \u2013 but her party has since backtracked,\u00a0saying that wouldn\u2019t happen as long as the war in Ukraine is ongoing. Macron\u2019s party is already governing in\u00a0the country\u2019s lower house, the National Assembly,\u00a0without a majority after its poorer-than-expected showing in the 2022 legislative elections, forcing it either to seek out coalitions to pass legislation, or use a constitutional tool to force through new laws. But falling behind to either the left or right could be the death knell to his agenda. A loss would force Macron to nominate a prime minister from whichever party wins \u2013 putting a political opponent in charge of running the government. Bardella has said that he would only govern if his party wins an absolute majority \u2013 and with the first round suggesting none of the parties will win those 289 necessary seats, there is no obvious prime minister in sight. It could be a political deadlock in France for at least the next year \u2013\u00a0and a\u00a0crisis for President Macron, arguably of his own making.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/europe/france-far-right-brink-of-power-what-next-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

The National Women\u2019s Soccer League\u2019s (NWSL) club described statements about it and its president as \u201cinaccurate and defamatory,\u201d and said it would pursue \u201call legal avenues available to appropriately address this matter.\u201d The statement, which is signed by Alvarado, also claimed club president Jill Ellis \u201cfostered an environment where abusive behaviors among her subordinates are allowed to flourish.\u201d Alvarado also called for the National Women\u2019s Soccer League NWSL to remove Ellis from San Diego and the league, saying the treatment under her has \u201cbeen nothing short of life-altering and devastating to our mental health.\u201d CNN cannot verify any of Alvarado\u2019s claims and has reached out to her for comment. Ellis said Wednesday that mental health is a \u201cpriority\u201d at the club and they \u201chave support measures\u201d for any employee that might need it. \u201cOur staff and I will always honor how someone feels,\u201d Ellis said in a statement to CNN via the club. \u201cOver time, we have actively responded to employees who have shown or expressed needs related to their mental health. I want to reinforce that Wave FC has a robust Employee Assistance Program that is promoted regularly to employees. \u201cI will continue to protect former and current employee confidentiality. When allegations of mistreatment have been made, we have taken them seriously and investigated them thoroughly. \u201cIn addition, when appropriate, independent third parties have assisted us in evaluating our workplace. At no time have those evaluations uncovered any wrongdoing by the club. \u201cWhat we do is all about fostering a culture of respect, inclusivity, and excellence. The false accusations in today\u2019s post are not only personally damaging but also take away from the incredible work and progress we\u2019ve achieved together as a team. It\u2019s important to address this information promptly and effectively. \u201cOur focus remains on moving forward and continuing to build a strong, unified club.\u201d Ellis served as the head coach of the United States Women\u2019s National Team (USWNT) from 2014-2019 where she helped lead the team to two World Cup championships in 2015 and 2019. The 57-year-old was named the inaugural president of the Wave in 2021 ahead of its debut season. Alvarado, who was a video and creative manager for the club, said she resigned from the club on June 7 and that she received an email 10 days later from an unnamed senior leadership member calling her \u201cthe most pathetic person I\u2019ve ever met\u201d and that they were \u201cestatic that you are no longer with the club.\u201d The Wave called the email \u201cfabricated\u201d and denounced the allegations against Ellis as \u201ccategorically false.\u201d Alvarado also criticized the league, saying it \u201cconsistently failed to take meaningful action\u201d and \u201cturned a blind eye to a pattern of profoundly damaging behaviors\u201d\u00a0within the Wave.  An NWSL spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that the \u201csafety, health, and well-being of everyone associated with our league is our highest priority. \u201cWe take serious any and every report of potential misconduct, hire qualified independent investigators to review those allegations thoroughly, and act when allegations are supported by the facts uncovered. \u201cWe have mandated corrective action in every instance where reports have been corroborated, up to and including the removal of individuals who do not live up to our values and standards.\u201d The league added that they \u201cencourage anyone with information of potential wrongdoing to report that misconduct to the League Safety Officer. Alternatively, individuals may report anonymously via Real Response, by texting 872-259-6975.\u201d Current Wave striker and two-time Women\u2019s World Cup winner Alex Morgan said she was \u201cdisappointed to hear about the allegations.\u201d \u201cAs players, we have worked hard to build a team that is surrounded by an inclusive, positive and safe environment,\u201d the 35-year-old wrote on X. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to me that we are creating that environment for both players AND staff throughout the entire organization. Equity in the workplace is something I have and will continue to advocate for. \u201cI want to be proud of what we are building at the Wave but it is clear that there is so much work to be done.\u201d In December 2022, the NWSL and its players\u2019 union released a 128-page independent investigation report following a 14-month inquiry into accusations of \u201cdiscrimination, harassment, abuse (physical, emotional or sexual) and retaliation\u201d within the women\u2019s professional league. The joint investigative team, which included members from two law firms, found \u201cwidespread misconduct directed at NWSL players\u201d by those in positions of power.

Labour was forecast to win\u00a0410 seats,\u00a0while the Conservatives will drop to just\u00a0131 seats,\u00a0according to the exit poll, a rejection of the ruling party by Britain\u2019s electorate that had been anticipated for months. The exit poll was conducted by Ipsos for the BBC, ITV and Sky, and has historically been an accurate barometer of how the country has voted. Votes will be counted throughout the night, with Starmer likely to replace Rishi Sunak as prime minister on Friday. The expected results fall short of some, more dramatic predictions made by pollsters during the campaign. But they mark a severe collapse by the Tories since the last election, in 2019, when former Prime Minister Boris Johnson led the party to a landslide victory. Since then the party has descended into a bitter internal war, slumping from leader to leader and scandal to scandal. Starmer pinned his disciplined campaign on a one-word promise \u2013 \u201cChange\u201d \u2013 and benefited from a woeful Tory pitch that failed to reverse the public\u2019s deep reservations about their performance. The Liberal Democrats were forecast to win\u00a061 seats,\u00a0according to the exit poll,\u00a0and will return as Britain\u2019s third-strongest party in Westminster.\u00a0Reform UK, a right-wing populist group, were forecast\u00a013 seats\u00a0and the Green Party were forecast\u00a0two. Starmer, a former barrister who entered parliament in 2015 and has dragged his party towards the center ground since taking over as leader in 2020, has pledged to revive Britain\u2019s flagging public services while keeping a tight lid on expenditure. His victory provides an antidote to a rise of populist sentiment across Europe. But populism played a part in the story of the campaign. The insurgent Reform UK group, led by Nigel Farage, have torn away voters from the Conservatives on an anti-migration pitch, while the Tories lost centrist support in England\u2019s affluent southern regions to the Lib Dems. Starmer seems set to win fewer seats than Tony Blair did in his 1997 landslide \u2013 the last time Labour ousted the Conservatives in an election \u2013 but he will  rule with a strong parliamentary majority. While he does, a battle will rage for control of the opposition. Right-wing Tories have made overtures towards Farage\u2019s bloc during the campaign, but have faced opposition from moderate Conservatives keen to once again moor the party in Britain\u2019s political center. On key foreign policy issues, including Britain\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the handover of power is not expected to change policy; Starmer has committed to continuing Britain\u2019s supportive stance towards Kyiv. He has called for a ceasefire in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza, and a simultaneous return of Israeli hostages held by the militant group.

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England. In 1995, it was stolen from Longleat, the home of Thynne\u2019s descendants, and disappeared for seven years, before it was found at a bus stop in London by art detective Charles Hill.

Carlo Acutis, who died from leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, was renowned for using his computing skills to spread awareness of the Catholic faith and earned the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s influencer.\u201d Being recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church can take decades, but the cause of Acutis has moved swiftly, with the teenager developing a\u00a0devoted following across the world. Often depicted wearing jeans and trainers,\u00a0his story is seen as helpful for the Catholic Church as it seeks to better connect with\u00a0the\u00a0younger generation in a digital age,\u00a0and he\u2019s become popular with Catholic youth groups. The church\u2019s sainthood process normally requires that candidates have two miracles attributed to them, with each alleged supernatural occurrence requiring in-depth examination. In May, a second miracle attributed to Acutis was\u00a0recognized by Pope Francis, a decision which paved the way for him to be declared a saint. That left one final step,\u00a0completed\u00a0Monday, when\u00a0the Vatican announced\u00a0the pope had decreed the\u00a0canonization would go ahead after cardinals convened by the pope\u00a0voted in favor of Acutis\u2019 sainthood,\u00a0along with 14 others. The date for his canonization\u00a0is yet to be set, however, although it is likely to occur at\u00a0some point during the Catholic Church\u2019s jubilee year celebrations in 2025. That canonization ceremony, expected to take place in St Peter\u2019s Square in Vatican City in front of tens of thousands and presided over by the pope, will be the moment where Acutis is formally declared a saint, meaning the Catholic Church across the world can name parishes and schools after the teenager and will remember him annually on a \u201cfeast day.\u201d Acutis, who was born in London, United Kingdom, in 1991\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0putting\u00a0him\u00a0squarely\u00a0in the millennial generation cohort\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is remembered by friends and family as enjoying playing video games such as Halo, Super Mario and Pok\u00e9mon. During his short life, he also set up a website\u00a0documenting reports of miracles\u00a0taking place in different parts of the world. Along\u00a0with his computing and gaming, Acutis played the saxophone, enjoyed soccer, loved animals and would make short, humorous films of his dogs. His mother, Antonia Salzano,\u00a0described her son as a \u201csign of hope\u201d who shows that holiness is possible today. \u201cAs I did,\u00a0you too can become holy,\u201d\u00a0she told CNN\u00a0in May.\u00a0\u201cNevertheless, (with) all the media,\u00a0the technologies,\u00a0it seems sometimes that holiness is something that belongs to the past. Instead, holiness is also something nowadays in this modern time.\u201d She said that her son was bought a PlayStation when he was eight, but limited himself to one hour a week of gaming as he was wary that it could become addictive and\u00a0knew the \u201cdangers of the internet.\u201d Salzano added that from the age of nine, the youngster spent time helping the homeless in Milan and giving his pocket money to those sleeping on the streets. She explained that he insisted on only having one pair of shoes, so he could save money to help the poor. Acutis was beatified and declared \u201cblessed\u201d in 2020 after his first miracle, when he reportedly healed a Brazilian boy who had a birth defect in his pancreas that left him unable to eat food normally.\u00a0He was reportedly healed after his mother said she prayed to Acutis to intercede and help heal her son. The second miracle attributed to Acutis relates to the reported healing of a girl from Costa Rica who had suffered a head trauma after falling from her bicycle in Florence, Italy, where she was studying. Her mother said she prayed for her daughter\u2019s recovery at the tomb of Acutis in Assisi.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/europe/carlo-acutis-canonized-first-millennial-saint-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_23_uk_uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl", "text": "Voters in Britain are primed to end a 14-year era of Conservative rule, in a momentous general election that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is almost universally expected to lose. Sunak took the biggest gamble of his troubled premiership by calling the early vote, but he has struggled to turn around dire polling and appears on the cusp of defeat. If, as current polls indicate, the opposition Labour party triumph, it will finally bring down the curtain of a 14-year era of Conservative rule, ushering in a center-left government led by former barrister Keir Starmer. Any other outcome would mean Sunak has orchestrated a shocking victory that even many in his own party believe is beyond reach \u2013 and would result in the Conservatives extending a political dynasty towards a third decade. Here are some key questions answered. When and how is Britain voting? After a weeks-long campaign, polls will open at 7 a.m. local time on Thursday (2 a.m. ET), and they\u2019ll stay open until 10 p.m. Britons can cast a ballot in each of the country\u2019s 650 constituencies, selecting the MP to represent the area. The leader of the party that wins a majority of those constituencies becomes prime minister, and can form a government. That means 326 is the magic number for an overall majority. If there\u2019s no majority, they need to look for help elsewhere, ruling as a minority government \u2013 as Theresa May did after a close 2017 result \u2013 or forming a coalition, as David Cameron did after 2010. The monarch has an important, albeit symbolic, role; King Charles III must approve the formation of a government, the decision to hold an election and the dissolution of parliament. The King won\u2019t ever contradict his prime minister or overrule the results of an election. Why did Sunak call an election? Sunak was required to call a vote by January 2025, but the decision of when to do so was his alone. His problem was that no good options existed. He was 20 points behind in the polls, and that deficit hadn\u2019t budged for months. Some in his ear urged him to wait until later in the year, when poor economic news could improve. But on the other hand, Sunak has placed much of his political capital into his pledge to stop small boat crossings to the UK by asylum seekers. He has recently passed a controversial law to process some claims in Rwanda, though nobody has yet been deported and further legal challenges may await the plan. The warmer summer months are expected to see a huge number of such journeys across the English Channel, hurting a major pillar of his campaign message. Ultimately, hours after some rare good economic news \u2013 a healthy month-on-month reduction in the rate of inflation \u2013 Sunak decided that this was the least bad time to pull the trigger. But his speech, which took place in a downpour outside Downing Street, set the tone for a miserable campaign. Who\u2019s expected to win? The near-universal expectation is that Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party will lose the election. Labour have been leading in general election opinion polls since late 2021, and that lead has been huge throughout the campaign. They are around 20 points up on average, with the Tories closer to third party challengers Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a Labour win so huge it would spell a near-wipeout for the Conservatives. The Conservative brand was damaged by Partygate and a number of other scandals that led to the demise of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, and then the shambolic six-week tenure of his successor Liz Truss, whose fiscal agenda sent markets into turmoil. Sunak\u2019s campaign has even shifted its message in recent weeks, encouraging supporters instead to prevent a massive Labour majority than to send Sunak back to Downing Street. It\u2019s essentially an admission of defeat, and underlines what polling has said for some time: Labour is firmly on course for victory. But the Labour party is concerned about people taking the result for granted, and have stressed in recent days that nothing is decided until the votes are counted. How has the campaign gone? Starmer and Sunak have faced off in two head-to-head TV debates, which were at times ill-tempered and featured contentious claims \u2013 particularly an assertion by Sunak that Labour would cost Britons thousands in new taxes, which Labour have ruled out. Labour\u2019s campaign has been otherwise focused, hammering home a promise of \u201cchange\u201d while pledging prudence with the nation\u2019s finances. Sunak has meanwhile struggled to stay on track; in particular a decision to leave D-Day anniversary commemorations early caused fury back home and prompted an apology. Two head-to-head TV debates have been organized; in the first, Sunak and Starmer scrapped in a tense and occasionally personal tie. The second will air in late June. Then on Thursday, July 4, Britons will vote between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, and as soon as polls close, votes will be counted. A winner is usually declared in the early hours of Friday morning. Who is Keir Starmer? Rishi Sunak\u2019s rival for power is Labour leader Keir Starmer, who is heavily favored to become Britain\u2019s new prime minister in July. A former, well-respected human rights lawyer who then served as Britain\u2019s most senior prosecutor, Starmer came into politics late in life. He became a Labour MP in 2015 and less than five years later was the party\u2019s leader, following a stint as shadow Brexit Secretary during Britain\u2019s protracted exit from the European Union. Starmer inherited a party reeling from its worst electoral defeat in generations, but he prioritized an overhaul of its culture \u2013 staring down left-wing supporters of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, and apologizing publicly for a long-running antisemitism scandal that had tainted the group\u2019s standing with the public. He has attempted to lay claim to Britain\u2019s political center ground, and is described by his supporters as a principled, serious leader with a focus on tackling the systemic issues facing Britain. But his opponents, on both the left of his own party and the right of the political spectrum, say he lacks charisma and ideas, and charge that he has failed to set out an ambitious and broad vision for the nation. Who else is standing? Only Sunak or Starmer have a realistic chance of becoming prime minister, but their plans could be disrupted by a number of smaller parties. Nigel Farage, the populist right-wing figurehead who leads Reform UK, announced he would stand for election early in the campaign \u2013 he previously declined to do so, in order to help former President Donald Trump campaign in the US election this fall \u2013 and his entry has helped the group peel away Tory support. Farage has criticized Sunak\u2019s record on migration, and his group has pulled close to the Tories in many polls. Holding on to that level of support come election day could cause a once-in-a-lifetime decimation of the Tories at the ballot box. Meanwhile, as Farage attacks Sunak from the right, the Liberal Democrats, a centrist, pro-European group, have chipped away at Conservative support in affluent, southern parts of England. Given Labour\u2019s standing in the polls, Starmer is more equipped to take the fight to other groups. North of the border, he will look to end the Scottish National Party (SNP)\u2019s generation-long dominance at the ballot box, capitalizing on a rocky period in the party\u2019s recent history that has seen them replace two leaders in just over a year. But he will need to be mindful of the Green Party, which has challenged him from the left and has attracted some younger liberal votes as a result. In recent local elections, there was evidence too that Labour\u2019s stance on Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza had harmed the party in majority-Muslim areas. What issues will decide the election? The answer to that question will go some way in deciding the night\u2019s winner. Labour has been dogged in trying to define the election as a referendum on 14 years of Conservative rule, seizing on public fatigue with a party that has produced five prime ministers in that span and overseen Brexit, a stuttering economy and a series of sleaze scandals. In particular, Starmer has spoken plenty about the cost of living hitting British families, and the state of the country\u2019s overstaffed and stretched National Health Service (NHS). Sunak, by contrast, has tried to focus on migration \u2013 his pledge to \u201cStop the Boats\u201d hasn\u2019t yet worked, but his flagship Rwanda policy has at least become law. And he has attempted to convince voters that the economy has turned a corner, and can\u2019t risk a change in governance. When will we know the results? Once polls open on Thursday, the media in Britain is barred from discussing anything that could affect voting. But the second voting stops, an exit poll will drop that sets the course for the night. The poll, done by Ipsos for the BBC, ITV and Sky, projects the seat breakdown of the new parliament, and it\u2019s historically been very accurate. The real results are counted throughout the night; the shape of the evening is usually clear by about 3 a.m. local time (10 p.m. ET on Thursday), and the new prime minister \u2013 if there is one \u2013 is often in post by noon. But things can take longer if the result is close, or if key seats go down to the wire. Either way, the infamously sudden handover in power will take place by the weekend, leaving the new government a few weeks to work on key legislation before parliament breaks for the summer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/uk/uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a statement, Taiwan\u2019s coast guard said the fishing boat, Tachinman 88, was intercepted by two Chinese coast guard vessels near the Kinmen islands, which lie just miles from the Chinese cities of Xiamen and Quanzhou. All five crew members were also detained, according to Taiwan authorities. China coast guard officers boarded the fishing boat and then escorted it to a nearby Chinese port,\u00a0the Taiwanese statement said, adding that three Taiwan coast guard\u00a0vessels answered a call for help but retreated to avoid conflict when they were outnumbered by their Chinese counterparts. China\u2019s coast guard confirmed it detained the boat, saying in a statement Wednesday that  its Fujian division had \u201clawfully boarded, inspected and detained a Taiwanese fishing vessel suspected of illegal fishing in the offshore waters near Quanzhou.\u201d China coast guard spokesperson Liu Dejun accused the Taiwanese boat of violating a summer fishing moratorium by operating trawl nets in a prohibited area and using nets with mesh sizes much smaller than China\u2019s national minimum requirements, thereby \u201cdamaging marine fisheries resources and the ecological environment.\u201d The Chinese statement did not mention the status of the crew members. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to unify with the island, by force if necessary. And Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taipei since President Lai Ching-te, who it openly loathes as a \u201cdangerous separatist,\u201d won the island\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party a historic third consecutive term in power in January. Meanwhile, tensions remain high in the waters around\u00a0Kinmen, a group of outlying islands controlled by Taiwan but nestled just a stone\u2019s throw from the shores of China. In a news conference Wednesday, a senior Taiwan maritime official\u00a0said the Taiwanese vessel was detained amid an annual summer fishing ban implemented by China\u00a0in May. Two Taiwanese and three Indonesian crew members were detained as the boat\u00a0operated 11.2 nautical miles from the mainland coast in China\u2019s territorial waters, said Hsieh Ching-chin, deputy director general of Taiwan\u2019s Coast Guard Administration. The Taiwan coast guard demanded the immediate release of the boat and crew. \u201cThe Coast Guard Administration calls on China not to engage in political manipulation, which undermines cross-strait relations, and it should release the Tachinman 88 vessel and its crew immediately,\u201d the Taiwanese statement said. China\u2019s coast guard has increased patrols in waters around Kinmen and other outlying islands controlled by Taiwan since February, when two Chinese fishermen were drowned while being chased by Taiwan\u2019s coast guard, who accused them of trespassing. In late February, Chinese coast guard officers intercepted and boarded a Taiwanese tourist boat for inspection, an unprecedented move that startled Taiwanese passengers. Taiwanese legislator Chen Yu-jen, who represents Kinmen for Taiwan\u2019s opposition Kuomintang party, said since then, fishermen in the islands had been careful not to cross into China\u2019s territorial waters due to Chinese coast guard patrols. \u201cBoth sides of the Taiwan Strait do not currently have a warm relationship, so we should be more careful about staying inside our own waters,\u201d she told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cIn the past, the coast guard would usually expel fishing vessels that crossed the maritime border, but now it is strictly enforcing the law.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/asia/china-detains-taiwan-fishing-boat-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_04_middleeast_iran-presidential-election-round-two-pezeshkian-jalili-intl", "text": "Iran\u2019s snap presidential election will head to a second vote on Friday, with a reformist and conservative hardliner facing off to replace Ebrahim Raisi amid unprecedented voter apathy. After none of the four initial candidates secured more than 50% of the vote on June 28, reformist lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili emerged as the two candidates with the most votes, with Pezeshkian leading by 3.9 percentage points. The first round, however, saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979, highlighting the discontent among a population losing faith in the country\u2019s ruling clerical establishment. Pezeshkian and Jalili are on opposite ends of the Iranian political spectrum. Each candidate could lead Iran in a starkly different manner at a time when the Islamic Republic is grappling with delicate domestic and international problems \u2013 including an economy in tatters, a restive youth movement and escalating tensions with Israel and the United States. Here\u2019s what to expect on Friday\u2019 second round of elections, and how the results could impact Iran and the world. What happened in the first round? The snap election was held after Raisi died in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the country\u2019s remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials. Three conservatives and a single reformist candidate vied  for the country\u2019s top elected seat, after dozens of other candidates were barred from standing by the powerful 12-member Guardian Council, which is tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, and reports directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. During the first round, Pezeshkian led with 42.5% of the votes, followed by Jalili with 38.6%, according to the state news agency IRNA. Out of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40% turnout. The record low turnout \u2013 in a country where presidential elections usually command more than 60% \u2013\u00a0came despite Khamenei urging Iranians to show \u201cmaximum participation\u201d in order to strengthen the Islamic Republic against its adversaries. Iranians who spoke to CNN in Tehran ahead of the first vote expressed little faith in the those running, especially as candidates are vetted by the Guardian Council. The turnout suggests that \u201cthis anger and disillusionment with the regime as a whole is really not limited to the reformists,\u201d Trita Parsi, a Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, told CNN. \u201cEven amongst conservatives there seems to be a lot of anger and disillusionment with the system, because their participation was very low as well.\u201d Nevertheless, analysts say critical shifts may be taking place among voters ahead of the second round. Some conservatives \u2013 including those who in the first round supported hardliner Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf \u00a0\u2013 appear to be moving their support to the reformist Pezeshkian at the expense of his conservative opponent Jalili. Is the conservative camp fracturing? \u201cYou\u2019ve clearly have had a split amongst the conservatives,\u201d Parsi told CNN, including within the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in which Jalili previously served. Analysts suggest that some conservatives believe it\u2019s necessary to shift away from some of the uncompromising policies of the late President Raisi, which Jalili is likely to continue. One of those conservatives is Sardar Mohsen Rashid, a founder and senior member of the IRGC. Rashid declared his support for Pezeshkian on Monday and called on people to defend him against \u201ccowardly attacks,\u201d according to the conservative Iranian news site Khabar Online. In a move that shocked observers, the man who led Ghalibaf\u2019s electoral campaign, Sami Nazari Tarkarani, also declared his support for reformist Pezeshkian, Khabar Online reported. While it is unclear whether that shift while be reflected on the ground, other supporters of Ghalibaf said they are trying to sway conservatives and silent voters to\u00a0also back the reformist candidate instead. The splits among conservatives also show that sentiments within camps are not homogenous, analysts said. \u201cThe type of anti-establishment sentiments are not limited to just the reformists, you also have it in the ranks of the IRGC,\u201d Parsi said, adding that the current rifts are particularly notable given efforts by the regime to concentrate power only in the hands of the conservatives. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, said that Iranian politics is factional and divided, adding that \u201cnot everyone in the IRGC supports or favors conservative or hardline politics.\u201d What would a win for Pezeshkian mean? In a presidential debate on Monday, both candidates appeared intent on garnering votes from the 60% of the electorate that did not participate, experts said. \u201cPezeshkian is adopting more radical rhetoric to attract nonvoters,\u201d Sina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC, wrote on X. \u201cMeanwhile, Jalili is trying to soften his image, and has agreed with Pezeshkian numerous times.\u201d Pezeshkian, who comes from an Azeri-Kurdish family, has tried to appeal to minorities, women and the country\u2019s youth, Toossi wrote. The establishment appoints people from its \u201cown circles and excludes the rest of the population,\u201d the candidate said during the debate on Monday. Pezeshkian had famously criticized the regime\u2019s handling of the 2022 mass protests, saying that in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d Addressing poverty in Iran, he said during the debate that \u201cthe problem of the poor is us,\u201d adding that if candidates want to increase voter turnout, \u201cthey (the voters) must believe that officials sit at the same table as they do.\u201d Millions in Iran are under the poverty line, often struggling to make ends meet in an economy that has for years been crippled by US sanctions. Iran\u2019s annual inflation rate hasn\u2019t dipped below 30% in over five years, and in June stood at 36.1%, straining wallets across the country. This persistent inflation follows the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement and the subsequent reimposition of heavy sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian stressed the need to re-start dialogue with the West and find a way to end the sanctions. Iran\u2019s relationship with the West has only worsened in recent months, with Tehran supporting militant groups across the Middle East that have targeted both Israeli and US interests amid the war in Gaza. The Islamic Republic has also escalated its nuclear program, pulling back cooperation with the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. What would a Jalili win mean? During the presidential debates, Jalili also sought to appeal to women and youth, saying that voices of students and young Iranians \u201cmust be heard.\u201d However, he stuck to his position that Iran should not rely on the West to ensure progress, a line echoed by the Supreme Leader in recent weeks. \u201cWe must make the enemy regret imposing sanctions,\u201d Jalili said, adding that Western threats must be turned into an opportunity, a line echoed by late President Raisi, who sought to solidify friendships with US foes\u00a0amid Western isolation. The candidates\u2019 opposing views come as rhetoric between Iran and Israel sharpens. The two countries exchanged direct fire for the first time in April as the Gaza conflict widened, and Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Iran\u2019s mission to the UN said on Saturday that should Israel \u201cembark on full-scale military aggression\u201d against Lebanon, then \u201can obliterating war will ensue.\u201d \u201cAll options, including the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table,\u201d it said on X. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded on Saturday, saying that \u201ca regime that threatens destruction deserves to be destroyed.\u201d How much autonomy would either candidate really have? The heated regional tensions raise questions about whether a reformist president can truly make a difference. Experts say it may not be as big of a chance as some in the West might hope. The Supreme Leader is the final arbiter on most decisions in Iran. But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that the president and his foreign policy team are irrelevant,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said. The president and his cabinet implement foreign policy, and have a lot of influence on the diplomatic apparatus of the country, Vaez told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson in an interview on Monday. He noted that Pezeshkian\u2019s presidency would be very different from Jalili\u2019s as the reformist is surrounded by the \u201ccreme de la creme of Iranian diplomats.\u201d Iran\u2019s track record, however, shows that it has tended to take a more conservative trajectory in the long run, even when there has been a reformist president in place, experts said, adding that Tehran\u2019s regional policy toward Israel and its proxies is unlikely to change. When it comes to core policies in Iran, such as support for Hezbollah and animosity toward Israel, a reformist president is unlikely to make a difference, Parsi said, adding that there may however be better engagement with the West. Despite that, Jalili may bring more hardline policies to the table, and potentially double down on his predecessor\u2019s approach. Depending on the environment in the West, Jalili may take a \u201cmuch more confrontational approach to Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d Vakil said, adding that despite the limitations on the president\u2019s freedom to act, each brings their \u201cown personal touch\u201d to Iran\u2019s government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/middleeast/iran-presidential-election-round-two-pezeshkian-jalili-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up.

The plane has the capacity to hold up to 339 passengers, according to Air Europa\u2019s website. One of the passengers, Evangelina Saravia, told the Uruguayan news outlet Teledoce that there had been about 20 minutes of mild turbulence before the plane suddenly dropped 400 meters at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour \u2013 catching some passengers, who had ignored the seatbelt warnings, off guard. \u201c(Before the drop) there were people walking, people without belts. There were children sleeping without belts,\u201d Saravia said. \u201cPeople were thrown from the seats and hit the ceiling, that\u2019s why the ceiling broke,\u201d she added. Another passenger, Daniel Monta\u00f1ez, told CNN he and his wife had been sleeping with their seat belts on when the turbulence hit and awoke to see some of their fellow passengers hitting the ceiling of the cabin and falling back down. \u201cPeople who did not have their seat belts unfortunately suffered consequences, injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were people broken, people on the floor, people screaming, people who felt bad, people bleeding \u2026 A rather chaotic image. As you can imagine, the nerves at that point start to play after you come to your senses about what happened, because at that moment you don\u2019t really notice anything, only movements and madness.\u201d Another passenger, Stevan, told Reuters: \u201cThere are passengers with fractures and injuries to their arms, faces, and legs. There are about 30 people injured. It was a pretty horrible feeling; we thought we were going to die there, but thank God it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The Spanish airline said that another plane was set to depart later on Monday from Madrid and pick up the passengers stranded in Brazil to continue their journey to Uruguay. Air Europa those passengers in need of healthcare were treated in Brazil\u2019s Natal International Airport. A second Air Europe flight picked up some of those diverted to Brazil and took them to Montevideo, Uruguay, their original destination, according to an Air Europa post on X. The passengers arrived in Montevideo on Tuesday morning at 07:20 a.m. local time, according to Air Europa. The airline added in a post on X that they \u201cregret what happened and the inconvenienced caused.\u201d Air Europa also said that some personnel have traveled to Natal to support the passengers that continue to receive medical assistance. The news comes as the latest development in a string of bad publicity for the airplane manufacturer Boeing. While there\u2019s no evidence so far that the injuries on the Air Europa flight had anything to do with a safety malfunction, Boeing has recently faced a series of whistleblowers alleging safety issues at the company. Just last week,\u00a0a whistleblower came forward alleging parts\u00a0of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes were built in an unsafe manner \u2013 potentially leading to \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, said he found and reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing\u00a0halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners\u00a0while it looked into the gaps. Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process and deliveries ultimately resumed. More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since a\u00a0door plug blew off a 737 Max plane\u00a0in January just after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side the plane. The FAA has opened multiple investigations into Boeing and the US Department of Justice said it\u00a0may file criminal charges\u00a0against the company because of its ongoing quality and safety failures.

{"id": "2024_07_02_europe_viktor-orban-visits-kyiv-intl", "text": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor\u00a0Orban has made his first visit to Kyiv since Russia\u2019s full-scale war began, and urged Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider a \u201cceasefire\u201d in order to \u201cspeed up peace talks\u201d with Moscow. Standing alongside Zelensky on Tuesday, Orban, who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has criticized European support for Ukraine, said: \u201cI asked the president to think about whether we could reverse the order, and speed up peace talks, with making a ceasefire first.\u201d Orban continued: \u201cA ceasefire connected to a deadline would give a chance to speed up peace talks. I explored this possibility with the president and I am grateful for his honest answers and negotiation.\u201d The Hungarian leader has touted the idea of ending the war with\u00a0a ceasefire as opposed to military support for Ukraine numerous times since Russia\u2019s military flooded across the border in 2022. Zelensky dismissed the idea, according to his office. Speaking on national TV on Monday, Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of Zelensky\u2019s office, said that even though Orban \u201cwas given the opportunity to express his thoughts\u201d during his visit to Kyiv, Zelensky\u2019s position on this issue \u201cis clear, understandable and known.\u201d Zelensky previously rejected French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Olympic ceasefire proposal citing its potential to inadvertently benefit Russians on the ground. According to Zhovkva, Kyiv\u2019s number one tool to end hostilities is through a second peace summit, which Ukraine is already preparing for. \u201cWe are saying that Ukraine will draft its peace plan, a roadmap for establishing peace in Ukraine. It will develop it with all the states that are ready. Hungary is also ready for this. And then, if the aggressor country is ready to listen to this plan, ready to talk about this plan, and not to speak the language of ultimatums, then yes, during the second summit, we can say that representatives of the Russian Federation may attend this summit in one way or another,\u201d he said. Orban also stated his desire to improve relations between Budapest and Kyiv, which have been strained by the Hungarian leader\u2019s close relationship with Putin. \u201cWe would like to make the relationship between the two countries better,\u201d Orban said. \u201cWe would like to make a broad bilateral agreement with Ukraine, similar to the ones we already made with our neighbors (in the past). We would be happy to take part in the modernization of Ukraine\u2019s economy, we would like an ordered framework for this.\u201d The authoritarian Hungarian leader has regularly attempted to block European Union initiatives offering further military and financial support to Kyiv during the conflict. The Hungarian prime minister\u2019s close relationship with Putin has frequently come under scrutiny. Their bond is underpinned by both economic cooperation and some shared values. Both leaders have also enacted anti-LGBTQ policies and clamped down on freedom of speech in their countries. Hungary has supported Russia at a United Nations level and rejected EU sanctions following Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine as early as 2014, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea. Tuesday\u2019s meeting comes as Orban and Hungary take control of the EU Council\u2019s rotating presidency, which changes every six months. During each six-month period, the country controlling the presidency does not take control of the EU\u2019s overall agenda, but does have a platform through which they can hammer home their own priorities. On the EU Council\u2019s website, it likens holding the presidency \u201cto someone hosting a dinner, making sure their guests all gather in harmony,\u201d adding that to \u201cguarantee effectiveness, the presidency acts as an \u2018honest broker,\u2019 rising above the holder\u2019s own national interest.\u201d Orban took control of the presidency on Monday with a call to \u201cMake Europe Great Again,\u201d a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s political slogan that will alarm many of his European counterparts who are braced for the former US president\u2019s potential return to the White House, concerned about what it will mean for the EU. Other key European diplomatic meetings are planned for July. NATO will celebrate 75 years of the alliance in Washington, DC between July 9 and 11. The agenda for that event is expected to be dominated by long-term plans to support Ukraine and conversations about its eventual accession to the alliance. The European Political Community (EPC), a forum for 47 European countries, inside and outside the EU, to discuss the continent\u2019s strategic challenges, will also meet on July 18 in the United Kingdom. Ukraine and Hungary are both members of the EPC. It is expected that Ukraine will dominate that agenda and Zelensky may attend the meeting in person. Orban may have had this in mind when timing this trip to Kyiv, ensuring that his first meeting with Ukraine\u2019s president since the start of the war was not in such a public and high-stakes diplomatic setting.

{"id": "2024_07_02_style_kinds-of-kindness-costumes", "text": "Yorgos Lanthimos \u2014 the movie director behind award season darlings \u201cThe Favourite\u201d and \u201cPoor Things\u201d \u2014 is hailed as a genius by fans of his often strange and unsettling oeuvre. He\u2019s made his name by courting the absurd and keeping audiences on their toes, embellishing his fables of love, power and free will with discordant musical motifs and disarming cuts to a wide lens. His latest project, \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d traces recognizable power dynamics \u2014 those with your boss, with your spouse or even with religious leaders \u2014 onto a surreal universe where they are intensified to their greatest (and often bloodiest) extremes. The film is told in three short stories. In the first, \u201cThe Death of R.M.F.,\u201d Jesse Plemons plays Robert, the hapless puppet of his boss Raymond (Willem Dafoe). In the second tale, \u201cR.M.F. is Flying,\u201d Plemons is a police officer whose wife (Emma Stone) has gone missing on a diving trip. When she returns, she seems fundamentally changed, prompting Plemons to test her love for him in progressively revolting ways. In the third instalment, \u201cR.M.F. Eats a Sandwich,\u201d Stone and a now-shaven headed Plemons are the disciples of a purity cult led by Dafoe, tasked with locating someone able to revive the dead. Although apparently detached from one another \u2014 bar the rotating cast and transient presence of the mysterious R.M.F. character (played by Yorgos Stefanakos) \u2014 each entry into the anthology repeats Lanthimos\u2019 career-spanning thesis: human agency is a myth, and people will commit unhinged acts to be accepted by the powerful. Happily, that dark existentialism didn\u2019t cloud the mood on set. \u201c(Lanthimos) puts together a group of really like-minded, lovely people that he feels will get along,\u201d Jennifer Johnson, the film\u2019s costume designer, told CNN via video call. \u201cWorking with Yorgos in general is a very satisfying, exhilarating and scary place, all at the same time. It\u2019s really fun!\u201d Power dressing \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is a film imbued with symbolism, and the costumes were critical in defining characters\u2019 relative status; in the first relationship we meet, Robert (Plemons) and Raymond (Dafoe) each wear their power quite literally on their sleeves. Raymond, dressed expensively in Italian suits, is \u201csomebody who has a lot of money, and exudes power and style but does it in his own way,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s this sense of confidence that was really important to telegraph very quickly, and this subtly eccentric way of dressing.\u201d His looks took inspiration from Gianni Agnelli, the head of Fiat between 1966 and 1996, who was a champion of Italy\u2019s nonchalantly chic \u201cSprezzatura\u201d style. \u201cHe would take hiking boots and wear them with a custom suit, with his watch worn on the outside of his shirt,\u201d Johnson recalled of Agnelli. \u201cIt\u2019s this mixing and matching that we take for granted now, but when (Agnelli) was dressing that was something that was very unusual.\u201d Per Raymond\u2019s written instructions \u2014 detailing not only how Robert should dress, but what he should read (always Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d); what he should eat, and when he should have sex with his wife \u2014 Plemons is also immaculately suited, if self-consciously so. \u201c(Raymond) gives him things that would make most men really uncomfortable,\u201d Johnson said, pointing to a pink Tom Ford turtleneck Robert\u2019s made to wear. \u201cIt\u2019s (one of) the little signifiers of eccentric power play.\u201d Three stories, three looks Having crafted a visual language to reflect one power dynamic, the film\u2019s structure meant the same also had to be done for the second and third chapters. \u201cEach story plays for about an hour, so there\u2019s definitely enough character development within each one that it is a full movie. That was very difficult in our short production time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWillem is such a great example: you are a CEO, and then you\u2019re (Stone\u2019s) father, and now you\u2019re a leader of a sex cult. To traverse that territory and walk all those distances in one (costume) fitting was a challenge, for sure.\u201d Most of the cast shoulder three characters each but, in the final chapter, Margaret Qualley had the additional task of playing identical twins Rebecca and Ruth. For Johnson, this required carving out clear character traits. \u201cWhat was nice is that one twin was really wild and had a punk rock spirit; you can imagine she\u2019s into indie music and is not really walking to a mainstream beat, whereas her twin sister is a veterinarian who is kind of bookish,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was important (the veterinarian) wore comfort shoes, so they were her Dansko clogs, and that she would have a darned sock; something that feels homemade. She likes pretty things, but she\u2019s not interested in fashion. You make these rules for each person.\u201d Dressing for laughs Despite the film\u2019s grim subject matter, there are unexpectedly comedic moments \u2014 not so much to offer respite but, if anything, to add to the jarring effect. Several of them rely on costuming to provide the visual gag \u2014 with Dafoe leading the charge. As Raymond, he stands up from the sofa after lambasting Robert to reveal a pair of exposed knees to the camera; a switch in tone sharp enough to pull roars of laughter from the audience in the movie theater. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of men in the world who can wear a knee-high sock and a white pleated short and look really gorgeous at the same time!\u201d Johnson joked. In the third chapter Dafoe plays a cult leader, freed from Raymond\u2019s designer suits and instead sporting little else besides eyeliner and orange Speedos. \u201cWillem is just one of the most lovely, delightful and intelligent collaborators you could ever ask for,\u201d Johnson beamed. \u201cHis physicality is so beautiful and lends itself to wearing clothing so well, so he can really go for it and wear the most absurd thing \u2014 but it\u2019s not wearing him; he\u2019s wearing it.\u201d The brightly-colored swimwear \u2014 a reflection of the cult\u2019s affinity for water \u2014 was a surprise pick for Dafoe, who made a beeline for it in the fitting room. \u201cBecause the cult is very sexual, I thought it would be great if we could get him in the least amount of clothes possible,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was the first thing that he saw and he said \u2018yup, I\u2019m putting that on!\u2019. It was a very fun moment because we didn\u2019t tell Yorgos about it. (Dafoe) walked out for the camera test in it, and it definitely got a laugh!\u201d On their hunt for the elusive \u201cwaker of the dead,\u201d Stone and Plemons\u2019 outfits \u2014 earth-tone, loosely-fitted suits paired with sandals \u2014 are also laughably conspicuous. Johnson drew reference to \u201cThe X Files,\u201d but Ken and Barbie trying to blend in on Venice Beach also springs to mind. \u201cThey\u2019re like detectives, and they\u2019re cult members but they have to pretend to be normal,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201cI think those characters thought \u2018oh, well a suit makes us look normal,\u2019 when in actuality they look really weird and more scary; they would have been better off in their cult wear, which was just outdoor gear.\u201d Plemons\u2019 suit was one of two found in a gargantuan thrift store \u2014 \u201clike a whole city unto itself\u201d \u2014 in New Orleans, where the film was shot. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun when you find that; you can just imagine the gentleman who donated it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt came in dark brown and tan, but the dark brown one never made it onto the camera.\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is an oddly-dressed, oddly-paced detour from a traditional blockbuster, but it does make a compelling argument for the collective, visceral experience of cinema. Over the course of an almost three-hour screening, Lanthimos\u2019 efforts provoked audible gasps, averted eyes and strangled groans. There was laughter: full-bodied at times, faltering at others, as viewers grappled with whether they were being entertained or horrified in real time. People recoiled. One person cried. As the credits rolled, a stunned silence fell over the room. The atmosphere had taken on its own heightened reality; complementary to Lanthimos\u2019 style, difficult to stop thinking about on the way home.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/style/kinds-of-kindness-costumes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_termessos-turkey-hidden-ancient-mountaintop-city", "text": "Alexander the Great tried to conquer Termessos but failed. Today, the incredible deserted ruins of this once-powerful city, perched like a fortified eagle\u2019s nest high in the mountains of southwestern Turkey, can be conquered by anyone willing to make the hike up here. But few people ever do. Termessos stands empty. A spectacular archeological jewel, preserved in isolation, seen only by a few handfuls of people who make the trip from the beach resorts of nearby tourism hot spot Antalya. That\u2019s a shame for those who miss out. For those who do get to explore, it\u2019s a major bonus. They get to wander around one of Turkey\u2019s most impressive ancient cities all by themselves. It\u2019s a place of incredible atmosphere: history and landscape; views and silence; nature and destruction \u2013 all combining to create one of the Mediterranean\u2019s great unsung archaeological wonders. Here, slowly being swallowed by vegetation and worn down by time, are gigantic mausoleums, vast underground cisterns, temples, imposing city walls and a breathtaking theater perched, like Machu Picchu, on a hilltop that offers views stretching for miles all around. Despite its emptiness, Termessos is easy to reach. It only takes around 45 minutes to drive from Antalya\u2019s traffic-snarled downtown to the gates of Mount G\u00fcll\u00fck-Termessos National Park \u2013 a protected wildlife haven that surrounds the ruins. After paying a three-euro (about $3) gate fee at the park\u2019s entrance, visitors then face another 10-minute ride further into the pine and gorse-clad hills along a switchback road that reaches about 1,000 meters above sea level. Eventually the road emerges into what seems like an uninteresting parking lot with a public restroom. This was, in fact, at one time a giant agora, or marketplace for the city, which in its heyday 2,000 years ago would\u2019ve been bustling with traders and citizens. It\u2019s here where the Termessos adventure begins. And it begins with death. Tomb raiders Hidden by vegetation at one end of the agora are the stone-strewn remains of what was clearly once a grand street leading away along the hillside. Instead of houses or shops, this was lined with the tombs of Termessos\u2019 rich and mighty. Ancient sarcophagi carved with clues to who they once contained, like shields and spears for warriors, lie scattered. Some are small, others huge \u2013 offering clues to levels of wealth or power. Some are unfinished, their huge pedestals hinting at what would\u2019ve been. All of them have been broken into by raiders over the centuries, their walls smashed or lids prised off despite once being locked shut with metal clasps. Tree roots and ivy creepers have also snaked through the stonework. \u201cThe thieves working here were very good at their jobs,\u201d says \u00d6nder U\u011fuz, an Antalya-based art teacher and licensed guide who offers tours of Termessos, which he\u2019s been captivated by since first coming here as a student in 1996 (\u201cIt was love at first sight!\u201d). Reaching the heart of the ancient city involves an uphill hike along a leafy pathway that\u2019s a little rough and steep in places. Visitors here need to be equipped with sturdy footwear and OK with mildly strenuous hiking on tricky terrain. In summer, it\u2019s best to visit early before temperatures start to climb, and bring water. Soon the lower city walls loom into view \u2013 a first hint at how well-defended Termessos was when it was built perhaps around the fourth or fifth century BCE, long before the Romans showed up with the engineering skills that would transform the known world. Which raises the question: how did the people of Termessos do it? U\u011fuz laughs off the suggestion of any mystery here. We\u2019re too caught up in the achievements of our technological age to appreciate even the basic abilities of our distant ancestors, in his opinion. \u201cYou and I, we\u2019re nothing without our computers and social media accounts,\u201d he says (shortly after taking a snap for his own Instagram feed). \u201cTake those away and we are helpless. Not these people. They worked with stone for centuries. They had nothing else. Building things like this was what they knew how to do.\u201d The people of Termessos were known as Solyms, descendants of Luwians, an ancient civilization that was spread across what is now Turkey, but largely overlooked by archaeological scholars until the past few decades. To this day, little is known about the Solyms or when they constructed their city. But they clearly knew what they were doing. Their choice of location showed a genius for strategic thinking. Not only was it on a major trade route, enabling it to grow wealthy on goods and payments from people heading to and from the Mediterranean, its altitude and commanding views made it easy to defend. Which is why when Alexander the Great showed up around 333 BCE \u2013 when Termessos made its first real appearance in the history books \u2013 he was apparently unable to invade or blockade the city into surrender, despite multiple attempts. He reputedly called the city an \u201ceagle\u2019s nest.\u201d Later, the Romans had more success in controlling the city. Not through force, says U\u011fuz, but through more insidious means, like offering autonomy under Roman \u201cprotection.\u201d \u201cThe Romans were like the mafia,\u201d he suggests. Fight school Climbing higher up the hillside on a rocky path sprouting with fragrant wild sage, there\u2019s more evidence of how sophisticated life in Termessos would\u2019ve been. To the left, there\u2019s the marble ruins of the city\u2019s gymnasium, a kind of college campus for trainee soldiers, complete with bathhouse and refectory. Some of the main building is still intact, with indications that impressive arches once ran across its front wall. Inside were two floors, plus a subterranean vault for storage. In front is the palaestra, an area that would\u2019ve been used for wrestling and combat training and which today is littered with pieces of the gymnasium\u2019s terracotta roof tiles. It is, of course, mostly derelict. Termessos was believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake the exact date of which is not known, but possibly the 4th or 5th century. What remains is not the work of archeological reconstruction. It\u2019s the genuine state the building has been left in for the past 1,600 years. Here, the silence and emptiness of the place allow the imagination to wander \u2013 bringing those warriors back to life and allowing visualization of their mock battles in a place that has changed so little over time. Further up, the upper city walls give commanding views of the forest below and offer a good vantage point over anyone trying to sneak up for an invasion. Beyond them is more evidence of civilization. There are the remains of a covered water drainage system. And for a city that had few water sources, they are one of its most impressive assets \u2013 gigantic multi-chambered underground cisterns carved by hand into solid rock and lined with plaster. Capable of holding up to 1,500 tons of water, these cavernous containers would\u2019ve been vital to the survival of a city that had few natural sources of H2O \u2013 especially when Alexander the Great was mounting blockades. Today, they\u2019re filled with broken columns and other rubble, likely dumped there when the city was abandoned. There\u2019s speculation water shortages could\u2019ve been behind a decision to finally relocate the city elsewhere. Luxury shops Nearby, there\u2019s the imposing outer wall of the bouleuterion or assembly house that would\u2019ve been the city\u2019s seat of power, another central agora dating back to pre-Roman times and the ruins of a colonnaded street that once housed the city\u2019s most exclusive shops. \u201cThis is the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Termessos,\u201d says U\u011fuz. Like the Parisian upscale retail boulevard, this would\u2019ve been where the wealthy spent their cash, he explains. The finest olive oils, cloths, leather goods and items imported from all around the Mediterranean would\u2019ve been on sale here. These are all sideshows to the city\u2019s showstopper attraction: the theater After a last scramble over huge slabs of marble, the view opens up onto an epic panorama of the large performance space, perched on the city\u2019s highest point. The setting is breathtaking, with mountain ravines cascading away on either side. The sheer drop behind the theater\u2019s upper walls is dizzying. It\u2019s a reminder to be careful when exploring ruins that haven\u2019t been fenced off for safety. With room for about 4,000 people, the semi-circle of stone terraces faces the ruins of what would\u2019ve been a stage. The theater probably predated the arrival of the Romans, but was later updated along Roman lines. In Termessos, the location is particularly significant, as it sits opposite a mountain that was once sacred to the city\u2019s inhabitants. It\u2019s easy to see why this was such a hallowed spot, with views that, on haze-free days, stretch as far as the port of Antalya. And again, it\u2019s a place to sit and imagine what life was like nearly 2,000 years ago, when such theaters would\u2019ve been used by the Romans as, according to U\u011fuz, a propaganda tool - a soft force to keep their empire in check. As history lessons go, this is pretty spectacular. U\u011fuz (who can be contacted via email: onder.uguz@gmail.com) says he never tires of exploring Termessos. He also offers tours of other more popular archaeological sites in the area, but the tranquility and beauty of this hidden ancient wonder draw him back time and again. He particularly loves soaking in the vistas from the city\u2019s upper walls. \u201cUsually, I\u2019m sitting there with my wife, under a juniper tree in springtime, a beautiful blue sky with this great scenery,\u201d he says, adding that year-round, the solitude offered by Termessos is also an attraction. \u201cFor me it\u2019s perfect. Just you and nature; little squirrels and archaeology. The only thing missing is a cold beer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/termessos-turkey-hidden-ancient-mountaintop-city/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_29_europe_france-parliament-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "France has seen the highest turnout in decades as voting in the first round of snap parliamentary elections neared the end. The election could oust President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance and leave him to see out the remaining three years of his term in an awkward partnership with the far right. Estimates published by Ipsos polling say the total voter turnout on Sunday is expected to be 65.5%, the highest France has seen in a first round of parliamentary elections since 1997. The estimates marks an 18 point increase compared to 2022. Voting began at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), as France started the process of electing the 577 members of its National Assembly through locally fought contests across the country and in its overseas territories. The election is being held three years earlier than it needed to be, and three weeks after Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right National Rally (RN), the party of Marine Le Pen, in the European Parliament elections. Minutes after the humiliating defeat, in an apparent attempt to call voters\u2019 bluff, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent by voters and took the \u201cserious, heavy\u201d decision to call a snap election \u2013 France\u2019s first since 1997. Whatever the outcome, Macron has pledged to remain in post until France\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. The National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws \u2013 from pensions and taxation to immigration and education \u2013 while the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party, things run well. When they don\u2019t, the government can grind to a halt \u2013 a prospect that could haunt Paris as it prepares to host the summer Olympics next month. France most recently had such a government \u2013 known as \u201ccohabitation\u201d - when right-wing President Jacques Chirac called snap polls and was forced to appoint a socialist, Lionel Jospin, as prime minister, who stayed in the post for five years. The first round of votes eliminates weaker candidates ahead of the second round next Sunday. If a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. Typically, only a handful of deputies will be elected this way \u2013 but most will go to a second round. Only those who win more than 12.5% of ballots cast by registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round. Often this is fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. Some candidates choose to drop out at this stage to give their allies a better chance of victory. Most voters will choose one of three blocs: the RN-led far-right alliance; the New Popular Front (NFP), a recently formed left-wing coalition; and Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble. The RN bloc is headed by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party leader handpicked by Le Pen, who has striven to polish the image of a party historically ridden with racism and antisemitism that proliferated under the decades-long leadership of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Until recently, the prospect of a far-right government was unthinkable. In the past, opposition parties have made marriages of convenience in an attempt to block the RN \u2013 under its previous name, the National Front \u2013 from entering government. Now, within a couple of weeks, Bardella could become France\u2019s prime minister \u2013 and Europe\u2019s youngest in more than two centuries. On the left, a previously fractious cluster of parties have recently banded together to form the New Popular Front \u2013 a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that prevented fascists from gaining power in 1936. The broad alliance comprises more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique\u2019s Raphael Glucksmann. Meanwhile, outgoing French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal \u2013 who was only appointed to his post by Macron in January \u2013 is representing Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance. Attal was reportedly among the last of Macron\u2019s inner circle to learn that a snap election was imminent. Polls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story miscalculated the time polls open in the election.

{"id": "2024_07_04_travel_paris-chefs-immigrants-national-rally", "text": "Located on the famous Rue Bretagne \u2013 known as one of the best bar streets in Paris \u2013 the terrace of Le Pinardier is always busy on summer evenings.  It\u2019s a quintessentially French experience - regulars ordering the wines of the day alongside cheese and charcuterie - but one only made possible by one of the most divisive issues in the country right now: immigration. At Le Pinardier, those food orders from the sunny terrace quickly end up 70 feet away, in the kitchen, in the hands of 24-year-old chef, Sazal Saha. Originally from the city of Kuhlna in Bangladesh, Saha is in his fifth year at Le Pinardier after training in catering for two years at the Joliet-Curie School in northern France. He\u2019s typically the only person working in the kitchen, which means he does everything: buying the produce, preparing ingredients, cooking, washing the dishes and cleaning. \u201cManaging the kitchen is not easy when you\u2019re working alone,\u201d Saha told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated, sometimes I get tired, but I\u2019m used to it,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cWhen I first moved to France, I didn\u2019t know anything about cheese, but I know almost everything about them now,\u201d he said. One key reason behind Saha\u2019s decision to become a cook in the French capital is because he saw the huge demand from the industry. A job French people don\u2019t want? Across France and especially in Paris, hospitality is one of the industries that is most heavily reliant on immigrant workers. Roughly 25% of the cooks in France are immigrants from outside of the European Union, the then French Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt told Europe 1 radio at the beginning of 2024. Half of the 86,000-plus chefs in the French capital are immigrants, according to data published by the French National Institute of Statistic and Economic Studies in 2022. They\u2019re the main force supporting the gastronomic landscape of the French capital, feeding and delighting tourists from across the globe. \u201cMost of the people working in kitchens [in Paris] are either from Bangladesh or Sri Lanka,\u201d said Florian Mousson, owner of Le Pinardier. Born and raised in a family of generations of restaurant owners in the southern city of Marseille, Mousson believes that his business would not survive without immigrant workers. Yet, in this month\u2019s French parliamentary elections, which enters a second round vote this weekend, anti-immigration sentiment is seen as one of the factors driving the popularity of far-right party Rassemblement National (National Rally). In Paris, kitchen workers are mostly originally from South Asia, like Saha. In Mousson\u2019s hometown Marseille and many places in the south of France, restaurants and bars rely on immigrants from the Comoros, a former French colony in the Indian Ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough job. You work standing up, you work evenings and weekends, you put in long hours, and it\u2019s very hot in the kitchen. Often in Paris, the kitchens are very small, so it\u2019s a very strenuous job,\u201d Mousson said. \u201cThere are fewer and fewer French people who are willing to do this job,\u201d he added. He hired Saha shortly after he opened Le Pinardier in 2019, making contact through a website called Leboncoin, the French version of Craigslist. Mousson says that he\u2019s not only a good cook, but a tough worker and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 a team player. Some might argue that restaurant owners prefer to hire immigrants because they cost less, but for Mousson that is not the case. \u201cI don\u2019t care if my cook is French or a foreigner. But when you put out an ad looking for a chef, for every eight or nine foreign CVs you receive, you get one French CV, so even statistically speaking you\u2019re more likely to hire a foreigner,\u201d he said. Saha earns a good salary due to the long hours he has to work. Mousson says that it\u2019s not low salaries that dictate who works in the kitchen; it\u2019s whether the person has the sticking power for such a demanding position. Mousson\u2019s first chef was French. But she resigned after only three days because she wanted a job where she can solely focus on cooking and not do the rest of the job \u2013 cleaning the kitchen, cleaning dishes and all the rest. \u201cFor a small business like us, we cannot afford to hire multiple people in the kitchen,\u201d Mousson said. \u2018I\u2019m a little worried\u2019 Saha likes Paris. Over the past five years, cooking for Parisians and tourists has allowed him to buy an apartment in a suburb and make a living in the French capital. But now the looming possibility of the far right coming to power is keeping him up at night. \u201cI am a little worried. I believe their decision is not correct,\u201d he said, referring to the immigration policies and rhetoric he saw on TV the weekend before. National Rally won a record 33.15% of the vote, leading the race following the first round of French parliamentary elections on June 30, according to data published by the French Interior Ministry. While it remains to be seen if the party can capture an absolute majority in the French National Assembly, it will almost certainly become the biggest force in the new parliament. Running on a \u201cFrance first\u201d agenda, National Rally is calling for much stricter control on immigration, both legal and illegal. It also wants to give French citizens preferential treatment in the social welfare system. \u201cWe are here, we are not doing bad things, we are working here, we are paying taxes, we are paying everything like all French people,\u201d Saha said. \u201cWhy are they making decisions that are so hard on immigration? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d But this doesn\u2019t stop him from looking forwards to his future life in France, a country that he loves. \u201cI am proud to work in a French restaurant. I like it. I love it,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/travel/paris-chefs-immigrants-national-rally/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_style_anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-preview-intl-hnk", "text": "Billionaire heir Anant Ambani is set to marry his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant later this month, in a lavish ceremony widely described as the country\u2019s wedding of the year. Extravagant pre-wedding celebrations have already sent Indian media into a frenzy and social media feeds are abuzz over what\u2019s to come. In March, the couple had a three-day pre-wedding party in the western city of Jamnagar, attended by around 1,200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. An elaborate light show featuring 5,500 drones lit up the sky above a glass palace custom-built for the festivities where partygoers danced the night away to a performance by none other than Rihanna. Then, over a weekend in late May, the couple held a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, which made multiple stops through Europe, and included a bevy of Bollywood A-listers, with performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and opera star Andrea Bocelli. The Mumbai wedding is set to take place July 12 to 14 at the home of Anant\u2019s parents Mukesh and Nita Ambani \u2013 a 27-story residence called Antilia \u2013 as well as the family-owned Jio World Convention Centre, a sprawling venue with a capacity for more than 16,000 people. Details have been tightly guarded, but if the pre-wedding events are anything to go by, the upcoming nuptials are expected to be grand. Here\u2019s what we know. Who are the bride and groom? Ambani, 29, is the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who has an estimated fortune of $118 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His son is responsible for driving the expansion of the energy sector of the family\u2019s conglomerate, Reliance Industries. The youngest of three siblings, Ambani graduated from Brown University. His brother and sister are on the board of Reliance and manage other parts of the company. Anant has been concerned about animal welfare since childhood. He recently launched his passion project, Vantara, a 3,000-acre animal shelter, which was toured by VIP guests dressed in jungle-themed attire during the pre-wedding party in Jamnagar. Merchant, 29, is the daughter of pharma tycoon Viren Merchant, and works for his company, Encore Healthcare. A graduate of New York University, she told Vogue that she met Ambani through mutual friends during a drive in 2017. \u201cThat first meeting just sparked something special between us, and it wasn\u2019t long before we started dating,\u201d she said.  Merchant is also formally trained in Bharatnatyam, a form of Indian classical dance. Speaking of his wife to-be, Ambani said during a speech in Jamnagar: \u201cI am 100% the lucky one. It feels like I met Radhika yesterday, but every day, I fall more and more in love.\u201d What can we expect at the wedding? In keeping with Hindu tradition, the couple\u2019s wedding dates were reportedly chosen according to auspicious days on their birth charts. Hindu weddings typically include several events and take place over more than one day. The festivities usually include a haldi ceremony, where guests apply turmeric paste on the bride and groom\u2019s arms and face for good luck and protection from evil spirits. Then there\u2019s the mehndi, a ritual where an artist paints intricate henna patterns on to the hands of the bride and guests. The night before the wedding is usually reserved for the sangeet, when the bride and groom\u2019s wedding party dances for guests. According to a leaked wedding invitation posted by ANI, one of India\u2019s largest news agencies, festivities will kick off on July 12 with the \u201cShubh Vivaah\u201d or \u201causpicious wedding\u201d ceremony. The following day is the \u201cShubh Aashirwad\u201d or \u201cdivine blessing\u201d ceremony, and festivities conclude on July 14 with the \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d or reception. The invitation was placed in an ornate red box with a depiction of the Hindu god Vishnu on its front, according to a video published by ANI. Manish Malhotra, one of the country\u2019s most famous designers, has been appointed as the wedding\u2019s creative director, collaborating with Nita Ambani and numerous vendors to execute the family\u2019s vision. Malhotra told CNN that he built on Nita\u2019s \u201cvisionary approach,\u201d with his team creating themes and experiences for the wedding that \u201cembody the essence of India while reflecting the couple\u2019s distinct personalities.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he explained via e-mail. What can we expect from the wedding fashion? The bride and groom are expected to wear statement-making attire showcasing Indian craft and textiles, homegrown talent as well as pieces imbued with symbolism. The couple\u2019s outfits worn in the pre-wedding events included striking pieces from top Indian designers, such as Malhotra, Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Tarun Tahiliani. Malhotra designed two lehengas that Merchant wore to the pre-wedding bash. The golden garment was studded with 20,000 Swarovski crystals and employed the knowledge of over 70 artisans while an Art Deco inspired blue lehenga took 5,700 hours to make. Ambani\u2019s looks have also been bold. At one of the events in Jamnagar, he wore an ivory sherwani, a traditional Indian two-piece suit, designed by Rohit Bal, with a custom brooch by Lorraine Schwartz. Luxury\u00a0fashion labels have been seen alongside up-and-coming labels. Merchant wore Versace during the March celebrations \u2014 a custom pink version of the gown previously worn by Blake Lively at the 2022 Met Gala. On the Mediterranean cruise, Merchant wore a black and white gown designed by Hong Kong-born Robert Wun, with a love letter from her fiance printed onto the chiffon skirt. Coordinating with Merchant, Ambani also wore a custom black suit designed by Wun, encrusted with jewels. For the July wedding, Malhotra said his team has \u201cdedicated several months of meticulous craftsmanship to create exquisite pieces.\u201d While he was unable to reveal the details of the garments ahead of the occasion, he said work on some of them began before the pre-wedding celebrations. At the upcoming wedding, guests are expected to dress in \u201ctraditional Indian\u201d attire on Friday, according to the wedding invitation, which could include a saree for women, and a kurta \u2013 loosely fitted pants with a tunic \u2013 for men. Guests have been asked to wear \u201cIndian formal\u201d attire the following day and \u201cIndian chic\u201d for Sunday\u2019s reception event. Malhotra described the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code as something that \u201cmarries traditional Indian elements with contemporary fashion.\u201d For the couple, he said, this translates into \u201cstriking ensembles that honor our rich cultural heritage while reflecting their personal style. Think of intricate embroidery and innovative silhouettes that capture both tradition and modernity.\u201d As for the guests, Malhotra said, we can expect to see \u201ctimeless sarees and lehengas paired with modern blouses, or traditional sherwanis with a contemporary twist. \u201cThe key is to celebrate Indian craftsmanship while embracing a sophisticated, stylish aesthetic that feels both timeless and fresh.\u201d What it takes to pull off a wedding on this scale An event of this magnitude takes months to plan and likely involves hundreds of people working behind the scenes to make it happen. \u201cAny kind of mega project like this usually requires about nine to 12 months of preparation work, and there is the involvement of nearly 40 to 45 big agencies or partners,\u201d Mareesha Parikh, a Mumbai-based wedding planner and founder of Swaaha Weddings, told CNN on a phone call. Separate teams will likely be dealing with reservations, securing entertainment, managing production design, handling logistics, among others tasks on the day, she added. India\u2019s wedding industry has dramatically evolved over the last decade, with Bollywood and celebrity culture inspiring couples to throw grander and even more expensive affairs. But with the intense public fascination with Ambani and Merchant\u2019s wedding, also comes some criticism. To some, the opulence of the event stands in stark contrast to the poverty affecting tens of millions in the country, and points to what critics say is an increasing wealth gap between the rich and poor. The Ambanis, aware of their privilege, have carried out charitable acts before some of the celebrations. On Tuesday, they staged a mass wedding for 50 \u201cunderprivileged\u201d couples in the city, gifting them jewellery as well as household items and groceries for a year. Now valued at\u00a0around $130 billion,\u00a0according to the Confederation of All India Traders,\u00a0the wedding sector is country\u2019s fourth largest industry, employing millions of people. In December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a \u201cwed in India\u201d campaign to keep the money spent on weddings inside the country. \u201cAreas of specialization have also grown,\u201d Parikh said. \u201cTake gift hampers for example. We used to source those and wrap them ourselves. Now there\u2019s a separate agency that does the sourcing and a separate agency that does the packaging.\u201d Vanessa Almeida, the Goa-based owner of The Gift House, who was responsible for packaging some 8,000 gifts for Ambani\u2019s guests in Jamnagar told CNN she was in the city for two weeks to ensure all the preparations were going to plan. \u201cDuring the event, we were asked not to take photos of the event, of the people or of the work that we were doing,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cThey had very respectfully even asked the guests not to do so as they had their own teams capturing everything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/style/anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-preview-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_weather_july-fourth-forecast-extreme-heat-climate", "text": "Grills won\u2019t be the only thing sizzling this Fourth of July as uncomfortable, potentially dangerous heat sets in for millions in the US. This summer started off unusually hot and is largely expected to stay that way, as forecasts show only fleeting moments of respite in the weeks ahead. Summertime heat will be in place for much of the Lower 48 for Independence Day as the US enters its hottest time of the year. But temperatures for two large sections of the country are expected to far exceed those typical of early July. Heat will ramp up in parts of the West and southern US this week, culminating in temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal in California and Oregon on Thursday and 5 to 10 degrees above normal from Texas and Oklahoma to the Carolinas. High temperatures in the 100s and 110s will hit parts of California\u2019s Central Valley while desert areas in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will approach 115 degrees. Sacramento \u2014 which just experienced its fourth-hottest June on record \u2014 could come close to its hottest Fourth of July with a high near 107 degrees Thursday. Las Vegas could come within a couple degrees of its hottest-ever Independence Day when the mercury tops out around 112. Heat has been relentless for the city \u2014 this June was also its hottest on record. While Thursday won\u2019t be record-hot for Phoenix, temperatures in the city are expected to climb around 7 degrees above its normal high of about 107. Thursday is also likely to be the third day in a row where temperatures exceed the 110 degree mark for the city \u2014 a streak that will continue into next week. Thursday will be very hot for parts of the West but even higher temperatures are expected to follow. Brutal heat will expand into much of the Pacific Northwest on Friday and keep temperatures sky-high across California and the desert Southwest. Portland, Oregon, will swelter as temperatures climb into the mid-90s Thursday and soar to near 100 degrees on Friday \u2014 about 25 degrees hotter than normal. The South will also bake Thursday, but it won\u2019t quite reach the extremes the West will endure. High temperatures in the 90s will be widespread in the Southern states, with parts of Texas and Oklahoma set to reach into the low 100s. Dallas will climb to around 101 degrees Thursday, likely marking the fourth day in a row of the thermometer hitting triple digits. Typically, the metro should have a high of around 94 for Independence Day. Farther east, Atlanta should normally top out at around 88 degrees on the Fourth of July, but the city is expected to reach 94 degrees this time around. The heat comes after the city recorded 11 days in a row of temperatures at or above 90 degrees to the end of June and recorded its first 100 degree reading in nearly five years. Humidity will make the heat feel even worse in the South, sending heat index values \u2014 how hot the air actually feels to the body \u2014 over 100 degrees for millions. Dangerous heat index values coupled with outdoor activity for the holiday could result in heat-related illnesses without the proper precautions. In addition to the heat, Mother Nature will also provide her own Fourth of July fireworks. Thunderstorms will rumble over portions of the Mississippi Valley and Midwest from the morning hours onward as a cold front digs southward across the regions. Thunderstorms are also possible from parts of the Ohio Valley to the Northeast. As the day progresses, some severe thunderstorms are possible, mainly in parts of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas during the afternoon and evening. These storms could unload damaging wind gusts, hail, heavy rain and even a tornado or two. Any storms that linger into the evening hours could disrupt fireworks displays. Rain may prevent organizers from launching fireworks and any lightning strikes will make it dangerous for large crowds to be outdoors. Major fireworks shows in Washington, DC, Philadelphia and New York City may have to deal with storms Thursday evening.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/weather/july-fourth-forecast-extreme-heat-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_asia_putin-xi-russia-china-alignment-sco-astana-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday urged regional leaders to resist \u201cexternal interference\u201d at a gathering of a Eurasian security bloc touted by Beijing and Moscow as a counterbalance to Western power. Addressing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)\u2019s annual leaders\u2019 summit in Kazakhstan, Xi called on member states to \u201cconsolidate the power of unity\u201d in the face of \u201cthe real challenge of interference and division.\u201d \u201cWe should work together to resist external interference \u2026 and firmly grasp our own future and destiny, as well as regional peace and development, in our own hands,\u201d Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. The 10-member bloc must handle internal differences with peace, seek common ground, and resolve difficulties in cooperation,\u00a0Xi\u00a0added. Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years as Beijing and Moscow drive a transformation of the bloc from a regional security club with a focus on Central Asia to a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies. On Thursday, Belarus, a staunch Russian ally that helped Moscow launch its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, became the latest authoritarian state to join the SCO, after Iran\u00a0became a full member\u00a0last year. The bloc underwent its first expansion in 2017 to welcome India and Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was notably absent from this year\u2019s event, further adding to the perception of the SCO\u2019s anti-Western orientation. At the summit, Xi warned against what he called \u201cthe real threat of Cold War mentality\u201d and called on member states to \u201cuphold our security baseline.\u201d He also urged countries to safeguard the right to development in the face of the \u201creal risks of small yards with high fences,\u201d referring to a strategy adopted by the US to restrict key technologies from China. The Chinese leader stressed the need to jointly promote scientific and technological innovation, and to maintain the stability and smoothness of industrial and supply chains. China-Russia alignment On the eve of the summit, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 the two leaders driving the SCO\u2019s expansion \u2013 met on the sidelines and hailed their countries\u2019 deepening alignment. In opening remarks ahead of their bilateral meeting, Putin said Russia-China relations are going through \u201cthe best period in their history\u201d and should be considered a \u201cstabilizing\u201d force for the world. \u201cRussian-Chinese cooperation in\u00a0global affairs serves as\u00a0a\u00a0main stabilizing factor on\u00a0the\u00a0international stage, and\u00a0we continue to\u00a0further enhance it,\u201d Putin told Xi on Wednesday. The Russian president also underscored Moscow and Beijing\u2019s roles \u201cat the cradle\u201d of the SCO\u2019s founding and noted its rapid expansion in recent years. \u201cAs\u00a0the\u00a0number of\u00a0participants grew \u2026 the\u00a0SCO also gained a\u00a0bigger role as\u00a0one of\u00a0the\u00a0key pillars of\u00a0a\u00a0just multipolar world order,\u201d Putin said. The meeting\u00a0marks the two leaders\u2019 second face-to-face talks in just two months following\u00a0Putin\u2019s visit to Beijing\u00a0in May and comes shortly after the Russian president struck\u00a0a landmark defense pact\u00a0with North Korea. Much to the consternation of the US and Europe, China and Russia have\u00a0deepened their political, economic and military ties\u00a0since Putin and Xi declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership in February 2022 when the Russian leader visited Beijing, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China has surpassed the European Union to become Russia\u2019s top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its heavily sanctioned economy. The two\u00a0nuclear-armed neighbors have also continued to hold joint military exercises, including with Iran. Meanwhile, the US has accused China of providing Russia with dual-use goods that bolster the warring nation\u2019s military industrial complex as it attacks Ukraine, which Beijing denies. In his opening remarks Wednesday, Xi told Putin that China and Russia should \u201ckeep upholding the original aspiration\u201d of their \u201clasting friendship\u201d in the face of \u201can international situation fraught with turbulence and changes.\u201d Xi also hailed the \u201cunique value\u201d in China-Russia relations, urging the two countries to make new efforts to safeguard their \u201clegitimate rights and interests\u201d and \u201cthe basic norms governing international relations.\u201d \u201cChina and Russia should continue to strengthen comprehensive strategic coordination, oppose external interference and jointly safeguard regional tranquility and stability,\u201d Xi said, according to a\u00a0readout\u00a0from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry.

{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd", "text": "Pollsters were surprised by the burst of populism in 2016, but many now think they shouldn\u2019t have been. In the United States and United Kingdom, swaths of voters in deprived regions \u2013 places \u201cleft behind\u201d by globalization \u2013 were given the chance to stick it to the system, and they took it. Why was anyone surprised? Pollsters have now been surprised by another trend. In this month\u2019s European Parliament elections, far-right parties performed predictably well \u2013 but especially, and unexpectedly, among young people. A few years ago, \u201cGeneration Climate\u201d \u2013 thought to be unquestionably liberal and progressive \u2013 were voting mostly green. But now, their vote has helped far-right parties capture one in four seats in Brussels. What happened? Perhaps the \u201cleft behind\u201d is not only a geographical phenomenon, but generational. Gen-Z - those born between 1995 and 2012 - has been baptized in crises: first the financial, then the eurozone, then of the pandemic and now of war in Europe. More and more young people believe they will have harder lives than their parents. Why should a left-behind generation be less vulnerable to the lure of populism than left-behind places? Roberto Foa, co-director of the Centre for the Future of Democracy at the University of Cambridge, a leading researcher of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, sees \u201ctwo big divides\u201d in Western societies: \u201cThe wealth divide between economically successful and left-behind regions, and the intergenerational divide in life opportunities.\u201d Political scientists may have overlooked both cohorts because they have long been disconnected. But now their apathy is turning into antipathy \u2013 a desire, once more, to stick it to the system. \u201cIf you are a political entrepreneur who is seeking to break the established party system, those are your options, in terms of mobilizing fresh support,\u201d Foa told CNN. The trend, he says, has been a long time coming: \u201cI\u2019m surprised that people are surprised.\u201d Youth support for far-right parties is being felt in several European countries. In Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), won 16% of the under-25 vote in the EU elections \u2013 tripling its share in that demographic from the previous vote in 2019. Among French voters under 34, the National Rally (RN) was the most popular party, with 32% of the vote \u2013 a 10-point rise compared to 2019. In Poland, 30% of under-30 voters supported the far-right Confederation party, up from 18.5% in 2019. Far-right parties enjoyed a similar uptick in support in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria, and continued to do well in Italy. How alarmed \u2013 and surprised \u2013 should mainstream parties be? Generation, not geography Consider these policy proposals. Young people will pay no income tax. If they start a business, they will be exempt from corporation tax for five years. Students working part-time will have their wages topped up by the state, which will also build 100,000 units of student housing. They can also travel by train for free. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking this must be the platform of the far left. But no: This was RN doyenne Marine Le Pen\u2019s offer in the 2022 French presidential election, which she narrowly lost. Young people, unsurprisingly, loved it. Just under 50% of 25-to-34-year-olds who cast a vote opted for Le Pen, compared to just 41% of the general population and 29% of voters over 70. Whereas the \u201cgray vote\u201d took Donald Trump to the White House and Britain from the EU, it kept the French far right at bay. That may soon change. After his Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right in the EU elections, President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election, which could result in Jordan Bardella, the RN\u2019s 28-year-old leader, becoming France\u2019s prime minister next month. For Arthur Prevot, manager of the RN\u2019s youth wing in Paris, this is great news. Macron\u2019s presidency has failed to deliver for young people, he says. \u201cPurchasing power has decreased incredibly over the past seven years. Between the \u2018gilets jaunes\u2019 crisis, the rise in fuel prices, and all the different taxes that have been introduced \u2013 all of this impacts daily life, including mine,\u201d Prevot, 22, told CNN. His economic concerns prompted him to join the party which may soon govern France, although Macron will remain president. Jonathan Verbeken, a deputy RN candidate in Paris\u2019 15th district, said the main reason he joined the party was because, \u201cwe see people suffering daily, struggling to make ends meet. We see a deplorable situation in France, specifically with security and immigration. We want to react to that.\u201d To many older voters, the RN remains a terrifying prospect. Despite its years-long effort to \u201cnormalize,\u201d previous generations remember its antisemitic, neofascist origins. But young voters appear less concerned by these roots, says Simon Schnetzer, author of a recent survey of Germany\u2019s youth. \u201cYoung people are first-time voters. They are a blank sheet. What drives their decisions most is: Who can offer me something that best fits my needs?\u201d he told CNN. The lack of historical baggage, coupled with the strange death of center-left parties in many parts of Europe, has allowed the far right to appear respectable and armed with economic solutions to young people\u2019s problems. Sarah-Lee Heinrichs, a 23-year-old politician for the German Green Party, said economic concerns have become far more prevalent among young people since the last European Parliament elections in 2019, when the Greens became the second largest party in Germany for the first time. In the wake of the pandemic, the full-scale war in Ukraine and the return of soaring inflation, environmentalism is no longer young people\u2019s priority, she says. \u201cIf governments don\u2019t provide social security \u2013 good jobs and a place to live that doesn\u2019t cost more than 50% of your income every month \u2013 then the far-right will rise,\u201d Heinrichs told CNN. And with economic insecurity is coming fiercer opposition to immigration, nearly a decade after the continent \u2013 and especially Germany - welcomed a record number of refugees fleeing war in Syria. An alarming new trend began last month, after a short clip filmed on the German vacation island of Sylt was posted on X. In the video, well-dressed German youths belt out \u201cAusl\u00e4nder Raus!\u201d (\u201cforeigners out!\u201d) and \u201cDeutschland den Deutschen!\u201d (\u201cGermany for Germans!\u201d) over a 1999 Eurodance beat. The chant has since swirled across the country, currently hosting the European soccer championships. Its appeal is not confined to Germans. As Italy played Spain last week, fans in the stadium could be heard giving their own rendition. Swiping right If that\u2019s the \u201cdemand\u201d side, what about the supply? After her center-right bloc secured the most seats in the European Parliament, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen took to the stage in Brussels to give a victory speech. But her tone was more somber than victorious. She spoke of the importance of defending European values: integration, democracy and the rule of law. How do these abstract values sound to young voters? \u201cYoung people will double check, does that help me with any of my needs? Does it entertain me? Does it give me security? Is it fun? And if it\u2019s none of that, it\u2019s boring,\u201d said Schnetzer. \u201cIf you have this TikTok logic, you\u2019ll quickly swipe further.\u201d While Europe\u2019s mainstream gives grave speeches, the far right is developing vast followings on social media platform TikTok. The RN\u2019s clean-shaven Bardella posts videos of himself wine tasting and doing shots. Maximilian Krah, the AfD\u2019s lead candidate going into\u00a0the EU elections, offers his followers dating advice: \u201cDon\u2019t watch porn, don\u2019t vote for the Greens.\u201d In one TikTok, Nigel Farage \u2013 often described as the \u201carchitect\u201d of Brexit \u2013 approaches a fruit store, says \u201clovely melons,\u201d raises his eyebrows and walks off. The clip has been viewed 2.5 million times. Farage seems aware of this burgeoning market and keen to exploit it. In a recent interview, he praised misogynist online influencer Andrew Tate for being an \u201cimportant voice\u201d for \u201cemasculated\u201d young boys. Tate \u2013 who has racked up billions of views on TikTok \u2013 is facing charges in Romania of human trafficking and rape, which he denies. But those who have puzzled over Tate\u2019s appeal to young men should not be surprised that politicians making jokes about breasts enjoy similar success. The distinction between politicians and entertainment has long grown fuzzy \u2013 but for today\u2019s young, they no longer even exist in separate spaces. Just one swipe separates the voice of a figure like Tate and the voice of a politician. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised if here is where ideas are shaped. Thrill of the new It is not yet clear how deeply these far-right sympathies are held. In a trend especially pronounced among young people, voters are increasingly \u201cnot loyal to any particular party or platform,\u201d says Foa. \u201cThey\u2019re very volatile between one election and the next.\u201d Just as young voters campaigned vociferously for green parties in 2019, their allegiances could switch again. The appeal of the far right may also be dampened if its politicians begin to govern. Out of office, the far right is unable to break promises, while it can point endlessly to the mainstream\u2019s inability to deliver. Once in government, it will prove just as disappointing. That, at least, appears to be\u00a0Macron\u2019s theory. But the burst in support for far-right parties could spell a darker trend. In his studies of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, Foa noted a growing penchant for authoritarianism. Lacking a personal memory of life under authoritarian rule or the struggle to achieve democracy, young people are less enamored with the system than previous generations. This success of far-right parties should be a warning to Europe\u2019s mainstream. To Churchill\u2019s famous quote, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others,\u201d we should not be surprised if young people ask in reply: \u201cReally?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_shohei-ohtani-japanese-tourism-los-angeles", "text": "Her nails are painted blue and white. There\u2019s a Dodgers logo on one nail, the number 17 on another. Takayo Hizume had gone to a nail salon at home in Japan to get them done, then flew about 10 hours to Los Angeles, spending a great deal \u2014 considering the weak yen \u2014 to stay several days in California. The effort is all for one person: Shohei Ohtani. The six-foot-four star hitter and pitcher has been drawing fans from across the Pacific for years. But with his\u00a0historic Dodgers contract, the influx of Japanese tourists has reached a fever pitch in Los Angeles\u00a0for\u00a0Ohtani\u2019s first season with the team. And he\u2019s not even pitching yet. Ohtani, who is\u00a0recovering from elbow surgery, is hitting this season but not expected to start pitching for the Dodgers until 2025. Still, a major Japanese travel agency told CNN it\u2019s now booking up to 200 clients from Japan at every Dodgers home game. And with 12 new Japanese sponsors, Japanese-language stadium tours and new Japanese menu items, the Dodgers are making the most of the Ohtani effect. Japan\u2019s \u2018son\u2019 When asked why she traveled halfway across the world to see a baseball game, Hizume said Ohtani feels like her own son. Hizume spoke in Japanese, while the general manager of the Miyako Hotel \u2013 where she was staying in Los Angeles \u2013 stood next to her and translated. Hizume explained that she felt a connection because her son played baseball, and she feels Ohtani is like Japan\u2019s son. Akira Yuhara, the general manager, said that this is a common sentiment among those in Japan, feeling as if Ohtani is representative of the best of the country\u2019s young men. \u201cPeople like Shohei\u2019s heart. He\u2019s [a] very honest person,\u201d Yuhara said. His honesty seemed cemented in fans\u2019 esteem after\u00a0federal investigators cleared him\u00a0in a recent sports betting scandal, in which his former interpreter pleaded guilty of swindling Ohtani out of $17 million. \u201cHe\u2019s just a phenomenal individual, right?\u201d said Judy Clow, who brought her brother from Japan to a Japanese-language tour at Dodger Stadium. \u201cWait till he starts pitching for us! My gosh!\u201d Some Japanese fans said they had traveled abroad to see him play before. Some had gone as far as South Korea, while others had made it to Southern California within the last few years when Ohtani played for the Los Angeles Angels, who are located southeast of LA in Anaheim. Some of the six new Japanese-language tour guides at Dodger Stadium actually worked at Angels Stadium previously, serving the same fans. Even when there is no home Dodgers game, groups of Japanese visitors gather at an empty Dodger Stadium for the chance to see the dugout, the field, the press box and championship trophies. Japanese-language tours are offered four days a week. Global flair for America\u2019s pastime In addition to Japanese-language tours, visitors find familiar flavors and ads as well. Christine Gerriets, executive chef at Dodger Stadium, said that the stadium offers all the traditional ballpark eats like Dodger dogs, as well as some new items, like chicken katsu sandwiches, sushi, Kurobuta pork sausages, and takoyaki, which are Japanese round fritters filled with octopus. \u201cWe had to put a little bit of LA flair to the takoyaki,\u201d Gerriets said, pointing out traditional and tempura flavors, alongside one with salsa and cheese, and another covered in guacamole. Mihana Hayashi, an Ohtani fan from Nagoya, Japan, said the guacamole and cheese takoyaki had great \u201cAmerican taste,\u201d perhaps symbolic of how being American often means blending global cultures. And celebrating \u201cAmerica\u2019s pastime\u201d involves welcoming throngs of global fans. Hayashi and her sister had traveled to see Ohtani before. When asked why they were such fans, her sister Nanoha said, \u201cHe\u2019s [a] good baseball player and so cute!\u201d The frenzy at home games\u00a0begins long before\u00a0the game\u00a0starts. Groups who are part of special VIP tours, along with a gaggle of Japanese and American media, gather behind ropes on the field, as they watch Ohtani emerge from the dugout to warm up. In early July, the Dodgers hosted \u201cJapanese Heritage Night,\u201d featuring performers and giveaways sponsored by\u00a0Japanese retailer\u00a0Daiso. In the distance, the ad boards along the sides of the stadium are covered with signs from Daiso and other new Japanese sponsors, like Toyo Tires and probiotic beverage company Yakult. Stan Kasten, president and CEO of the Dodgers, said the ad real estate was sold out at home, so sponsors are now buying space at other stadiums when the Dodgers play away games. \u201cWe were expecting a spike but truly nothing like this,\u201d Kasten said. \u201cThis is good for everyone. This is good for all of baseball. And I think all of baseball is really proud at what we are experiencing opening this up in a much bigger way to our international fan base.\u201d \u2018LA Rising\u2019 Kasten said there are tour buses dropping off fans from Japan at Dodger Stadium \u201cmorning and night.\u201d Many of those tour buses are also stopping in Little Tokyo, where these visitors can see the 150-foot-tall Ohtani mural that has made headlines in Japan. The artwork, entitled \u201cLA Rising,\u201d was painted freehand by artist Robert Vargas, on the side of the Miyako Hotel. Fans stop at the street corner, point their phones at a QR code on the sidewalk, then raise their phones to the mural to see an augmented reality where Ohtani swings, then pitches, before they hear the sound of announcer Vin Scully saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time for Dodger baseball!\u201d Vargas said he painted this piece in nine days at the beginning of the season, to bring everyone together at the crossroads of Los Angeles\u2019 Asian American and Latino American communities. \u201cThis area\u2019s been hard hit during Covid, and I really felt like as a long-time resident of downtown LA I wanted to be able to contribute to the AAPI community and support that,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cOhtani represents how to do things the right way on and off the field. And I wanted to celebrate that.\u201d Impressive stats Businesses like the Miyako Hotel, Mr. Ramen, and Far Bar, among others, say their foot traffic has doubled compared to this time last year. \u201cIn 2023, LA welcomed 230,000 visitors from Japan which was a 91.7% increase from 2022,\u201d said Adam Burke, president and CEO of Los Angeles Tourism. \u201cOur goal with this market would be to bring more Japanese to the city and certainly have them experience LA\u2019s sports teams, but also expand their horizons to experience other authentic and diverse LA neighborhoods and encourage longer lengths of stay.\u201d While the organization says international tourism has been improving with pandemic recovery, a 91.7% increase in visitors specifically from Japan far outpaces the overall growth in international tourists during the same year. Additionally, LA Tourism estimates that 80% to 90% of visitors from Japan go to Dodger Stadium at least once during their visit to Los Angeles. Yuhara sees that in practice, when at 3 p.m. on any home game day, Miyako Hotel\u2019s lobby is full of guests from Japan, wearing Dodgers gear, ready to head out the door. He said rooms are fully booked during home game series. In a search for downtown Los Angeles hotel rooms, CNN found higher hotel rates during Dodger home games. This difference of hotel rates per night can sometimes be upwards of $100. However, for some game days all the way into September, hotels like the Miyako are completely sold out. Across the street, Mr. Ramen, which has been serving up noodles for more than 30 years, offers a 50% discount on the first 17 bowls of ramen the day after any Ohtani home run. Far Bar offers a free shot after each Ohtani home run. The owner of Far Bar, Don Tahara, said it\u2019s a unifying moment: \u201cWhen Shohei comes to bat, that\u2019s when the conversations stop.\u201d Whether fans are from Japan, Japanese American like Tahara, or have no connection to Japan at all, the craze continues in full swing.

I think that Ralph Lauren is able to understand that ethos and bring it to life,\u201d Lauren continued. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the dream \u2014 that is the American dream for us at Ralph Lauren and for everybody watching.\u201d Flying the flag for American fashion At the opening ceremony, which will see Olympians traveling down the River Seine on boats towards the city\u2019s famed Trocad\u00e9ro, Team USA athletes will wear a classic navy Ralph Lauren blazer with red and white detailing, paired with a striped Oxford shirt, navy knit tie, and tapered light denim jeans. Denim is also a prominent feature in the closing ceremony ensembles. For this occasion, Ralph Lauren designed a racecar-style jacket with USA patch detailing, a a classic striped polo and crisp white jeans. \u201cI think this collection in its entirety does a really good job of combining classic American style with a little bit more of that contemporary feel,\u201d Paralympic swimmer Jamal Hill, a bronze medal-winner at the 2020 Tokyo Games, told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m wearing this to the all-white party,\u201d he noted, with a laugh, of the closing ceremony look in particular, adding, \u201cmy only regret is that when I come home, the season for all-white will be almost over.\u201d The athletes honored as Team USA\u2019s flag bearers at the opening and closing ceremonies will receive versions of these looks in different colorways to help them stand out in the crowds. Beyond this, athletes will also receive pieces from a special, commemorative \u201cVillagewear\u201d collection.

Dynastic hot dog eating champion Joey Chestnut was not competing, of course, after the 16-time winner struck a deal with plant-based food company Impossible Foods. Bertoletti pulled ahead in the closing minutes to win with 58 hot dogs, after one of the closest races in recent years. Nathan\u2019s Famous competition got underway in historic fashion with the women\u2019s contest as reigning champion Miki Sudo broke a women\u2019s record by eating 51 hot dogs and buns. She beat second place Mayoi Ebihara by 14 hot dogs and buns to secure her 10th title at the contest. \u201cWe finally beat 50, guys,\u201d Sudo told ESPN after her historic performance. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next year.\u201d Bertoletti bested Geoffrey Esper (53) and James Webb (52), who rounded out the top three. This was Bertoletti\u2019s first title in his ninth career appearance, according to the ESPN2 broadcast. But there was a Chestnut-shaped hole in this year\u2019s event. The maestro of mastication has won the \u201cMustard Yellow Belt\u201d 16 times, and ate a world record 76 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes in 2021. If Chestnut was absent from Nathan\u2019s Famous contest, he wasn\u2019t going to allow Independence Day to pass by without taking on a food challenge. The 40-year-old competed in his own live-streamed showcase event, taking on four US Army soldiers at the Fort Bliss base in El Paso, Texas, in an \u201call-beef\u201d hot dog eating event that raised money for military families. Chestnut devoured 57 hot dogs in five minutes while the soldiers he competed against maxed out at a combined 49. \u201cHot dogs on the Fourth of July in front of people who are celebrating America \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get any better than this,\u201d Chestnut said with a championship belt along his shoulder. With 106 total hot dogs eaten, $106,000 was raised and donated to military families. Chestnut had reportedly said he hoped to eat more hotdogs in five minutes than the winner of Nathan\u2019s competition does in 10 minutes. \u201cI think 56 is doable,\u2019\u2019 he had said, per USA Today. \u201cI\u2019d be very happy to do that.\u2019\u2019 What about next year? The Major League Eating (MLE) organization, which oversees the world-renowned event, has emphasized that Chestnut is not banned for life from competing, citing his 20-year relationship with the league. The organization said that, to come back, Chestnut must renounce deals with brands that rival Nathan\u2019s. \u201cJoey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at Nathan\u2019s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest, which he has dominated for years. We hope that he returns when he is not representing a rival brand,\u201d MLE said in a statement. An account under Chestnut\u2019s name posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, Tuesday that he does \u201cnot have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with.\u201d CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the X account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/nathans-famous-hot-dog-eating-contest-joey-chestnut-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_06_23_europe_keir-starmer-labour-profile-uk-election-intl-cmd", "text": "Four-and-a-half years ago, Britain\u2019s Labour Party suffered its worst election defeat since 1935. The historic election victory of Boris Johnson in 2019 \u2013 which allowed him to finally implement Brexit \u2013 was supposed to mark another 10 years of Conservative rule in Britain, with Labour resigned to rebuild on the fringes of politics. Then Labour leader, the hard-left Jeremy Corbyn, was forced to resign and reluctantly hand his party to the centrist Keir Starmer, a former lawyer, knight of the realm and exactly the type of establishment figure that Corbyn and the far-left despise. In little over four years, Starmer has pulled off a once-impossible coup and dragged his Labour Party from the margins of British politics to what is set to be a thumping victory in Thursday\u2019s general election. It will be the first time Labour has been in power since 2010 and the first time it has entered power from opposition since Tony Blair\u2019s historic win in 1997. It was clear going into this election campaign that Britain was screaming out for change after 14 years of Conservative rule that saw cuts in public spending, stretched public services, the chaos of Brexit, a cost-of-living crisis and a sitting prime minister fined by police while in office for the first time in history. Starmer, who had led the opinion polls since October 2021, has promised to be the agent of change that Britain wants. During the campaign, he pledged to grow the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0economy by reforming planning laws and investing in a new industrial strategy. He\u00a0said he\u00a0will set up a national wealth fund with \u00a37.3 billion\u00a0($9.3bn)\u00a0of public money that will help pay for the\u00a0transition to net zero\u00a0emissions. An\u00a0\u00a38.3 billion ($10.5 billion) publicly-owned energy company, Great British Energy, will see the\u00a0United Kingdom\u2019s energy grid\u00a0decarbonized\u00a0by 2030. Starmer says all this can be achieved without raising income taxes, though there are no commitments\u00a0on other levies, such as capital gains tax, which is paid on money made from selling assets, including property and shares. The rest of the\u00a0Labour\u00a0manifesto comprised a mix of modest centrism with soft socialism.\u00a0It included imposing\u00a0taxes on private schools to\u00a0help\u00a0pay for state education\u00a0and windfall\u00a0levies\u00a0on energy companies to fund the transition to clean energy. There were\u00a0also\u00a0commitments on workers\u2019 rights, cutting waiting lists for health care\u00a0and\u00a0also controlling immigration. Critics on the right say that Starmer will need to raise taxes to fund his plans, while\u00a0skeptics\u00a0on the left say his manifesto is not bold or ambitious enough to change Britain for the better. In short,\u00a0this is\u00a0a long list of things to sort out in a five-year term when public finances are in disarray. The question for Starmer\u00a0now\u00a0is whether the mess is too big for him to fix and whether he has the political skill to bring about the change he promised. Who is Keir Starmer? On paper,\u00a0the 61-year-old\u00a0Starmer looks like a classic establishment figure. Once a leading human rights lawyer, he became Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 2008, running the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales \u2013\u00a0a high-profile job for which he was knighted, making him the first ever Labour leader to enter the job with the prefix Sir to their name. Starmer, however, is - by the standards of modern political leaders - from relatively humble beginnings. Born in 1962, Starmer grew up in a small town to the south of London. His father was a toolmaker who worked in a factory, his mother was a nurse who suffered with severe physical disabilities, which ultimately led to one of her legs being amputated. While Starmer has never claimed to have suffered poverty, he has talked of financial struggles that affected his family, as well as the learning difficulties that held back his younger brother. Clearly, these early experiences shaped Starmer\u2019s politics. He has talked about noticing people looking down on his father for working in a factory or bullying his brother. His parents were political, naming their\u00a0eldest after the first Labour leader in parliament, Keir Hardie. \u201cHe\u2019s the first Labour leader in a generation to talk about class and snobbery,\u201d\u00a0Tom Baldwin, author of \u201cKeir Starmer: The Biography,\u201d\u00a0told CNN.\u00a0\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make him a class warrior but someone who understands the different layers of pride, aspiration and guilt\u2026 He feels the sting of the disrespect his dad experienced\u2026 He talks a lot about his sister who has led a precarious life as a carer, having not gone to university.\u201d Starmer chose to study law at the University of Leeds, before completing a postgraduate\u00a0degree\u00a0at the University of Oxford. He initially thought he would have a legal career working for trade unions, but as his politics evolved in line with his studies, he became increasingly interested in human rights. What does he believe? Starmer has been on something of a journey since entering politics. He was elected to Parliament in 2015 at the age of 52 and\u00a0entered\u00a0the shadow cabinet\u00a0a\u00a0little over a year later. Corbyn,\u00a0then the Labour leader, made Starmer his Brexit chief following the 2016 referendum. Corbyn is a controversial figure in British politics and serving in his top team is still something that haunts Starmer. Corbyn had historically been\u00a0on\u00a0the far left of the Labour Party. Prior to becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn had at various points in his long career supported nuclear disarmament,\u00a0and\u00a0withdrawal from NATO, and said it was a \u201ctragedy\u201d that Osama bin Laden was killed rather than put on trial. Starmer was in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet\u00a0for\u00a0the 2017 and 2019 general elections \u2013 something the Conservatives bring up regularly as evidence that he is a threat to national security, having tried twice to make Corbyn prime minister. However, Starmer has since kicked Corbyn out of\u00a0the\u00a0Labour Party following an investigation into\u00a0antisemitism\u00a0during Corbyn\u2019s time as leader. Starmer\u00a0has also said\u00a0that he supported Corbyn knowing he would lose. Pressed on that point in a BBC \u201cQuestion Time\u201d program, he said Corbyn \u201cwould be a better prime minister\u201d than \u201cwhat we got\u201d in\u00a0Boris Johnson. Starmer also argues\u00a0that he\u00a0has brought Labour back to a position of electability. This result proves that he was right, but critics of Starmer on the left say that he used Corbyn and\u00a0his wing\u00a0of the Labour Party to win the party leadership in 2020 \u2013 committing to\u00a0several\u00a0left-wing positions\u00a0such as\u00a0nationalizing public services, scrapping university tuition fees and reversing\u00a0Conservative welfare reforms \u2013 only to abandon those pledges\u00a0once he got closer to\u00a0power. James Schneider, Corbyn\u2019s former communications chief, told CNN: \u201cStarmer is not a principled man. His campaign to become Labour leader was systemically dishonest. His cynicism and lack of policies to improve people\u2019s lives will lead to a deep disillusionment that could either feed the hard right or a future people\u2019s movement for change.\u201d Starmer has at various times responded to accusations that he has drifted politically by saying that he puts his country before his political party, and that it\u2019s only possible to change things if you are in power. Can Starmer change Britain? Whether you think Starmer\u2019s\u00a0current\u00a0plan is unambitious, dishonest, or exactly what Britain needs, it\u2019s impossible to push through policy without political and personal capital. Dominic Grieve, a Conservative politician who served as\u00a0attorney\u00a0general while Starmer was DPP, speaks glowingly of this period. \u201cHe ran his department very efficiently and effectively at a really difficult time because his budget had been cut. It was genuinely very impressive,\u201d\u00a0Grieve told CNN. Grieve\u00a0added\u00a0that Starmer was able to be an effective manager because \u201che is not bogged down with years of political ideology or baggage. He can see what is wrong and can address it.\u201d Much as Starmer\u2019s allies might see this as a strength, his opponents, from both sides of politics,\u00a0see it as a weakness. To those on the right, Starmer is a man who would say anything to get in power. He is someone who\u00a0supported\u00a0Corbyn \u2013\u00a0who is anti-NATO and has repeatedly been accused of being a terrorist\u00a0sympathizer \u2013\u00a0to get what he wants and is a danger to Britain. To the left, he is someone who doesn\u2019t have the conviction\u00a0to make radical changes\u00a0and, once in office,\u00a0will not be materially that different to a Conservative leader. Starmer\u00a0is now set to have\u00a0an\u00a0enormous majority in the\u00a0House of Commons. But\u00a0the future may not be so simple.\u00a0Given\u00a0the current state of Britain\u2019s finances, the circumstances of\u00a0Labour\u2019s\u00a0victory and, even Starmer\u2019s own personality traits, it might mean he doesn\u2019t have quite the blank check\u00a0that a leader with virtually no opposition\u00a0in parliament\u00a0would typically enjoy. An\u00a0inability to turn that parliamentary power into tangible results\u00a0at a time when voters are crying out for something different\u00a0could mean that five years from now, his moderate, safety-first center-left program may ultimately be\u00a0seen as\u00a0just as big a political gamble as any of those the Conservatives took in the\u00a0past 14 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/europe/keir-starmer-labour-profile-uk-election-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

The captain for France\u2019s national soccer team, who is preparing for Les Bleus\u2019 Euro 2024 quarterfinal against Portugal in Hamburg on Friday, urged the French public to vote saying \u201cnow more than ever\u201d it was needed. \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency, we can\u2019t let our country in the hands of these people, it\u2019s really urgent,\u201d Mbappe said at a media conference in Hamburg, Germany. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s shock announcement in June to call snap parliamentary elections plunged France into political uncertainty and has roiled financial markets, with the far right having a shot at real political power. After a high turnout at the polls, last Sunday the RN clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party slumped to third. If the RN assumes power, it would become the first far-right party to enter the French government since\u00a0World War\u00a0II\u00a0\u2013 although nothing is certain\u00a0ahead of Sunday\u2019s\u00a0second round. The second round of voting is poised to take place this coming Sunday and Mbapp\u00e9 hopes \u201ceveryone will mobilize to vote.\u201d \u201cWe really hope that it\u2019ll change and that everyone will mobilize to vote and make the right choice,\u201d said the France captain. This isn\u2019t the first time that Mbapp\u00e9\u00a0has spoken about French politics while he\u2019s been with the French national soccer team at Euro 2024. \u201cThis is a never-seen-before event,\u201d\u00a0France\u2019s talisman, told reporters, per Reuters, last month. \u201cAnd that is why I want to talk to the whole of the French people, but also the youth. \u201cWe are a generation that can make a difference. We see the extremes are knocking on the door of power and we have the opportunity to shape our country\u2019s future.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9, whose family originally come from Algeria and Cameroon, stressed that he didn\u2019t want to \u201crepresent a country\u201d that didn\u2019t embody his \u201cvalues.\u201d Earlier this week, Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s Les Bleus teammate Jules\u00a0Kounde \u2013 a 25-year old French Beninese national \u2013 used a media conference during the Euros tournament to share what he called his own \u201cpolitical position.\u201d \u201cI was disappointed to see the direction France is taking, with strong support for a party against our values \u2026 I believe it\u2019s important to block the extreme right, the National Rally, because this party will not lead our country towards more freedom,\u201d\u00a0Kounde\u00a0told journalists after the last-16 match between France and Belgium on Monday.

{"id": "2024_07_04_asia_modi-putin-russia-india-visit-intl", "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Moscow next week for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, a sign of the growing relationship between the two countries even as New Delhi maintains strong ties with the United States. Modi will be in Moscow on July 8 and 9 at the invitation of President Vladimir Putin, India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs announced, adding they would \u201cexchange views on contemporary regional and global issues of mutual interest.\u201d Modi\u2019s plans for the trip were first reported last month by Russian state media, citing Kremlin officials. India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment \u2013 a vital link given India\u2019s ongoing tensions at its shared Himalayan border with China \u2013 and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Modi\u2019s visit is widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. India\u2019s ties with Russia date back decades to the Cold War and have remained strong despite repeated sanctions on Moscow from Western governments. New Delhi has repeatedly abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations Security Council and has avoided public criticism of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. Confirmation of Modi\u2019s visit comes as Russia draws ever closer to China, potentially making New Delhi uncomfortable due to its longstanding Himalayan border dispute with Beijing that has simmered in recent years. On Wednesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Putin hailed their two countries\u2019 deepening alignment at a regional security summit in Kazakhstan, with the Russian leader claiming relations between the two were going through \u201cthe best period in their history\u201d and should be considered a \u201cstabilizing\u201d force for the world. Modi, however, was notably absent from the annual leaders\u2019 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a bloc of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia that is seen as a counterweight to Western institutions led by the US and its allies. Some analysts viewed Modi\u2019s decision to skip the event as a sign the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy does not view the bloc as an effective channel through which New Delhi can pursue its interests. Modi last met Putin on the sidelines of the 2022 SCO summit, where he told the Russian leader that today\u2019s era is \u201cnot of war.\u201d Yet his upcoming visit to Moscow is being viewed positively by the Kremlin \u2013 which has described Modi\u2019s relationship with Putin as \u201cvery trusting\u201d in nature \u2013 and comes as Russia aims to push back against Western efforts to isolate it on the world stage as punishment for its war in Ukraine. \u201cWe can expect that there will be an exchange of views on all issues that are on the agenda, and there are many of them,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russia\u2019s state-run news agency TASS on Tuesday. Last month Putin also met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang, where the two autocrats vowed to strengthen ties and deepen their cooperation in a new partnership that was signed during the visit. Moscow this year has taken up the position as chair of the BRICS economic bloc, which includes Brazil, India, China and South Africa, providing Putin with an opportunity to push back against growing Western isolation and portray himself as a key player on a broad diplomatic stage. But Modi\u2019s visit is set against the backdrop of India\u2019s growing relations with the US, as both countries share concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington in June last year, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. India is a member of the Quad security grouping with the US, Japan and Australia. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_07_02_asia_india-uttar-pradesh-crush-intl", "text": "A crowd crush at a religious gathering in northern India killed more than a hundred people Tuesday, mostly women, in one of the deadliest such incidents the country has seen in recent years. Many of the scores killed had fallen into an open sewer next to the venue. Police are investigating the organizers, saying a quarter of a million people arrived at the venue - more than three times the number expected - and just a few dozen police officers had been deployed. Investigators are pursuing Bhole Baba, the self-styled godman who led the event. The disaster happened at a prayer meeting, known as a satsang, in Mughal Garhi village in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state. The village, in Hathras district, is around 200 kilometers (124 miles) southeast of the capital New Delhi. At least 121 people died and 35 others were injured, Sandeep Singh, the Minister of State for Education, told reporters Wednesday, after a large number of people rushed to touch Bhole Baba\u2019s feet, leading to a crush. Almost all those killed were women, Singh said earlier, with at least seven children also among the dead. About 72 bodies have been identified so far, and dozens of injured people are being treated in nearby hospitals, according to local health officials. Local officials have suggested overcrowding was the cause of the crush. An estimated 80,000 people had been expected to attend the event, where Bhole Baba was giving a sermon. However, \u201ca lot more people showed up,\u201d Singh said. Police have been on the hunt for Bhole Baba since the deadly incident and have accused the event\u2019s organizers of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, wrongfully restraining a person, causing disappearance of evidence or providing false information, according to a police report seen by CNN. \ufeffPermission was sought for the event with 80,000 attendees, however a crowd of more than 250,000 devotees gathered, the report said. Organizers and officials tried to direct the crowd as thousands attempted to leave and in the ensuing chaos dozens were trampled, it added. The report alleged that event organizers provided no assistance to the injured and attempted to cover up the incident by hiding the clothes and shoes that people had lost in the crush in a nearby field. About 40 policemen had been deployed to provide security at the event, additional director general of Agra police, Anupam Kulshreshtha, told reporters. The deadly scenes unfolded after the event had finished, when Bhole Baba\u2019s devotees rushed toward the stage to touch his feet, according to chief secretary Singh, who described scenes of chaos as people began to fall on top of each other and into an open sewer nearby. He accused the organizers of failing to comply with a list of requirements given by the district. A high-level inquiry has been launched to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident and a police report will be filed against the event organizers for allegedly exceeding permitted attendance levels, according to local officials. \u201cThere has been a major lapse on the part of the organizers. They will face a strict punishment,\u201d he said. Survivors spoke of the harrowing incident in its aftermath. \u201cPeople started falling one upon another, one upon another. Those who were crushed died. People there pulled them out,\u201d Shakuntala Devi told the Press Trust of India news agency, according to the Associated Press. Efforts are underway to provide the injured with medical care and arrangements are being made for post-mortem examinations at various locations, said Inspector General Shalabh Mathur, of the neighboring district Ambala Range. A video distributed by Reuters showed crowds gathering outside a hospital in the nearby Etah district, where distraught families cried for the victims. Medical personnel could be seen carrying people on stretchers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences in a parliamentary address. Modi said the government is conducting \u201crelief and rescue work\u201d and is coordinating with the state government. \u201cThe victims will be helped in every way,\u201d he said. Crowd crushes at religious gatherings in India are not uncommon, and deadly incidents have made headlines in the past, highlighting the lack of adequate crowd control and safety measures. A new year\u2019s crush in January 2022 at one of India\u2019s holiest shrines in Jammu, in the north of the country, killed at least a dozen people. In 2008, nearly 150 people who had gathered for a religious event in western India died in a hilltop crowd crush, and three years prior, more than 250 people were trampled to death during a pilgrimage in the western state of Maharashtra.

Muhammed Neamah Naser, a commander in Hezbollah\u2019s Aziz Unit, was \u201celiminated\u201d on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, blaming him for directing terror attacks both before and after Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks from Gaza The IDF described him as a counterpart of Sami Taleb Abdullah, another Hezbollah commander whose killing last month also triggered a wave of retaliatory strikes. \u201cTogether, they served as two of the most significant\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0terrorists in southern Lebanon,\u201d the IDF said. In response to the killing, Hezbollah on Thursday said it had launched \u201cmore than 200 missiles of various types\u201d at Israeli targets. The Israeli military said that it intercepted some of those Hezbollah missiles, as well as drones. Some fires broke out as a result of falling shrapnel. In response to those strikes, the IDF said their\u00a0fighter jets have struck Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon\u00a0overnight Wednesday into Thursday. The\u00a0IDF said they struck a\u00a0military structure and three\u00a0\u201cterrorist infrastructure sites.\u201d Hezbollah said Thursday that one of its fighters had been killed. Naser is the latest Hezbollah commander to be killed in hostilities that flared along the Israel-Lebanon border since the October 7 attacks. Israeli fire services said Thursday that they are working on multiple \u201cextensive fires\u201d in the north of the country \u201cas a result of the heavy shelling from\u00a0Lebanon.\u201d More than 10 fires broke out in the area of the Upper Galilee and the Golan Heights, the Israel Fire and Rescue North District said in a statement,\u00a0\u201cwith some of them creating very extensive fires in challenging terrain.\u201d Over 40 firefighting teams and 10 aircraft were working in the region on five major incidents, the statement said. Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began. But it has been gradually intensifying, raising fears it could escalate into a full-blown conflict. Hezbollah is one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, boasting of tens of thousands of fighters and a vast missile arsenal. The group has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 300\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0fighters and some 90 civilians, according to Reuters tallies. Meanwhile, Israel says fire from Lebanon has killed 18 soldiers and 10 civilians. Eugenia Yosef\u00a0contributed to this report.
