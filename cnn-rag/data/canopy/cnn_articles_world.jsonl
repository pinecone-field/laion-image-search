Sustainable aviation fuel is not being produced fast enough and there seem to be few alternatives on the horizon to fuel-hungry jet engines and turboprops. One problem is that electrification is not as easy with planes as it is with road vehicles, and the consensus in the industry seems to be that battery technology needs to evolve before electric passenger aircraft can become a reality. However, Dutch startup Elysian is challenging that assumption with its plans for a fully electric regional aircraft, with a range of 500 miles (805 kilometers) and space for 90 passengers, capable of reducing emissions by 90% \u2014\u00a0which it aims to fly commercially within a decade. \u201cMany experts say you need battery technology beyond [anything that will be available until] 2050 to get reasonable range and payload capability,\u201d says Reynard de Vries, director of design and engineering at Elysian. \u201cBut the question we asked ourselves was, \u2018how do I get the maximum range for the battery technology that we already have?\u2019 One can fly much farther with battery-powered electric aircraft than what most studies claim \u2014 if you make the right choices.\u201d Unconventional design The plane, called E9X, exists only on paper for now \u2014 Elysian plans to build a scale model within two to three years, and a full-scale prototype by 2030. However, its main design features are already known, and are somewhat surprising. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t assume that an electric plane is going to look like the (most successful) planes of today,\u201d de Vries says, adding that a common misconception is that electric planes should essentially be electrified versions of the lightest regional turboprops. That, he says, would make the range too limited, likely below 60 miles. \u201cWhat you really have to do is design it from scratch, starting with a blank sheet. What you end up with is a plane that in weight proportions, for example, looks much more like old 1960s jets. A plane with a very high proportion of batteries and a much lower proportion of structural weight. The result is an aircraft that\u2019s much larger and heavier, but can fly much farther than people previously thought.\u201d The E9X will have eight propeller engines and a wingspan of almost 138 feet (42 meters) \u2014 larger than a Boeing 737 or an Airbus A320, though both can carry more than double the passengers \u2014 as well as a thinner fuselage, which de Vries says improves both the structural and aerodynamic characteristics. This design is the result of a collaboration with the Delft University of Technology, the oldest and largest technical university in the Netherlands, and its principles are explained in a scientific paper titled \u201cA new perspective on battery-electric aviation,\u201d which has de Vries and Rob Wolleswinkel, Elysian\u2019s co-founder, among its authors. One key tenet is that the batteries will be placed in the wings rather than the fuselage. \u201cThat\u2019s a critical design choice,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cBatteries represent a significant chunk of the weight of the plane, and what you want to do with weight is put it where the lift is being generated.\u201d The battery technology will be similar to what\u2019s available today, plus whatever advancements will be made in the next four or five years, rather than a radical step up, according to de Vries. \u201cThat opens up different scenarios,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe most conservative one puts the useful range at 300 miles (482 kilometers), but we believe that a more realistic target, four years from now, is 500 miles.\u201d Ready in 45 minutes Among the other known design elements is the placement of the landing gear in the wings rather than the body of the plane, wingtips that can fold up to save space and a gas-turbine-based \u201creserve energy system\u201d that can provide emergency power in case of a diversion. All together, de Vries expects the aircraft\u2019s climate impact to be between 75% and 90% lower than today\u2019s narrowbody jets, even when accounting for the production of the batteries and the electricity used to recharge them. The E9X will be designed to fit within current airport infrastructure, without the need for any adjustment or upgrade. The turnaround time, however, might be a challenge due to the need to charge the batteries, which takes more time than filling up the tank with fuel. \u201cOur target right now is a maximum charging time of 45 minutes, which would imply a slightly longer turnaround time than what some airlines are used to, especially the low-cost operators. But that\u2019s the upper limit \u2014 the average time will be around half an hour.\u201d There are ongoing discussions with airlines around the world, he adds, and the plane will likely attract the interest of regional and commuter airlines. According to de Vries, it could also benefit secondary airfields that are currently underserved because of noise or emissions limitations, or because it\u2019s not economical for airlines to serve them. Finally, from a passenger perspective, he believes the E9X will offer a quieter, more enjoyable flight experience, and he aims to solve one of the most pressing issues with today\u2019s travel: the scarcity of cabin luggage space. The electric age G\u00f6k\u00e7in \u00c7\u0131nar, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan who\u2019s collaborating with de Vries on an upcoming research paper on electrified aircraft design, but has no financial stake in Elysian, notes that the company isn\u2019t introducing groundbreaking technologies per se but rather reconfiguring existing ones to redefine the aircraft\u2019s operational paradigm. \u201cMy research over the past decade has advocated for designing electric planes with operational changes in mind \u2014 it would be imprudent to employ a novel technology following outdated conventions,\u201d says \u00c7\u0131nar. \u201cAlthough there might be some inconveniences, the potential advantages are significant. Elysian\u2019s approach is promising, but it\u2019s just one of many potential applications of electrification in aviation, each with unique operational strategies and technological integrations.\u201d Other companies are working on electric aircraft that would enter service earlier than the E9X, according to their plans. One is British-American ZeroAvia, which has successfully test-flown a 19-seater plane powered by two hydrogen-electric engines, and aims to enter it into service in late 2025. Israeli-founded Eviation has flight-tested its plane, called Alice \u2013 a fully electric nine-passenger commuter plane with a range of 250 nautical miles that the company aims to put into service in 2027. Finally, Swedish manufacturer Heart Aerospace is working on a 30-passenger plane called ES-30 that would have a range of just 100 nautical miles in all-electric configuration, but over 400 when using a combination of electric and traditional turboprop engines; it has only tested a scale model so far, but plans to enter commercial service in 2028. According to Gary Crichlow, an aviation analyst at consultancy firm AviationValues, Elysian faces a tough challenge. \u201cThere are over 5,000 aircraft in service today in the E9X\u2019s size category of 70 to 100 seats,\u201d he says. \u201cOur data shows that these aircraft can remain in service for decades. As a result, it\u2019s very difficult to overstate the incumbency advantage that the established manufacturers have in this market segment.\u201d Any new technology, Crichlow explains, will have to present a compelling case against an installed, proven conventional fleet. Beyond the technology itself, the infrastructure challenge to provide a steady supply of aircraft, training and parts at scale, and a reliable network of charging facilities, will be enormous. If Elysian can surmount the technology and infrastructure challenges, he adds, it will then face the commercial challenge of entering a fiercely competitive market. \u201cA disruptor like Elysian would be welcome, but it is an extremely hard mountain to climb for even an established player to produce and support a product that will be commercially viable over the long term,\u201d Crichlow says. \u201cIt will need very deep pockets.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/elysian-electric-plane-90-passenger-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Emergency crews recovered 50 to 60 bodies in the Tal al-Hawa neighborhood in the west of Gaza City, according to Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense. Many more were trapped under the debris, spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN. Further east in the city, Israeli bombardment destroyed vital infrastructure in the Shujaya neighborhood, said Asem Al-Nabih, a media officer at the Gaza Municipality. Footage obtained by CNN showed rescue staff in Tal al-Hawa wading through blown out buildings, and clambering over slabs of fallen concrete piled on top of old mattresses. The limbs of dead Palestinians could be seen peeking out from under the rubble, as workers attempted to retrieve those buried by the devastation. \u201cThere is unprecedented destruction of infrastructure and vital facilities in the Shujaya\u2026 and Tal al-Hawa areas,\u201d Al-Nabih told CNN. \u201cThe municipality is trying to deliver water to displaced citizens with great difficulty.\u201d More than nine months of fighting in Gaza has turned swathes of the territory into rubble-filled wasteland. The Israeli military offensive following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has triggered a sprawling humanitarian crisis, crushed the health system and depleted food and water supplies. The UN warned Tuesday of widespread famine across the strip, and relief workers say Israeli aid restrictions mean they are unable to support Palestinians trying to survive the war. Human rights agencies reiterated calls for a ceasefire, as negotiations between Israel and Hamas this week hit yet another roadblock. Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed\u00a038,345\u00a0Palestinians and injured another 88,295 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. \u2018We want a total ceasefire\u2019 Palestinian residents surveyed the desolate landscape in Tal al-Hawa neighborhood on Friday, as the sound of Israeli drones buzzed overhead.

The bodies are strewn in the streets for 4 to 5 (days), maybe a week, and no civil defense can evacuate them. Where is the international law?\u201d Another Palestinian, Umm Ihab Arafat, said she and her family had been displaced at least four times since the war erupted. The mother told CNN she was desperate to return home for the wellbeing of her children. \u201cWe want a total ceasefire,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be displaced from one place to another. The fear is in the eyes of the young ones.\u201d A CNN stringer in the area reported Friday there had been a partial withdrawal from several locations \u2013 including Tal Al-Hawa, Al-Rimal and the vicinity of the UNRWA headquarters on Al-Sina\u2019a Street. Further south, in the coastal tent city of Al-Mawasi, two people were killed and five other Palestinians wounded by an airstrike on an aid warehouse, according to the Civil Defense. CNN has provided the Israeli military with the coordinates of the strike and sought comment. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed troops in central Gaza \u201clocated a weapons production workshop\u201d and \u201cfunds used for terrorist activity,\u201d adding that \u201cterrorists who posed a threat to the troops in the area were eliminated.\u201d The IDF also said that it had attacked the site of rocket launches in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza, and had continued assaults in Rafah, southern Gaza. CNN cannot verify the IDF statements. Also in central Gaza, a CNN stringer reported that four Palestinians, including two children, had been killed by an Israeli airstrike in the New Nuseirat camp early Friday. CNN has asked the IDF about its operations in central Gaza. Almost the whole population \u2013 1.9 million people \u2013 have been displaced, according to the UN. Earlier this week, several Palestinians told CNN they were terrified to leave areas in the north under Israeli evacuation orders amid heavy shelling, citing no promise of safety or accommodation.

{"id": "2024_07_14_middleeast_mohammed-deif-hamas-commander-israeli-strike-intl", "text": "Israel has targeted Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Deif in a strike on a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza which killed at least 90 Palestinians. It is not clear yet if Deif was among the dead. But who is he? An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attacks. He has led the Palestinian militant group\u2019s armed wing for more than two decades. If his death is confirmed, Deif would be the highest profile Hamas leader killed since the war in Gaza began nine months ago. Israel has been seeking to dismantle Hamas following the October 7 attacks but with fighting ongoing and senior Hamas figures at large, that goal has seemed distant. Deif is thought to have been born in the 1960s in the Khan Younis refugee camp, one of a number of such camps established in Gaza at the end of the 1940s for displaced Palestinians denied the freedom to return to their homes by the newly-created state of Israel. Born as Mohammad Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, he later became known as \u201cEl Deif\u201d or \u201cthe Guest\u201d due to his habit of staying in different houses every night for decades to avoid being tracked and killed by Israel. Deif has been at the top of Israel\u2019s most wanted list for decades, with Israel holding him responsible for the deaths of dozens of its citizens. Both the US and the EU have him on terror blacklists. He joined Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987. He became a founding member of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, in the early 1990s. The military unit was established to support Hamas in its armed resistance against Israel and has since carried out numerous attacks, including suicide bombings. From the beginning, Deif has been a key architect in Hamas\u2019s strategy against Israel. He was behind a wave of suicide attacks in 1996 that killed 65 people in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as well as other acts intended to derail the Israel-Palestine peace process. Deif rose through the ranks of the Qassam Brigades to be named its leader in 2002, after the previous commander was killed by Israel. Considered a highly-skilled bomb maker, he has played a significant role in developing Hamas\u2019s network of tunnels and bomb-making expertise. Over the years, Deif has survived numerous assassination attempts \u2013 a total of seven, according to Reuters. This includes a 2014 Israeli strike that killed his wife, his seven-month-old son and three-year-old daughter. He was seriously injured in one of the assassination attempts, sustaining serious leg injuries and losing an eye. Deif is understood to have played a role in orchestrating Hamas\u2019s brutal cross-border raids on October 7, which saw around 1,200 Israelis killed. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 38,000 people. Soon after the attacks, he called for a general uprising. \u201cIf you have a gun, get it out. This is the time to use it \u2013 get out with trucks, cars, axes, today the best and most honorable history starts,\u201d he said in a recorded message. In May, the International Criminal Court (ICC) said it was seeking arrest warrants for Deif, as well as Yehiya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019s leader in Gaza, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s political bureau head, saying they had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe they bore responsibility for the October 7 attacks. Deif, a man who lives his life in the shadows, has managed to survive for decades while running Hamas\u2019s armed wing. This achievement has earned him the nickname \u201cthe Cat with Nine Lives.\u201d It remains to be seen, however, whether Deif has survived this latest attempt on his life.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/middleeast/mohammed-deif-hamas-commander-israeli-strike-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

He cannot bring himself to describe all that happened to him and the two other hostages he was kept with during his eight months of captivity in Gaza. After being snatched from the Nova music festival on October 7, Kozlov, a Russian-Israeli citizen, said he was tied up for \u201cthree days with rope, then until the middle of December with chains.\u201d During these months he was subjected to \u201ccreative\u201d forms of punishment: One guard \u201ctold us a lot that Israel wants to kill us\u201d and that they were a problem from which Israel was trying to rid itself. Kozlov strove not to believe the lies, he said, but the result was that, when Israeli soldiers last month burst into the building in which he was being held, he thought they had been sent to kill him. Instead, it was a stunning rescue operation that brought him and the two others home \u2013 as well as Noa Argamani, who was held in a nearby building. But it left in its wake a trail of destruction: Gaza authorities say at least 274 Palestinians were killed in the raid and the ensuing firefight with Hamas militants. In an interview with CNN, Kozlov detailed his months of captivity in Gaza, the psychological torture he weathered, the threats he faced, and his desire for Israel and Hamas to strike a deal to release the remaining hostages. Kozlov was nearing the end of his shift as a security guard at the Nova festival when Hamas fighters began to pour over the border. He had moved from Russia to Israel two years earlier, and taken the job because it was \u201ceasy money.\u201d When he clocked off, Kozlov thought \u201cI will come back home, I will sleep and everything will be good. But no, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Minutes later, he was sprinting through a forest with \u201cmaybe 200, 300 people,\u201d panicked by the sound of gunshots and a stream of gruesome nearby videos that had already emerged online. But as they stumbled out into a field, Kozlov saw \u2013 he recalled in broken English \u2013 \u201ca car full of guys in green uniform. And they shoot in the air, they shoot already on us.\u201d Hiding in the bushes was no help. He was swiftly found and taken to Gaza, where he was held in several different places with Almog Meir Jan and Shlomi Ziv, before their eventual rescue in Nuseirat, in the center of the enclave. On his first day, his captor \u201ctook the fabric from my eyes and showed me with signs\u201d what he was planning to do. The man pointed to himself \u2013 \u201cI\u201d \u2013 then tapped his watch \u2013 \u201ctomorrow\u201d \u2013 then pointed to Kozlov \u2013 \u201cyou\u201d \u2013 then made a camera sign, clicking its shutter \u2013 \u201cfilm\u201d \u2013 then made a gun with his fingers, pulling the trigger \u2013 \u201ckill.\u201d Kozlov said he thought that day would be his last, but \u2013 as the hours passed \u2013 that fear slowly subsided. Days later, he said he understood \u201cthat probably they\u2019re not gonna kill us.\u201d Using signs again, they explained to Kozlov that they wanted to swap him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to Israel, our people go to Gaza and the West Bank.\u201d For the first three months, the sound of Israeli bombing was constant, Kozlov said: \u201cWe were afraid of every bomb that we heard. Every time you started to hide in the corners of our room.\u201d His captors laughed, he said, asking what they were afraid of. They were moved between houses several times, Kozlov said, with some places giving them enough food. After being unchained in December, some places where he was held gave him the chance to exercise \u2013 \u201csquats, pushups\u201d and the like. But he was exposed to prolonged psychological abuse, he said, by guards watching over them wearing masks, holding Kalashnikovs and a \u201cbig knife.\u201d The main guard, he said, had a \u201csplit\u201d personality and often \u201cgot crazy.\u201d \u201cHe has two personalities,\u201d Kozlov said. \u201cHe told us: \u2018I have two faces: A good one, but I don\u2019t want you to see the second face \u2013 like, I can kill you.\u2019\u201d Some mornings, the guard would be friendly, offering to play cards with them. But in other mornings Kozlov would \u201cwake up and you understand \u2013 ah, the second face. You don\u2019t talk with him at all.\u201d Kozlov would be punished for arbitrary things, he said. Once, after washing his hands with drinking water before eating, the guard \u201cnoticed and he said, \u2018I told you not to do this, yes?\u2019\u201d The guard had someone cover Kozlov with \u201creally thick blankets, in the middle of May,\u201d and leave him in the heat for an hour and a half. Kozlov\u2019s testimony chimes with that of other rescued hostages. The doctor in charge of medical treatment for Kozlov and the three others rescued in the Israeli operation said they were beaten and described their captivity as a \u201charsh, harsh experience, with a lot of abuse, almost every day.\u201d \u201cThere have been periods where they got almost no food whatsoever, there were other periods where it was a little better, but all in all, the combination of the psychological stress, malnutrition or not getting enough food\u2026 have a significant effect on health,\u201d Dr. Itai Pessach told CNN last month. Still, Kozlov considers himself \u201clucky.\u201d He said he saw other hostages during his eight months in Gaza, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2026 It\u2019s painful and it\u2019s gonna be dangerous for them,\u201d he said. Were they in worse shape than him? \u201cYes they were.\u201d For that reason, Kozlov implored Israeli officials to \u201ctry to understand how we (the hostages) felt all this time. We need to bring them home as soon as possible. I don\u2019t know how. But we need to do this immediately.\u201d Optimism about a ceasefire-for-hostages deal has waned this week, however, as Hamas warned that Israeli actions in Gaza could jeopardize the talks. Last week, a US official told CNN that a framework agreement is \u201cin place\u201d and an Israeli official said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations, signaling a potential breakthrough. Talks resumed in the Qatari capital Doha last Friday. Over the weekend, Hamas agreed to compromise on a major sticking point for Israel \u2013 that Netanyahu\u2019s government commits to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement. But a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office on Sunday cast doubt on the deal, laying out several \u201cprinciples\u201d Israel is not prepared to abandon, including resumed fighting in Gaza \u201cuntil all objectives of the war have been achieved.\u201d For Kozlov, the days he was captured \u2013 and rescued \u2013 have become landmarks in his life. October 7 became his second \u201cbirthday;\u201d June 8, his third. He wants the 120 remaining hostages to be able to mark their own dates.

The area has been cordoned off as a crime scene, and \u201cpreliminary investigations suggest a similar mode of killing of the deceased,\u201d the statement said. The bodies were found wrapped in \u201cnylon papers and reinforced with nylon ropes\u201d and have been transported to a mortuary where \u201cthey await postmortem examinations,\u201d police added. The identities of the dead or how long the bodies had been at the quarry were not immediately clear. \u201cIt appears to be a dumping site for bodies and I suspect there could be more,\u201d Hussein Khalid, executive director of human rights group Vocal Africa told CNN. \u201cThey were all women, all tied with the same color of ribbons, and same color of sacks,\u201d he said. Angry residents who marched to the nearby Kware police station were dispersed by teargas as shots rang in the air. CNN has reached out to the police for comment. The horrifying scene comes after weeks of anti-government protests over a since-scrapped finance bill. The protests resulted in scores of civilian deaths amid a heavy-handed response from Kenyan police. Human rights groups have also accused security forces of abducting Kenyans during the protests. The discovery of the bodies on Friday has sparked fresh public anger and brought a new spotlight to Kenya\u2019s femicide crisis, just months after thousands of women marched on the streets with banners reading: \u201cStop killing us.\u201d Fallout from protests Dozens of people were killed in police shootings across the country in just one day of the anti-government protests in June, according to\u00a0Kenya\u2019s Police Reforms Working Group (PRWG). A CNN team outside the\u00a0Kenyan parliament on June 25\u00a0witnessed security forces shooting at unarmed protesters. The CNN crew also filmed\u00a0Kenyan police beating and later arresting some paramedics who were helping injured protesters in Nairobi. Kenya\u2019s presidency announced that Japheth Koome, the country\u2019s police chief, resigned on Friday. His deputy, Douglas Kanja, has been named acting police chief. Friday\u2019s move comes after nearly all of President William Ruto\u2019s cabinet was fired, with the exceptions of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua and Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi. The decision was taken \u201cupon reflection, and a holistic appraisal\u201d of his cabinet, he told reporters from State House Nairobi.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Israel had previously agreed to allow Palestinians unrestricted access to northern Gaza during an eventual ceasefire, but the prime minister told his negotiating team this week to demand that armed men be barred from northern Gaza as part of any ceasefire and hostage deal, the source said. The new demand could potentially upend progress in hostage negotiations and raises further questions about Netanyahu\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s own proposal for a deal that has become the basis for detailed negotiations. Last week, a US official told CNN that a framework agreement was \u201cin place\u201d and an Israeli official said that Netanyahu had authorized\u00a0his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations, signaling a potential breakthrough.

{"id": "2024_07_12_style_anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-mumbai-intl-hnk", "text": "After seven months of extravagant pre-wedding celebrations, Anant Ambani, the son of India\u2019s richest man, completed his long-awaited marriage to pharmaceutical heiress Radhika Merchant before thousands of guests on Friday. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra and former British prime ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were just some of the famous faces who flew in to Mumbai to attend the star-studded event. The wedding also attracted many of the biggest names in Indian entertainment, sport, business and politics, from Bollywood stars like Rajinikanth and Sanjay Dutt, to former president Ram Nath Kovind, the chief ministers of various states and numerous members of the country\u2019s revered cricket team. No expense was spared by the Ambanis, the family behind India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. In a rain-soaked Mumbai, police closed roads in the area surrounding the Ambani-owned, 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Center ahead of a red-carpet-style arrival event. Attendees dressed the part, streaming past photographers in custom sarees, lehengas and kurtas at an event that may set forthcoming trends in Indian wedding fashion. International guests also honored the traditional dress code, with many seen wearing designs by major Indian fashion designers. John Cena walked the red carpet in an embroidered sky blue sherwani and white pants, while Jonas sparkled in a\u00a0baby pink version \u2014 made from a boucl\u00e9-style woven fabric embedded with sequins\u00a0\u2014 and matching satin trousers. Jonas arrived with his wife and actor, Priyanka Chopra, who opted for an intricately embellished sunshine yellow lehengai. The fashion crowd were out in full force too. Zendaya\u2019s longtime stylist Law Roach arrived in a mauve velvet jacket, purple tunic and a pair of Schiaparelli gold toed shoes, while designer and New York Fashion Week staple Prabal Gurung wore a rose-colored sherwani and aviator sunglasses. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, who skipped the red carpet entirely, were seen on social media dressed in gold and red saris respectively. Kim\u2019s ensemble featured an off-the-shoulder tasseled bodice, whereas Khlo\u00e9 opted for long, ornate sleeves, stacked necklaces and an opulent maang tikka. In an Instagram story, Kim teased that their film crew was in tow for an episode of their show \u201cThe Kardashians.\u201d Once inside the venue, which was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, celebrities including Chopra and Cena were seen dancing and letting loose. Footage widely shared on social media also showed members of the Ambani family dancing on stage with Indian singer, Daler Mehndi. The night\u2019s other performers included Afrobeats star Rema, who performed his hit song \u201cCalm Down.\u201d As for the couple itself, the groom first arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers, which he later changed for the ceremony. The bride dazzled in hand-embroidered bridal couture by the Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Merchant followed the Gujarati tradition of wearing red and white in an opulent red-trimmed ivory ensemble. It featured a 16-foot-long veil adorned with stones and sequins and a long ghagra, or traditional skirt, with a nearly seven-foot-long detachable train, according to her stylist Rhea Kapoor, who shared a first look on Instagram. Ahead of her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their\u00a0relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family, Merchant changed into an\u00a0opulent red and gold outfit\u00a0featuring a woven blouse, lehenga, veil and embroidered\u00a0head covering. In a video posted to social media on Friday morning, Anant\u2019s mother Nita Ambani recounted a recent trip to Varanasi, in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state, where she sought blessings for the pair. She said she hoped to \u201creimagine and present the purity, positivity and beauty of Varanasi at the wedding,\u201d adding that the event would \u201cpay a tribute to India\u2019s glorious culture and heritage, brought to life by thousands of artisans\u2026 weavers and craftspeople.\u201d It was also revealed that the gown Nita Ambani wore on the event red carpet took more than 40 days to create. The custom peach silk ghagra was designed by couture house Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and artisans Vijay Kumar and Monika Maurya. A lavish affair The Ambani family has remained tight-lipped about proceedings in the build-up to Friday\u2019s wedding, though rumors about the guest list and the identity of star performers have swirled in recent weeks. Local press and Indian social media users have also pored over speculation over everything from the dinner menu to the items of jewelry that might be on display from the family\u2019s sizable collection. One of India\u2019s best-known fashion designers, Manish Malhotra, served as the event\u2019s creative director. The celebrated couturier produced bespoke outfits for various members of the Ambani family throughout the month-long wedding celebrations. \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event \u2026 is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he told CNN via e-mail ahead of the wedding. In the days leading up to Friday\u2019s ceremony, the couple took part in several traditional pre-wedding rituals. Justin Bieber performed at the pair\u2019s \u201csangeet,\u201d a night of music and dance, last Friday. The couple then attended a private \u201chaldi\u201d ceremony, which traditionally sees friends and family bless the bride and groom by applying a turmeric paste to their heads, faces or bodies. As per Hindu tradition, the wedding dates were reportedly chosen according to auspicious days on the bride and groom\u2019s birth charts. A Brown University graduate, 29-year-old Anant Ambani is Mukesh\u2019s youngest child and serves as director at an energy business operated by Reliance. His bride Radhika Merchant, also 29, is the daughter of Viren and Shaila Merchant, the founders of pharmaceutical company Encore Healthcare. It is not known precisely how much money the Ambani family has spent on the pair\u2019s wedding celebrations. Industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars, with musical performers reported to be receiving seven- or even eight-figure sums. On the streets of Mumbai, residents spoken to by Reuters had mixed feelings about the extravagant event \u2014 and the wealth on display. \u201cIt\u2019s their wealth but it is beyond ridiculous what they are doing,\u201d said preschool teacher Devanshi Zaveri, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to show off that much.\u201d Banker Jenica Kothari meanwhile welcomed the boost to local businesses: \u201cIt\u2019s helping the economy, it\u2019s helping everyone\u2026 So, I think if they have the money, they should spend it.\u201d Local hotel rates reportedly soared as the thousands of guests prepared to jet to Mumbai, a financial hub that serves as India\u2019s commercial capital. Months of celebrations Festivities are set to continue through the weekend at the Ambani family\u2019s soaring 27-story Mumbai residence, Antilia. Saturday is expected to see a \u201cShubh Ashirwad,\u201d or divine blessings ceremony, while a Sunday reception (with an \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code) will give guests a final chance to celebrate with the couple. The weekend schedule concludes seven months of build-up to what has been described as India\u2019s wedding of year. Celebrations kicked off with a celebrity-filled engagement party in January. Two months later, the Ambanis hosted a communal dinner for more than 50,000 villagers and a 1,200-guest pre-wedding bash \u2014 attended by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump \u2014 featuring a rare live performance by Rihanna.

{"id": "2024_07_13_weather_beryl-houston-texas-power-outages-heat-saturday", "text": "Hundreds of thousands of southeast Texas residents are entering the sixth day in a row suffering brutal heat without air conditioning and many are scrambling to find cool shelters, food, safe drinking water and health care resources. More than 760,000 power customers in southeast Texas remain without power after Hurricane Beryl slammed the Gulf Coast Monday, leaving at least 10 people dead in Texas, two dead in Vermont and one dead in Louisiana. Hospitals, assisted living facilities, schools and water treatment plants are scraping for resources after the outages debilitated infrastructure across the region. That has led to mounting frustrations from residents that Houston\u2019s main utility provider \u2013 CenterPoint Energy \u2013 was not more prepared for the storm and renewed concerns over the state\u2019s power grid. Pregnant Houston resident Jordyn Rush, 32, worries for her health as the intense heat deprives her of sleep and her fridge sits empty while the outage drags on, making life difficult as she prepares to undergo a C-section in 12 days. \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute nightmare,\u201d Rush said. \u201cI\u2019m on the verge of like a mental breakdown. At this point, I can\u2019t tell you the last time I was able to get a full night of sleep because it\u2019s so hot. The lack of sleep is definitely wearing on me.\u201d CenterPoint Energy says it\u2019s hoping to restore power to an additional 350,000 customers by Sunday, according to a statement Friday evening. Still, half a million Houston-area homes and businesses may not have their power restored until next week, the utility company said, even as triple digit heat indices remain in the forecast. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick criticized the utility in a post Friday, saying \u201cwe should not have roughly a million homes and businesses without power this far out.\u201d \u201cWe should not have had almost every traffic light down through yesterday, with many still down. We should not have had nine fire stations without power,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cSeniors in assisted living and nursing homes should have been more of a priority for power restoration.\u201d Since Beryl pounded the region, heat advisories have been issued every day for the greater Houston area, with high temperatures in the 90s and triple-digit heat indices. Combined with power outages, alarmingly dangerous consequences have ensued. As residents desperately try to cool their homes with generators, carbon monoxide poisoning has become a serious concern. In Fort Bend County, a neighboring suburb to Houston, more than 41 people suffered carbon monoxide poisoning, Judge KP George said at a news conference Friday. In Harris County, at least two people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning and fire departments received more than 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls in 24 hours, local officials said. The US Department of Health and Human Services on Friday declared a public health emergency for Texas. \u201cThe combination of severe heat and limited access to electricity is dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations and those relying on electricity-dependent durable medical equipment and certain healthcare services,\u201d said Dawn O\u2019Connell, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, in a news release. Senior care facilities and residents who rely on electric medical devices are particularly at risk. A 71-year-old woman woman died near Crystal Beach after her oxygen machine ran out of battery power and her generator shut down. CrowdSource Rescue, a nonprofit primarily serving as a search-and-rescue group, identified roughly 120 senior living facilities that need assistance and helped deliver generators and supplies to 16 so far. A dozen Houston area hospitals are in a state of \u201cinternal disaster\u201d and more than 40 dialysis clinics are struggling with outages, Texas Emergency Management Chief\u00a0Nim\u00a0Kidd said in a news conference Thursday. Backed up hospitals prompted city officials to organize overflow beds in an indoor sports stadium, Lt. Gov. Patrick said Tuesday. In addition to health care facilities feeling the strain, residents at home are struggling to find food and water. Countless families have lost food in their warming fridges as many stores are shuttered, leaving government offices, food banks and other public services scrambling to distribute food to underserved areas. Scores of homes are also without drinking water as storm damage and power outages have left 135 wastewater treatment plants offline, according to Kidd. For Rush, who has gestational diabetes, it\u2019s been difficult to stay on the strict diet she needs to be on. \u201cI have to go in next week to do a pre-anesthesia lab draw and I\u2019m hoping that my labs aren\u2019t crazy from like a lack of nutrition and water,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart burn is out of control. I feel like I\u2019m getting dehydrated.\u201d Beryl swept through the Houston area in an unusually early start to hurricane season, knocking out power for more than 2 million customers, only about two months after a powerful derecho in the area damaged skyscrapers, downed transmission towers and left downtown dark. The Federal Emergency Management Agency granted Harris County and 14 other Texas counties financial assistance for impacted families as they face substantial repairs for homes damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Beryl. In the meantime, officials are racing to find ways to help residents beat the sweltering heat. Galveston, located south\u00a0of\u00a0Houston, is using transit buses to give some residents an \u201cair conditioned respite\u201d as portions of the city remain without power after Hurricane Beryl, according to City Manager Brian Maxwell. The city has also been distributing ice and providing portable showers. In Fort Bend County, emergency medical services is providing oxygen refills, electricity to power oxygen concentrators and rides to cooling centers. Frustration mounts with Houston utility provider The crisis comes more than three years after massive power outages hit the state. In February 2021, a deep freeze killed more than 200 people and left millions of customers without power and heat for days. Now, the ongoing outages have turned attention back to the state\u2019s power grid. Gov. Greg Abbott has requested an investigation into CenterPoint Energy and other electric companies in the wake of the outages, Patrick said at a news conference Thursday. Patrick on Friday criticized CenterPoint Energy\u2019s communication with customers and said they should have been ready for any storm hitting the Houston area. \u201cPeople have a right to be extremely frustrated with CenterPoint. People are suffering through terribly oppressive heat, a lack of food and gasoline availability, debris everywhere, and much more,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe poor and most vulnerable are suffering the most.\u201d CenterPoint in a statement Friday said it had been tracking Beryl\u2019s trajectory and preparing for its impact nine days before it made landfall. The company said it had increased crew members from 3,000 to 12,000 in response to the storm. CenterPoint CEO Jason Wells told the Houston Chronicle he is proud of the progress the company has made toward restoration but acknowledged customers\u2019 frustrations about not knowing when they will have power again. \u201cI think we could do a better job of communicating expectations with our customers, and I personally own that,\u201d Wells said. During a news conference Thursday, Patrick was asked by a reporter whether the state is considering modifying the power grid, which\u00a0has encountered several issues over the years\u00a0due to severe weather. \u201cThe grid is a whole different issue which we\u2019re addressing, have been addressing, and will continue to address,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe power is down because the lines are down, and the transmission lines are down primarily because trees fell on them.\u201d Displacement brings back memories Houston resident Destinee Rideaux, 33, is displaced for the second time after a hurricane \u2013 and this time it\u2019s because her home is too hot to live in. Because her apartment gets as hot as 96 degrees during the day, she\u2019s been forced to stay at different friends\u2019 apartments each night and carry around her belongings in her car. And Rideaux says she\u2019s \u201cexhausted.\u201d It brings back her memories of being displaced from her home in Iowa, Louisiana, during Hurricane Laura in 2020, she said. \u201cWe evacuated the day she hit. The next morning, we were able to get footage of the home and it was flattened. It was picked up and thrown across the yard and flattened. And everything we had was thrown across the yard,\u201d she told CNN. For Rush, the crisis is a repeat of the derecho in May, when her home didn\u2019t have power for six days. \ufeff\u201cWe had to clear our fridge completely for the second time in less than two months. It\u2019s our second time in less than two months of being displaced from our home,\u201d Rush said. \u201cWe are left without any communication or updates, so we have no idea what kind of plans we need to make or if we need to make preparations to find a hotel because most of the hotels here are completely booked.\u201d After Rideaux\u2019s Louisiana house was destroyed, she stayed with friends in the Houston area, and then decided to stay there permanently for a fresh start. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to be back in this position of just displacement,\u201d Rideaux\u00a0said. \u201cDuring Laura, every day I didn\u2019t know what that day would bring, where I was going to go. You also have the mental thing going on of like becoming a burden on other people.\u201d But Rideaux said this time isn\u2019t nearly as difficult because she\u2019ll be able to return to her home eventually. \u201cOnce the power comes back on, I have a home to go to,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/weather/beryl-houston-texas-power-outages-heat-saturday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Microsoft took a\u00a0non-voting, observer position\u00a0on OpenAI\u2019s board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company, which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. The seat meant it could attend OpenAI\u2019s board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors. The observer seat and Microsoft\u2019s more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the US over how much control it exerts over OpenAI. Microsoft cited OpenAI\u2019s new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman\u2019s return to the startup for giving up its observer seat. \u201cOver the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction.

EU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc\u2019s merger rules\u00a0because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement. In contrast, the\u00a0British\u00a0and US antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft\u2019s influence over OpenAI and the latter\u2019s independence.

{"id": "2024_07_09_europe_yulia-navalnaya-arrest-order-russia-intl", "text": "A court in Moscow has ordered Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, to be arrested in absentia, her spokesperson said Tuesday. The Basmanny District Court in Moscow accused Navalnaya, who now lives outside Russia, of \u201cparticipation in an extremist organization,\u201d her spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said in a post on social media. She has also been added to an international wanted list, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. In addition, the court granted a request by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation to detain Navalnaya. The period of detention would be calculated from the moment of possible extradition to Russian territory or from her detention on Russian territory, according to a press release. Navalnaya does not live in Russia. Alexey Navalny died on February 16 in the penal colony in Siberia where he was serving a 19-year sentence after being found guilty of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes in August. He was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges he had always denied and claimed were politically motivated. Navalny was Russia\u2019s highest-profile opposition leader and spent years criticizing Putin, who has been in power for nearly a quarter of a century, at great personal risk. His death came weeks before the country\u2019s\u00a0presidential elections\u00a0scheduled to begin nationwide on March 15, which is widely seen by the international community as little more than a formality that will secure Putin a fifth term in power. \u2018Putin is a murderer\u2019 Navalny\u2019s death was met with grief and anger across the world as well as inside Russia, where the smallest acts of political dissent carry huge risks. He returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated after being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. On arrival Navalny was swiftly arrested \u2013 on charges he dismissed as politically motivated \u2013 and spent the rest of his life in prison. His wife, Yulia\u00a0Navalnaya, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin in February of being\u00a0responsible for his death\u00a0and indicated she would pick up her husband\u2019s mantle,\u00a0for a \u201chappy, beautiful Russia.\u201d Navalnaya posted an eight-minute video on her dead\u00a0husband\u2019s\u00a0social media outlets, saying Putin \u201ckilled the father of my children, Putin took away the most precious thing that was my closest and most beloved person.\u201d She said Russian authorities were \u201chiding\u201d Navalny\u2019s body in an attempt to disguise the cause of his death \u2013 \u201clying pathetically\u201d and waiting for \u201ctraces of another of Putin\u2019s Novichoks to disappear.\u201d The Kremlin rejected any allegations of involvement in\u00a0Navalny\u2019s death. Reacting to the court\u2019s decision on Tuesday, Navalnaya reiterated claims of Putin\u2019s involvement in the death of her husband. \u201cHis place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia \u2013 in the same colony and the same 2 by 3 meter cell in which he killed Alexey,\u201d she said in a social media post. \u201cOh, won\u2019t there be the usual procedure? A foreign agent, then the opening of a criminal case, then an arrest?! When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal.\u201d CNN\u2019s Anna Chernova, Nathan Hodge, Sahar Akbarzai and\u00a0Jack Guy contributed to this story.

{"id": "2024_07_11_europe_macron-france-mainstream-coalition-intl", "text": "Three days after the second round of France\u2019s snap parliamentary election ended in gridlock, President Emmanuel Macron broke his silence to urge mainstream parties to form a solid majority in the National Assembly and shut out the extremes. France\u2019s vote, which Macron unexpectedly called after his party was trounced by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party in last month\u2019s European elections, has tipped France into political limbo, after none of the three main blocs came close to forming an absolute majority. In an open letter to the French people published Wednesday, Macron called on parties with \u201crepublican values\u201d \u2013 understood to exclude parties on the far left and far right \u2013 to form a coalition large enough to pass laws in parliament. Macron\u2019s comments suggest he is unwilling to work with the more extreme part of the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition, which secured the most seats in the French parliament in Sunday\u2019s second-round vote, but not enough to govern independently. \u201cI call on all political forces that recognize themselves in republican institutions, the rule of law, parliamentarianism, a European orientation and the defense of French independence, to engage in sincere and loyal dialogue to build a solid majority, necessarily plural, for the country,\u201d wrote Macron. Macron said it was \u201cin light of these principles\u201d that he will decide on the appointment of France\u2019s next prime minister. \u201cThis means giving the political forces a little time to build these compromises with serenity and respect for each other,\u201d he said. The NFP won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group in the 577-seat parliament. Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which trailed in a distant third in the first round, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. And the RN and its allies, despite leading the first round, won 143 seats. It is customary for the French president to appoint a prime minister from the largest parliamentary group \u2013 in this case the NFP \u2013 and ask it to form a government. But Macron and his Ensemble allies have repeatedly refused to enter into coalition with the far-left France Unbowed, the largest single party within the NFP, and have accused its leader, the 72-year-old firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, of being just as extreme and unfit to govern as figures on the far right. The NFP formed days after Macron called the snap vote, and chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. After tactical voting and political bargaining between centrist and left-wing voters, the NFP managed the same feat in Sunday\u2019s second round. But the NFP does not speak with a single voice. The various parties in the coalition straddle vast ideological ground, from the far-left France Unbowed to the more moderate Place Publique and Socialist parties. When the shock result was announced, each party celebrated separately, and the bloc still has not nominated a leader to become prime minister. M\u00e9lenchon has stated his intention to govern France. In a victory speech Sunday evening near Stalingrad Square in Paris, he said Macron \u201chas the duty\u201d to ask the NFP to form a government. Unlike its neighbors Italy and Germany, France \u2013 with its presidential system \u2013 lacks the culture of coalition-building and compromise, meaning the formation of a new government could take weeks and prove fleeting. Newly-elected members of parliament, called \u201cdeputies,\u201d are scheduled to take their seats for the first time on July 18. But without a clear majority, a minority government faces the risk of no-confidence votes, which could lead to several governments replacing each other in quick succession. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal\u2019s offer to resign was on Monday rejected by Macron, leaving him in place in a caretaker role until the new government is formed. \u201cThe current government will continue to exercise its responsibilities, then take care of day-to-day business in accordance with republican tradition,\u201d Macron said, in an attempt to calm the situation two weeks out from the Olympic Games\u2019 opening ceremony in Paris.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/europe/macron-france-mainstream-coalition-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The \u201cextremely aggressive inferno\u201d was deemed fully under control earlier this week, but weather conditions shifted Friday, setting the stage for rapid fire spread, Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador Andrew Furey said in a Facebook update Saturday.

{"id": "2024_07_14_americas_venezuela-migrants-maduro-biden-intl-latam", "text": "A small corner of Venezuela is spreading slowly along 77th\u00a0Street in Bogota, the capital of Colombia. Municipal maps formally refer to that neighborhood as\u00a0Unir II (\u201cunite\u201d), but to many of its inhabitants it is known as Barrio Hugo Chavez, after the late Venezuelan president. Many of the more than seven million Venezuelans who fled their country over the past decade or more now call Bogota home. The city is brimming with informal communities where migrants come together to help each other integrate and combat the ever-present melancholy and homesickness. Maria Alvarez is one such migrant. A 27-year-old single mother from Valencia, Alvarez left Venezuela in 2017 when her son Gabriel was only one. They haven\u2019t returned since. Gabriel knows his grandparents only from the photos on his mother\u2019s phone and the occasional video call. \u201cEveryone left\u2026 I\u2019ve got family in Brazil, the US, here in Colombia, in Ecuador, in Chile too. We are all abroad: uncles, aunts, cousins\u2026 only my mom and my dad, and one of my brothers remain in Venezuela,\u201d Alvarez told CNN. Most of those seven million migrants left Venezuela after 2014, according to the United Nations, amid an economic and political crisis brought about by a crash in the price of oil \u2013 a key export for Venezuela \u2013 combined with chronic corruption and mismanagement at the hands of government officials. Almost two million of them have been granted work permits to work in Colombia, where life is working out well for Alvarez and many others like her. After the Covid pandemic, she helped create a foundation in\u00a0Unir II\u00a0to provide Venezuelans and Colombians with professional classes and psychological counseling. She now makes a living as a manicurist and has met a new partner. Even so, she still feels the draw of Venezuela. \u201cI just dream of going home and building a life there. Colombia has been good, I feel welcome here, but well, I long to go back,\u201d she told CNN, tearfully. An election and a credible opposition But with the authoritarian government of Nicolas Maduro firmly ensconced in power, for many years those dreams of returning have remained just that. Until now. This month, for the first time in a decade, Venezuela will hold an election in which Maduro\u2019s government is being challenged by an opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, who has a credible chance of winning. In October last year, Maduro formally pledged to grant free and fair elections in 2024 at the end of a long and secretive negotiation process with the US State Department. That pledge was at least partially compromised amid a new spat between Washington and Caracas: the leading opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, was barred from running earlier this year, as was her immediate replacement Corina Yoris. The Venezuelan government has accused the White House of not lifting all economic sanctions against government officials, and in recent weeks opposition supporters and members of Machado\u2019s team have been detained. Even so, many experts believe that come the July 28 election the opposition has a real chance of pushing Maduro out of power. Recent polls put Gonzalez more than twenty percentage points ahead of Maduro and, for the first time in years, electoral observers from the Carter Center and the UN have been invited to monitor the election. Such a lead would make Gonzalez the heavy favorite if this were almost any other democratic country. Yet in Venezuela, the government has a habit of clinging to power. Critics have long accused it of rigging votes and silencing the opposition. Opposition protests were repeatedly repressed in 2014, 2017 and 2019, and hundreds of opposition leaders have been arrested, or exiled. Still, to many, this year feels different. \u201cI personally find it difficult to believe Maduro will just give up power,\u201d said Laura Dib, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America. \u201cHowever, you know, if there\u2019s massive participation with international observation and, of course, with pressure from inside the government itself and international pressure\u2026 that could create some avenues,\u201d she told CNN. Alvarez and many other migrants in Bogota, think similarly: \u201cMaduro can only win the election if he steals it. But if there\u2019s a new government, I\u2019d go back the same day. Not just me, hundreds, thousands\u2026 there won\u2019t be enough planes for everyone to return home,\u201d said Endel Gonzalez, a 54-year-old from Maracaibo who has worked as a food courier in Bogota for the past five years. What it means for America It\u2019s the fate of migrants like Alvarez and millions of others like her that are making this such a closely watched election. Before the pandemic, it was common for Venezuelan migrants to seek opportunities in neighboring countries, but in the past three years more than half a million have headed to the United States\u2019 southern border, moving directly via land from Colombia to Panama and Central America, all the way to Northern Mexico. Venezuelans were the second largest group of migrants apprehended by US Customs and Border Patrol in 2023, totaling over 260,000 encounters, a fivefold increase\u00a0from 2020\u00a0when there were less than 50,000,\u00a0putting pressure on the White House to stem the flow. With the Democratic administration facing an uncertain election in November and migration policies squarely on the ballot, this month\u2019s contest in Caracas could hold profound consequences for US President Joe Biden. Most experts who spoke to CNN believe that if Gonzalez wins, many migrants will decide to return to Venezuela \u2013 but if Maduro clings to power, even more will be tempted to head to the US border, both for political reasons and practical ones. In the early years of Venezuela\u2019s migration boom, many Latin American countries offered emergency permits and ad hoc policies for migrants from the country, but now many are erecting barriers to deter the free movement of people. Colombia for example has stopped issuing documents for recently arrived migrants, while the newly elected president of Panama, Jose Raul Mulino, has proposed fencing off the jungles that connect his country to Colombia. Dib estimates that up to two million more migrants could be on the move by next year. What next? The Biden administration has been instrumental in reaching this moment. Maduro\u2019s agreement to a free and fair election came only after the US partially lifted oil sanctions, and only after repatriation flights for undocumented migrants back to Caracas resumed in October. Direct negotiations between Maduro and the State Department seem to have halted, although Maduro announced last week that his chief negotiator, Jorge Rodriguez, held a meeting with US officials to resume talks. Washington is openly supporting Gonzalez, apparently reasoning that a transition to democracy in Venezuela would not only help negotiations around energy policy and migration, but also help turn Caracas from its ideological alliances with the likes of China, Russia and Iran. But with both countries going to the polls this year, it may be what voters decide in November, rather than July, that really makes the difference. \u201cIf the Biden administration remains in power, I believe (bilateral) negotiations will continue,\u201d Dib said. \u201cNow, if there\u2019s a Trump administration, most likely it\u2019s just conducting business\u2026 without much regard on what happens in terms of democracy and human rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/americas/venezuela-migrants-maduro-biden-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_12_style_dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon", "text": "Pristine, crisp and all-white \u2014 tennis whites have been a tradition dating back centuries. The distinctive look has not only made the racquet sport stand out, it has also become a sartorial mainstay off the courts, too. And even though most of the major tournaments have done away with the hueless uniformity, Wimbledon, the very first of them, has remained strict in its policy (as have many private clubs around the world). The prestigious championship even clamped down on the rule a decade ago, prohibiting colorful accents that had become increasingly common \u2014\u00a0 the year after Roger Federer\u2019s now-infamous pair of orange-soled sneakers were banned after his first round in 2013. The rules once called for \u201cpredominantly white\u201d outfits, allowing some competitors to play with color combinations, such as Serena Williams\u2019 tribute to Wimbledon treat strawberries and cream in 2010. But the crackdown changed the wording to \u201calmost entirely white,\u201d per the organizers: no off-white, no panels of color, no varying colorways on sneakers. The only recent loosening of rules was in 2023, to allow women to wear dark-colored shorts on the court following criticisms that the rules weren\u2019t accommodating for menstruation leaks. But why did tennis whites become the standard? The reasons often cited are practical ones, from heat reflection to sweat-masking. But senior curator Kevin Jones of the ASU Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (ASU FIDM) Museum in Los Angeles, who organized the recent traveling exhibition \u201cSporting Fashion: Outdoor Girls 1800 - 1960,\u201d said it really comes down to a long history of clubs enforcing social status, starting when lawn tennis skyrocketed in popularity in Victorian-era England as a leisure sport \u2014 and a rare one that allowed women, too. \u201cIt\u2019s completely elitist because white clothes are difficult to maintain,\u201d he said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cAnd the types of materials that these dresses were made of, which were cottons and linens, creased easily, so to keep them nice and freshly starched was also an aspect of that care.\u201d Challenging the rules Of course, tennis style has drastically changed in a century-and-a-half since it first became a recreational sensation for the upper class, hot off the heels of croquet (and utilizing the same neatly trimmed lawns). Early tennis attire was more akin to 19th-century leisurewear: women wore striped and patterned garments with long skirts, corseting and wide-brimmed hats; men donned wool pants, button-downs or sweaters. Because spectators and players have often adhered to similar styles, fashion and tennis have had a \u201cmutual exchange over time, where various tennis trends have seeped into wider culture as well,\u201d said sports journalist Ben Rothenberg, author of \u201cTennis: The Stylish Life\u201d as well as a recent biography on Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s been more than apparent in the past few months as Zendaya turned out a series of tennis-inspired high-fashion red-carpet looks matching the on- and off-court drama of the film \u201cChallengers,\u201d and recently faced Federer in an \u201cair tennis\u201d match for a campaign by the sportswear brand On. The close alignment with fashion has also led to the success of classic tennis-born labels such as Lacoste and Fred Perry, as well as radical new fashion innovations introduced on the court, like Elsa Schiaparelli dressing Spanish player Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez in culottes, a split skirt, for Wimbledon in 1931, to onlookers\u2019 shock. Like with De \u00c1lvarez, dress codes in tennis have often changed after an initial scandal. The French player Suzanne Lenglen was one of the earliest and most memorable cases, when she did away with layered, long dresses and wore a more airy calf-length skirt and shorter sleeves at Wimbledon in 1919. A muse to the designer Jean Patou, Lenglen became tennis\u2019 first fashion icon with her signature headscarf and then-provocative shorter hems. At the US, French and Australian Open, players have challenged definitions of what tennis clothes can be thanks to looser rules (subject to referee opinion). None have done so more than the Williams sisters, with Serena wearing a denim mini, tutus and cape-like silhouettes and Venus\u2019s lacy black-and-red ensemble that drew comparisons to lingerie. More recently, Serena Williams\u2019 Nike kit became the topic of conversation at the 2018 French Open when she opted for a black compression catsuit that didn\u2019t feature the compulsory tennis skirt. Though she cited its circulation benefits following a severe blood-clot scare with the birth of her child, the French Open said it would bar the style in the future. However, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association formally allowed it, and Williams continued to wear versions of the bodysuit at the 2019 and 2021 Australian Opens, normalizing the agile and simplified cut for the tennis court. \u201cI love wearing skirts,\u201d she told CNN in April while reflecting on the controversy. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure that my blood was always circulating and I had been in a near-death experience.\u201d \u201cSo I think there should have been\u2026 understanding around that whole outfit,\u201d she added. Brand distinctions Most of the Grand Slam tournaments dropped the all-white rules decades ago, likely in a bid to attract more television viewers and advertisers in an age of increased visibility for the sport. \u201cColor is vital to draw the eye and especially for those sports companies to be able to advertise their logos and their colors,\u201d Jones explained. Sports and luxury brands advertise through fashion in multiple ways, from dressing star players in custom statement pieces to promoting merchandised designs on competitors. Wimbledon\u2019s restrictive rules have been \u201cfrustrating\u201d for brands trying to sell their tournament collections, Rothenberg said. When Fila introduced Bjorn Borg throwback shirts in 2001, replicating what the tennis star wore during his five-time-winning Wimbledon streak from 1976 to 1980, Wimbledon officials said they no longer adhered to the rules. The decision sent the sports brand \u201cscrambling\u201d to get new shirts to the players wearing them, Rothenberg explained. And, after Federer\u2019s orange-soled shoes were banned, Nike had to act fast to spin their brief appearance, advertising them as \u201cOne Match Wonders\u201d in a print ad. For players, the smallest infractions have proved controversial, and some players have outright refused to play along, as Andre Agassi did from 1988-90 when he boycotted Wimbledon entirely. In 2017, Jurij Rodionov was told to change blue underwear that was peeking out of his shirts, while Sabine Lisicki recently said that she and women were often required to switch out their skin-colored bras. But Rothenberg doesn\u2019t see more leniency happening anytime soon from Wimbledon\u2019s decision-makers. \u201cI think Wimbledon sees its anachronisms as a big part of its brand and its value,\u201d he explained. \u201cWimbledon has clung on to it as a way to be distinct and different \u2014 and I think it\u2019s largely been successful. It doesn\u2019t look like any other tournament.\u201d There have been criticisms levied against the major tournaments whenever women players seem to be disproportionately affected by their dress codes, and though Rothenberg agrees, he also points out that women\u2019s styles have been more creative. Men\u2019s tenniswear has deviated less from shorts and lightwear polos or shortsleeve athletic shirts since they were introduced. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of men\u2019s short length getting markedly shorter over the last 12 months though, especially players who really have hiked up their shorts a lot,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe someday there will be rules against that if they start showing too much cheek.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled a source\u2019s surname and misstated the current name of the ASU FIDM Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_15_style_ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian", "text": "India\u2019s most anticipated wedding of the year came to an end on Sunday after a star-studded three-day celebration that even saw the country\u2019s prime minister arrive to bless the young couple. Billionaire heir Anant Ambani married his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant in Mumbai in a lavish ceremony attended by Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, two former British prime ministers, Indian sporting legends and some of Bollywood\u2019s most famous faces. The wedding was followed by a blessing ceremony on Saturday, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi bestowed the young couple and their families with well wishes. The weekend\u2019s festivities concluded Sunday with an extravagant reception, or \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d (festival of bliss), as attendees jetted out of Mumbai. No expense was spared by the family that owns India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. The Ambani-owned 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Centre, which hosted wedding events throughout the weekend, was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, featuring floral installations and extravagant sets embellished with gold and silver. The couple underwent multiple outfit changes across the three-day bash, appearing in a succession of intricate, custom-made pieces celebrating the country\u2019s heritage and culture. Merchant\u2019s bridal ensemble was designed by Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and featured ivory zardozi (an elaborate type of metal embroidery) on silk and a 5-meter (16.4-foot) veil. She completed the look with jewels that aunts and sister wore to their own weddings. She later changed into an opulent red and gold outfit for her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family. Ambani meanwhile arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers. For the marriage ceremony, he wore a custom red sherwani by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, with a large green necklace draped around his neck. For Saturday\u2019s blessings ceremony, Merchant once again donned a custom piece by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, who collaborated with contemporary artist and sculptor Jayasri Burman to create a one-of-a-kind piece embroidered with real gold. The garment celebrates the couple\u2019s union \u201cthrough deeply meaningful imagery,\u201d Merchant\u2019s stylist Rhea Kapoor wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe human figures representing the happy couple radiate a celestial aura that honors the divinity in their humanity. The fauna depicts Anant\u2019s fondness for animals, particularly elephants that are considered auspicious and beautiful.\u201d For the reception Sunday, guests interpreted the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code by mixing classic Indian fashion with contemporary styles. Merchant wore a gold metallic corset from Dolce and Gabbana\u2019s Alta Moda couture line, along with a skirt and dupatta in the same shade by Indian designer Anamika Khanna.  Months of planning It is not known precisely how much the Ambanis spent on the celebrations, which included months of pre-wedding parties, though industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Insiders worked for months to bring the couple\u2019s vision to life, collaborating with the family to bring the intricate details \u2014 from the floral arrangements to the set designs \u2014 together. Renowned wedding designer Preston Bailey, who has worked with Serena Williams and LeBron James, was commissioned to create larger-than-life floral art installations for the weekend. Speaking to CNN via email ahead of Friday\u2019s ceremony, Bailey commended Ambani\u2019s mother Nita\u2019s attention to detail. It was \u201cnothing short of pure genius and she is really focused on bringing the vast creative talent of India to the world through these weddings,\u201d he said. The inspiration for Bailey\u2019s designs came from the couple\u2019s love for animals and Ambani\u2019s recently opened animal sanctuary, Vantara, in the western Indian city of Jamnagar. His sculptural creations included a giant display of hot air balloons and more than 60 floral animals, including giraffes, two huge toucans, monkeys perched on trees inside the venue and a giant horse made from red and pink flowers. \u201cI have been in business for over 40 years \u2026 (but) I have never seen anything as intricate as this wedding and I believe it will bring such positive feedback and awareness to the great creative culture of artists of India,\u201d said Bailey, who also worked on the weddings of Ambani\u2019s two older siblings, Akash and Isha. Top Indian couturier and the wedding\u2019s creative director, Manish Malhotra, earlier told CNN that \u201cmaintaining the essence of India\u201d had been his \u201cguiding principle.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet (a traditional evening of music and dance that saw a performance from Justin Bieber) to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he said via email. Criticism and sustainability Details of the celebrations dominated local news headlines and set social media abuzz, but many within India \u2014 the world\u2019s most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people \u2014 criticized the opulence on show in a country with a glaring wealth gap and where millions live in poverty. \u201cShame on people celebrating income inequality in a country where we need wealth redistribution,\u201d tweeted comedian and social media critic, Shamita Yadav, who posts on social media as The Ranting Gola. \u201cWe are really a poor country,\u201d Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, Sushant Singh, told Indian news outlet The Wire. \u201cThis is something which is completely unacceptable. But the fact of the matter is half of India\u2019s big media is owned by Mr. Ambani, so it is unlikely that India\u2019s big media is going to say that this is horrible.\u201d Beyond the financial cost of the wedding and festivities is another, less visible cost: the one to the planet. An average Indian wedding of 300 people typically generates between 1.5 tons and 2 tons of waste, and around 30 to 40 tons of carbon emission \u2014 before taking guest travel into consideration \u2014 according to Ashwin Malwade, co-founder of Greenmyna, a Mumbai-based sustainable wedding consultancy. Sources of emissions include large-scale banquets and energy used by extravagant light displays. An event as huge in scale as the Ambani-Merchant celebration would emit far more carbon than even the largest and most lavish Indian wedding, he added. Then there\u2019s the travel, with several high-profile attendees pictured leaving Mumbai via Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport\u2019s private jet terminal. Malwade also pointed to the environmental footprint of the Ambanis\u2019 pre-wedding bash in Jamnagar, attended by public figures from around the world, including Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump, Bill Gates and Karlie Kloss; the four-day cruise arranged for guests in the Mediterranean; and the emissions required to fly in singers like Rihanna and Justin Bieber to perform at various events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/style/ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_sport_paris-olympics-seine-triathlon-bacteria-spiking-intl", "text": "Weeks before the Olympic Games are set to begin in Paris, the River Seine is still not safe for swimming on most days due to high levels of E. Coli bacteria in the water, according to official data. Official testing by the city of Paris shows E. Coli levels at Alexandre III Bridge, where the triathlon events are planned to start later this month, have been above acceptable levels on the majority of days \u2013 22 out of 30 \u2013 between June 3 and July 2, potentially exposing athletes to serious health risks. However, authorities say there has been a general improvement in the Seine\u2019s water quality as weather conditions have improved in recent weeks and are \u201cconfident for the Olympics now.\u201d \u201cWe are having weather that is more consistent with the season,\u201d Antoine Guillou, Deputy Mayor of Paris, told CNN Wednesday in a telephone interview. \u201cThe quality of the Seine is good.\u201d The mayor of Paris told French radio Wednesday that she would swim in the city\u2019s River\u00a0Seine\u00a0next week,\u00a0in a bid to show its suitability for the Olympics despite ongoing cleanliness concerns. Mayor Anne Hidalgo told France Inter radio that she would \u201cdive in next week\u201d and the water would be \u201cdepolluted, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. Coli levels to spike again. As recently as June 30, following rain the previous day, E. Coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge. That\u2019s double the level needed for \u201cgood\u201d water quality, as per World Triathlon standards. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides the race can go ahead. Earlier this week, Paris 2024 told CNN that it has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the work undertaken by the City of Paris. \u201cNevertheless, the potential for unseasonal weather events requires us to be cautious,\u201d they added. The opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics is set to take place on the\u00a0Seine\u00a0on July 26 if currents are not too strong. A recent rehearsal on June 24 was cancelled due to strong water flows caused by heavy rainfall. 10x acceptable level Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for more than 100 years due to the river\u2019s pollution levels, though some swimming has been permitted recently as part of triathlon test events. The individual triathlon races will begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race \u2013 passing by the Le Grand Palais and Champs-Elys\u00e9es \u2013 before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city. A mixed team relay race involving four athletes \u2013 two men and two women \u2013 will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run. Authorities have spent at least \u20ac1.4 billion ($1.55 billion) to clean up the Seine. One of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle the issue of pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024. The basin is now operational. Following rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 m3 of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris. But E. Coli levels near Alexandra III Bridge still climbed to around 10000 CFU/100mL on the second day of rain. That\u2019s around 10 times higher than World Triathlon\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d water quality level, according to CNN\u2019s calculation. \u201cIf there is a storm on one day, yes, you can see a deterioration of the quality due to that storm. But then it is possible to wait until the swimming conditions are back,\u201d Guillou said. Cautious optimism Concerns about the Seine\u2019s poor water quality have been bubbling away for a while now. \u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of rain in June, much more than usual. That explains why the quality of the Seine was above acceptable levels until late June,\u201d Guillou said. But some say the tide could be turning with the arrival of sunnier and drier weather conditions and new technology being deployed by the city of Paris. Technology company Fluidion, founded in Paris in 2012, has been testing the Seine\u2019s water near Alexandre III Bridge multiple times a week since early April. Longer term trends show there has been a \u201csignificant improvement\u201d in water quality, according to Dan Angelescu, the company\u2019s CEO. The Seine serves as Fluidion\u2019s primary research site, according to the company, hence why they routinely collect water samples for internal research efforts. CNN has not independently verified the organization\u2019s findings. Earlier this year, between early April and late May, E. Coli levels were just under 3400 MPN/100mL (an equivalent unit to CFU/100mL), according to Fluidion\u2019s testing. That\u2019s more than three times higher than the level needed for \u201cgood\u201d water quality, according to CNN\u2019s calculation. In comparison, between June 24 and July 5, average E. Coli levels dropped to around 880 MPN/100mL, according to Fluidion. But Angelescu said standard testing methods cannot accurately detect \u201caggregate-bound\u201d E. Coli bacteria that are clumped together in the water, potentially posing an \u201cunderreported health risk.\u201d Testing carried out using Fluidion\u2019s ALERT technology, which the company says can measure aggregate-bound E. Coli bacteria, shows E. Coli levels have decreased in recent weeks, but much less dramatically than standard testing indicates, Angelescu said. \u201cThis discrepancy raises important questions about the true safety of the water for swimming events and highlights the need for current regulations to evolve,\u201d he added. Paris 2024 shares the view that sunshine and higher temperatures have brought about a significant improvement in water quality, but they add that caution is still needed. \u201cThe potential for unseasonal weather events requires us to be cautious, which is why we have put in place a number of contingency plans including options for postponing the events,\u201d a Paris 2024 spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the \u201cfinal resort\u201d would be to downgrade the triathlon events to duathlons with no swimming. For the marathon swimming events, the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in Seine-et-Marne, where the canoe-kayak and rowing events are being held, could act as an alternative venue, they said. \u201cAs an organizing committee, our first priority and responsibility is to allow athletes who have been training for these Games for years, to complete their preparation for the competition with full peace of mind,\u201d the spokesperson said. Guillou added that a new 10-kilometre-long basin, located between Essonne and Val-de-Marne, is going to be made operational in the coming days, which like the Austerlitz basin will help to reduce pollution. \u201cWe are confident that with normal weather conditions there will not be any problem,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_13_middleeast_mawasi-deif-israel-hamas-gaza-intl", "text": "At least 90 Palestinians have been reported killed in an Israeli strike on a displacement camp in southern Gaza which Israel said targeted Hamas\u2019 military chief, who was an alleged mastermind of the October 7 attacks. Footage from Al-Mawasi, which has been designated as a safe zone for Palestinians fleeing the fighting elsewhere, shows bodies in the street and destroyed tents. A senior staffer at UNRWA, the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, described the Nasser hospital, which took in victims of the strike, as \u201cthe most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.\u201d \u201cI saw toddlers who are double amputees, children paralyzed and unable to receive treatment, and others separated from their parents.\u201d Mohammed Deif \u2013 the leader of Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019 military wing \u2013 was the figure targeted, alongside the head of the Khan Younis brigade, Rafe Salama, an Israeli security official told CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference in Tel Aviv Saturday that he was not certain whether Deif and his deputy had been killed, but said he had given his blessing for the head of Shin Bet \u2013 Israel\u2019s security agency \u2013 to carry out the operation after being assured there were no hostages in the area. The strike left scenes of devastation, with the Gaza Health Ministry reporting at least 90 people killed and 300 people injured. It said women and children accounted for half of those killed and dozens of those injured. CNN has no way of verifying the casualty numbers reported by the ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants killed. The Kuwait and Nasser Hospitals on the ground said they were struggling to cope with the high numbers of dead and injured civilians coming in, the ministry said. \u201cI was sitting in the bathroom, and before I heard explosions from the strike, the bathroom flew off,\u201d a young boy called Hammoud told a CNN stringer on the ground. \u201cThen, the whole area became filled with smoke, and then the shells began to fall.\u201d Hammoud\u2019s young brother was killed in the strike whilst his sister is currently in hospital receiving treatment for her injuries, his family told CNN. Another resident named Aida Hamdi told CNN: \u201cWe suddenly heard missiles hitting. I was baking bread, I took my daughter and we started running outside. \u201cI threw all the dough away, it was mixed with sand. We heard three hits, people around me were martyred, women, men, and children.\u201d Hamas denied Israeli claims it had targeted Deif and Salama, calling the killings a \u201chorrific massacre.\u201d \u201cThe occupation\u2019s claims of targeting leaders are false claims, and this is not the first time the occupation has claimed to target Palestinian leaders, only for its lies to be exposed later,\u201d a statement read. At least one US-made munition was used in the airstrike. In a video shared on social media, CNN identified the tail fin of a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), a Boeing-manufactured GPS-guided kit which can be added to so-called \u2018dumb bombs\u2019 to direct them at a specific target. Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, confirmed the identification of the JDAM tail at the scene for CNN. Similar CNN analysis has found US-made munitions were used in a strike on a school complex near Khan Younis and in other Israeli strikes on Gaza. A shadowy figure Israeli security and intelligence first received intelligence about a potential opportunity to strike Hamas\u2019 top military commander in recent days, but a clear window of opportunity to strike Deif only crystallized in the last 24 hours, an Israeli official said. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and top Shin Bet officials held multiple discussions overnight to assess the viability of a strike before the green light was given, the official said. A key focus of the discussions was assessing Israeli intelligence indicating that there were no hostages in the area, the official added, as well as the effect that carrying out such a significant strike might have on ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal negotiations. US officials said that Israel informed the United States that they had targeted senior Hamas officials in an airstrike Saturday but did not give advance warning of the operation. Little is known about Deif. Thought to have been born in the 1960s, Deif is a bomb maker was behind a wave of suicide attacks in 1996 that killed 65 people in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and other outrages intended to derail the peace process. His full name is Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, but he became known as El Deif (the Guest), because, for decades, he stayed in different houses every night to avoid being tracked, and killed, by Israel. Deif has been the target of Israeli assassination attempts before. A 2014 Israel strike killed his wife, seven-month-old son and three-year-old daughter. In May, the International Criminal Court said it was seeking arrest warrants for Deif and other senior Hamas figures, saying they had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe they bore responsibility for the October 7 attacks, which saw around 1,200 Israelis killed. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza - aimed at destroying Hamas and rescuing hostages still being held - has since killed more than 38,000 people. Pressure on ceasefire deal The strike comes at a delicate time in negotiations for a possible ceasefire and hostage release deal. While killing Deif would be seen as a major victory for Israel, it could encourage Hamas to harden its position on a three-phase Israeli proposal that was laid out by US President Joe Biden at the end of May. Talks to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages are ongoing. A Hamas political official denied reports on Sunday that Hamas is halting ceasefire negotiations due to Saturday\u2019s strike. Izzat Al-Rishq also called the strike an \u201cescalation\u201d and claimed one of the Israeli government\u2019s goals \u201cis to block the path to reaching an agreement that stops the aggression against our people.\u201d Meanwhile, at his press conference Saturday, Netanyahu insisted he would not move \u201cone millimeter\u201d from the framework laid out by Biden. He claimed Hamas had requested 29 changes to the proposal, but he refused to make even one. \u201cI\u2019m not adding conditions or removing conditions,\u201d he said. Hamas has not yet publicly commented on Netanyahu\u2019s claims. However, a diplomatic source involved in the negotiations said the ceasefire talks were still scheduled to take place in Doha, Qatar, next week despite the strike. In Israel on Saturday, protesters and families of hostages took to the streets of several cities to demand the government secure a deal to release all the hostages. In Jerusalem, masses outside the Knesset demanded the government accept the hostage release deal and bring everyone home now. Some protesters also gathered outside Netanyahu\u2019s office. In Tel Aviv, Andrey Kozlov, who was held hostage in Gaza for eight months before the Israeli military rescued him in June, addressed the crowd. \u201cI want to share that every day in Gaza was a living hell; every day felt like it could be my last on earth. Take it from me, every day matters, every minute, even every second,\u201d Kozlov said from the Hostage Square in Tel Aviv. \u201cI may look okay to you from the outside, but the pain weighs on me more than anyone can see, more than anyone can imagine,\u201d he added. \u201cI was one of the lucky ones since I wasn\u2019t held in a tunnel. So, I endured harsh conditions and abuse (but) what about the remaining 120 hostages?\u201d Kozlov said. Kozlov also urged Netanyahu to bring the rest of the hostages back home saying, \u201cPlease sign a deal!\u201d The Hostage and Missing Families Forum reminded Netanyahu there would be \u201cno victory\u201d before all the 120 hostages were brought home. The \u201cdeal is in the final stages before signing and returning the hostages home; it is time to instruct the negotiation teams to reach agreements and bring everyone home,\u201d\u00a0it said in a statement. \u201cWe have been waiting for them for 281 days.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_13_americas_avocado-cartel-us-mexico-intl-latam", "text": "When two US avocado inspectors were assaulted and detained at a police roadblock in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n last month, it sparked a costly international crisis. The US paused all avocado imports from the state for more than a week, leaving Mexican growers out of tens of millions of dollars and temporarily sending the price of a carton of the fruit in the US soaring by 40 percent, according to analysis firm RaboResearch Food & Agribusiness. Weeks later, after diplomats and agricultural officials from both countries negotiated new security guidelines around inspections, the massive cross-border trade has stabilized, with the US Department of Agriculture saying that export levels returned to normal at the beginning of July. But the episode underscored the precarious nature of the industry and the immense volatility in a region that provides most of the world\u2019s avocados, one of Mexico\u2019s most dangerous states and a nexus of cartel power. US and Mexican officials are now considering new changes to the strict processes that direct how the fruit can make its way to American kitchens to meet ever-increasing demand, with industry groups and advocates urging for more oversight. \u2018Green gold\u2019 Avocados, the creamy fruit with the industry nickname \u201cgreen gold,\u201d are big business. Of the amount exported from the nearly 2.7 million metric tons of the fruit grown last year in Mexico, 81 percent went to the US, at a value of $2.7 billion. Nearly three-quarters of Mexican avocados come from Michoac\u00e1n, a state along the country\u2019s Pacific coast with a volcanic belt running through it that makes its soil ideal for farming. The state\u2019s deepwater port has also been critical for the flourishing of drug cartels, which moved into Michoac\u00e1n in the 1980s, fueling a homicide rate that is today more than twice the national average. The expansion of the avocado market in the state around the same time has been \u201cdeeply intertwined\u201d with the violent groups and corrupt public authorities, researchers at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime said in a report this year. Citing interviews with growers in the state, the researchers described how criminal groups illegally burn and log protected forests and bribe local officials to change permissions around the use of the land to allow for commercial activity. According to an academic article published by the Mexican government cited in the report, 80 percent of the avocado orchards in Michoac\u00e1n were established illegally, \u201cinitially through unauthorized land use that was then turned into legal parcels thanks to corruption of public authorities.\u201d Cartels today also regularly extort producers in protection schemes, the report found. Local police forces in turn commonly rent themselves out as security for producers, and heavily armed militias known as \u201cautodefensa\u201d groups have formed to patrol farms. \u201cThis is the core of the mafia-style relationships that exist in Michoac\u00e1n around avocado production,\u201d Romain Le Cour, one of the report authors and a senior expert at the initiative, said in an interview. \u201cYou need criminal actors in a way to stir up the business, you need business entrepreneurs to run the business, and you need corrupt authorities to make sure that what you\u2019re doing becomes legalized or laundered.\u201d Mexican officials in the aftermath of the detention of the inspectors in June were quick to downplay the incident, claiming it was nonviolent and unrelated to organized crime and the inspectors\u2019 work in the avocado industry. The inspectors, who were Mexican citizens working for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, were stopped and taken from their car after attempting to cross a barricade on a highway set up by police officers who were protesting a pay issue, according to Alfredo Ram\u00edrez Bedolla, the Michoac\u00e1n governor. US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar has said, however, that the men were assaulted. The office of the Michoac\u00e1n state prosecutor told CNN last month that they\u2019ve opened an investigation into the incident. A dangerous job Since the US first allowed imports of avocados from Michoac\u00e1n in 1997, APHIS employees in the country have inspected avocado orchards to ensure they are free of pests that could harm US avocado crops. About 100 inspectors from the agency operate within the state, according to Ram\u00edrez, visiting avocado groves and packing facilities to check the fruit before issuing a certification. That close contact and pivotal responsibility leaves them \u201cextremely exposed to corruption and violence,\u201d said Le Cour, the GI-TOC expert. In 2022, exports of Mexican avocados were similarly halted for several days after one of the US inspectors working in Michoac\u00e1n received a threatening phone call. In the wake of both incidents, Mexican leaders have pushed to change the bilateral agreement regulating the trade to allow for the Mexican government to take over the inspections, with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador criticizing the US decision to halt the export as \u201carrogance.\u201d In a news conference last month, Mexican Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos said the Mexican government was \u201cperfectly prepared\u201d to do the work, which he said would be valuable to \u201cavoid having to stop the export.\u201d Officials at the US State Department and USDA have considered the possible change, according to Ken Melban, the vice president for industry affairs and operations at the California Avocado Commission, which represents growers in the state. In a statement, Melban called it \u201cunimaginable the US government would consider abdicating inspection responsibilities to Mexico.\u201d Such a change, he told CNN, would leave him doubtful of the integrity of certifications that the exported avocados are actually pest-free. \u201cUS farmers will not be protected under such a program, one intended and designed specifically to protect US farmers\u2019 economic interests,\u201d he said. An APHIS spokesperson declined to comment on the thinking around the policy. US and Mexican officials have also recently resurfaced discussions around a policy to block the export of avocados from Mexico grown in orchards on illegally cleared lands, according to Brad Adams, the executive director of Climate Rights International, an advocacy group that used satellite imagery last year to document the widespread deforestation behind the market. Leaders in both countries have voiced support for such a policy, but have so far been unable to decide on a legal mechanism to enact it. In a letter this spring to a group of US senators who had pushed for the change, the USDA noted that its inspectors don\u2019t have the regulatory authority to certify around the issue, according to a copy obtained by CNN. Instead, the agency pointed towards training and technical assistance that the US Forest Service has provided to Mexico \u201cto support real-time deforestation monitoring of priority regions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve exposed something that is illegal and therefore indefensible,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey have an obligation that they recognize at a governmental level in Mexico, and the US can\u2019t keep importing illegally harvested produce.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/americas/avocado-cartel-us-mexico-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_india_india-godmen-crowd-crush-bhole-baba-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "The devotees rushed to collect soil from the ground the man had just walked on, thousands thronging to the front of a venue densely crammed with a quarter of a million people, under stifling heat. But one by one, many began falling onto the muddy field and into a sewer nearby, crushing each other as panicked screams pierced the air. They had arrived to receive spiritual enlightenment, but 121 people \u2013 mostly women \u2013 were killed by the crowd crush in northern India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state last week. Those who survived were left scarred and traumatized. The man they had come to see was known to his disciples as Bhole Baba, a self-styled Hindu spiritual leader worshipped by many as a living god. And he is among dozens of spiritual gurus in the country who inspire devotion in millions of followers, have the ear of the Indian elite, and rake in colossal sums of money. While the world\u2019s most populous nation has long produced self-styled \u201cgodmen\u201d, the tradition has, over the last few decades, evolved into a multimillion-dollar industry, whose biggest stars control vast philanthropic and business empires. A large chunk of their money comes from their followers\u2019 donations. They are widely revered in a country where religion and faith dictate much of society \u2013 with some even winning endorsement from the highest echelons of society. But that industry occasionally finds itself mired in controversy, with several holy men either convicted or accused of a range of crimes \u2013 from financial fraud to murder and rape \u2013 alarming those who cast doubt on their divine personas. \u201cIt\u2019s a question we\u2019ve long asked,\u201d said Meera Nanda, author of \u201cThe God Market: How Globalization is Making India More Hindu.\u201d \u201cWhat brings literally millions of poor, desperate people to these godmen?\u201d A sense of belonging Subhash Lal was working as a security guard nearly 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Mughal Garhi village, where Bhole Baba was delivering his sermon, when the news flashed across his TV screen. Lal\u2019s mother, a devout follower of the guru, was among the crowd, and he was desperate for answers. Lal and his family rushed to the hospital that was treating the survivors, when his son learned of the devastating news. \u201cHe told me, Dad, your mother is no more,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cMy mother believed in (Bhole Baba). I couldn\u2019t tell her anything. She would attend these functions\u2026 she believed in him. What could I do?\u201d People like Lal\u2019s mother \u2013 poor and on the lower rungs of India\u2019s hierarchical caste system \u2013 make up the bulk of Bhole Baba\u2019s following. They are predominantly Dalit women from India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, where religion holds particular sway. And for them, a sense of devotion to these godmen is a way to be seen and heard within the Hindu religion. Despite being outlawed in 1950, the caste system, which categorizes Hindus at birth and once forced the so-called \u201cuntouchables\u201d or Dalits to the margins of society, is still omnipresent in the daily lives of millions across the nation. Policeman turned preacher Reportedly born Narayan Sakar to a low-caste family, Bhole Baba used to be a constable with the Uttar Pradesh Police before becoming a preacher and establishing an ashram \u2013 or place of worship \u2013 in the state. Sitting on an ornately decorated chair, he often delivers impassioned sermons exhorting his followers to maintain their devotion. \u201cIf, through the medium of truth, you remove old trash from within you, and today if you let truth into your heart, devotion for the god into your heart, humanity into your heart\u2026 then know that even if the world abuses you, you will not get affected by it at all,\u201d he can be heard saying in one of his speeches. The \u201crigidity of caste structure\u201d is an important reason for the proliferation of godmen, said K. Kalyani, an assistant professor of Sociology at Azim Premji University, Bangalore. \u201cThe low-caste community are particularly debarred within Hindu religion to have respectable position within religious institutions,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir presence in the sanctum sanctorum as priest or their proximity to deity is seen as an act of defilement due to practices of \u2018untouchability\u2019.\u201d In the absence of religious and spiritual gratification for low-caste Hindus, Kalyani said, an \u201calternative form of religiosity becomes inevitable.\u201d Sheetal Jatav, a survivor of last week\u2019s Bhole Baba event, said her community \u2013 the lower-caste Jatavs \u2013 \u201cbelieve in him immensely,\u201d hanging his pictures on their walls or even placing it inside small temples at home. Jatav said she was previously unable to get pregnant but conceived within two months of visiting Bole Baba\u2019s ashram. \u201cThere are many similar stories like this here,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cHe speaks of good things and wants all of us to do good deeds. We go there and feel peace.\u201d Miracle workers The gurus India has produced range from men who claim they can perform miracles, like the revered Sathya Sai Baba, to the yoga guru and founder of the widely popular Art of Living foundation, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Claiming to possess mystical knowledge and the ability to cure illness and solve problems, godmen inspire remarkable fervor in their millions of followers. But with their rise has come a slew of criticism over the true intentions behind this perceived divinity, fueled in recent decades by their grandiose lifestyles and immense wealth. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of the spiritual organization Dera Sacha Sauda, is another self-styled spiritual guru revered by millions. His group has ashrams across 10 states and union territories in India and claims to have 60 million followers worldwide. He is also a convicted killer and rapist. In 2017 he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for raping two of his followers. Two years later, he received a life term for the murder of a journalist who exposed the sexual abuse of women within his group. Despite the severity of his crimes, Singh maintains a cult-like following. The rape conviction even sparked riots by his supporters that left 36 people dead and hundreds injured across northern India. Since then, Singh has been granted parole multiple times, once even walking out of prison to attend his own birthday party, raising allegations of impunity for these holy men. \u201cThey have deep connections with the political machine\u2026 and it\u2019s deeply problematic,\u201d Nanda, the author, said. The furor over Singh\u2019s case was reminiscent of violent skirmishes that broke out in 2013 after the arrest of guru Asaram Bapu for raping a 16-year-old girl. He was convicted five years later and given a life sentence for the crime. Famous followers Many godmen are also known for their philanthropy, praised for building schools for the impoverished and developing infrastructure in small villages \u2013 and they also attract millions of people to small towns across the country. Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s followers, for example, included the US actor Goldie Hawn and Hard Rock Cafe founder Isaac Tigrett. When the guru died in 2011, Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar openly wept at his funeral, which was also attended by India\u2019s prime minister at the time, Manmohan Singh. More often than not, the most devout of their followers come from the lower middle classes, but millions in donations also stream in from foreigners, Indians living abroad, and the richest of society. While Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s appeal was \u2013 in large part \u2013 due to a certain level of mystique, other godmen, including Singh, are more outspoken, carefully using the media to fuel their rise. \u201cThere is an entire media structure that supports and promotes them,\u201d said Kalyani, the sociologist. \u201cThere are dedicated channels like Astha or Sanskar TV which have dedicated time to show their preachings.\u201d As authorities investigate the organizers of last week\u2019s event for alleged negligence, Bhole Baba, who left the event in an armored vehicle, is not being pursued by authorities. Many of those affected by the tragedy are angry. \u201cThis is not a real (godman),\u201d said Surendra Singh, whose wife was a devout follower of the guru, and died in the tragic crowd crush. Speaking to India\u2019s largest news agency, ANI, Bhole Baba, appearing forlorn, said: \u201cThis incident has left me distraught.\u201d \u201cMischief makers and anti-social elements responsible for the stampede will not be spared.\u201d Referring to himself by his birth name, he added: \u201cMay the praise of Narayan Sakar Hari resound forever throughout the universe.\u201d Aishwarya S.

Civilians who did nothing wrong.\u201d The\u00a0man echoed what many in Gaza have said in recent days amid instructions from the Israeli military for civilians to leave certain zones in central and southern Gaza, saying:\u00a0\u201cWe are displaced and we will stay here. If he wants to hit more, let him hit. We are staying, even if he wants to destroy all of Gaza and build a new one and call it Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza, we are staying.\u201d Abdul\u00a0Kareem Al Assas, a resident of Nuseirat, voiced his despair.\u00a0\u201cWhere should we go? You tell us where to go and we will. This is genocide. Why are the Arab countries silent? Don\u2019t give us food and water; we need safety\u2026 Are there resistance fighters here? There are only women, children, and elderly.\u201d Tayseer Al Kilani, whose family was also taking refuge at the school, said: \u201cWe all ran away. Then my son came carrying my grandson, who was injured and taken to Al Aqsa hospital. Then another missile hit. Netanyahu is targeting UNRWA schools.\u201d In its statement on the strike, the IDF said that\u00a0the Israeli Air Force struck \u201ca number of terrorists who were operating in the area of UNRWA\u2019s Abu Oraiban School building in Nuseirat. This location served as a hideout and operational infrastructure from which attacks against IDF troops operating in the Gaza Strip were directed and carried out.\u201d CNN is unable to verify independently whether Hamas operatives were present at the site. Weapons researchers contacted by CNN were able to identify parts of the missiles used in the attack. Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), cautioned that \u201cMany pieces are too damaged to allow for a positive ID.\u201d But one image, he said, featured \u201cdistinctive screw housings, fin slots, and the internal mechanism of a GBU-39\u2019s tail section.\u201d The GBU-39 is a 250lb small-diameter guided air-to-surface munition made by Boeing. Trevor Ball, who was a senior explosive ordnance disposal team member in the US Army, agreed that the images likely showed part of the fin of a small-diameter bomb. Ball told CNN there were also fragments of a US-made Hellfire missile at the site, including the top of the guidance system. \u201cIt\u2019s likely there was a different munition involved as well, as there is minimal damage on the rooftop from the later strike from what pictures I saw.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/middleeast/us-munitions-israeli-strike-gaza-school-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_rwanda-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Rwandans lined up on Monday to elect their next president, with early results putting incumbent Paul Kagame in the lead in a vote widely expected\u00a0to give him a fourth term and extend his near quarter century in charge of the East African country. The two men standing against him \u2013 Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana \u2013 said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame\u2019s overwhelming victory was all but certain. Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end\u00a0the 1994 genocide in\u00a0Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy. Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening. Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed. Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stability candidate. His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of\u00a0supporting rebels\u00a0in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 a charge he has also denied. Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling center in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent. \u201cWe voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,\u201d Pheneas said. \u201cI voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.\u201d Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen. \u201cI voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,\u201d Vedaste said. The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame\u2019s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents. Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress. \u201cWe toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,\u201d Habineza said after voting. \u201cWe have to maintain this momentum and not regress,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are confident, each of us is confident, it\u2019s half and half,\u201d independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote. The US State Department says on its website\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0has made \u201cprogress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation.\u201d It also says it backs\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0efforts to \u201cincrease democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/rwanda-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_ukraine-russian-strike-childrens-hospital-intl", "text": "A Russian missile strike partially destroyed a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv on Monday, causing terrified patients and their families to flee for their lives. Moscow launched a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across Ukraine during morning rush hour, killing at least 43 people, according to the latest figures released by authorities on Tuesday. Search and rescue operations continued into Tuesday after the large-scale bombardment struck the capital, as well as in Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. The death toll includes 33 people in Kyiv, Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko said in an update Tuesday. Earlier, Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said four children were among the dead after a boy\u2019s body was found under the rubble in the capital\u2019s Shevchenkivskyi district. Two people were killed and at least 16 others injured in the strike on Kyiv\u2019s Okhmatdyt hospital. The facility is Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s medical center and has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country. Every year, around 7,000 surgeries \u2013 including treatments for cancer and hematological diseases \u2013 are conducted at the hospital, according to Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman\u00a0Dmytro Lubinets. Footage from the children\u2019s hospital showed volunteers working with police and security services to sift through the rubble as smoke billowed from the facility, as staff described how they tried to rush children to safety in the wake of the attack. Two floors of the hospital were demolished, comprising\u00a0an area of 400 square meters (4,300 sq. ft.), the emergency service said, while Ukraine\u2019s health minister Viktor Liashko said intensive care units, oncology departments and surgery units had been damaged. \u201cNow we have evacuated all the children. Those who came for routine treatment have gone home, consulted with their doctors, and will decide where they will continue their treatment,\u201d he told CNN Tuesday. \u201cThe rest of the children who were on oxygen support and connected to life support devices are now in hospitals and are being provided with adequate medical care.\u201d The attacks were part of a rare daylight bombardment on Ukrainian cities, some of which are heavily populated areas far from the front lines. It came a day before US President Joe Biden was set to host a crucial NATO Summit in Washington, where announcements over the alliance\u2019s military, political and financial support for Kyiv are expected. Biden called the strikes a \u201chorrific reminder of Russia\u2019s brutality.\u201d \u201cIt is critical that the world continues to stand with Ukraine at this important moment and that we not ignore Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said, noting that he would meet with Volodymyr Zelensky during the summit \u201cto make clear our support for Ukraine is unshakeable.\u201d Meanwhile, seven people were killed in a Russian attack Monday on a private medical facility in Kyiv belonging to the Adonis network, the company said. Of those killed, five were staff members and two were patients, Adonis said. Russia\u2019s defense ministry on Monday claimed that Moscow had struck \u201cmilitary industrial facilities of Ukraine and air bases of the Ukrainian armed forces\u201d using long-range, high-precision weapons. At a special meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday called to discuss the Russian strike, Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia denied targeting the children\u2019s hospital. \u201cWe have not bombed the children\u2019s hospital,\u201d Nebenzia said\u00a0when responding to an accusation that Russia committed a war crime for allegedly striking the hospital. Eyewitnesses recount hospital strike Eyewitnesses recalled scenes of chaos moments after the Russian missile slammed into the children\u2019s hospital. Ophthalmologist Lesya Lysytsia told CNN: \u201cYou see the light, then the sound, then everything falls down and then over the next several seconds you think, \u2018are you still alive or is it the end and what to do? Where are the patients? How are the patients? How are the children?\u2019\u201d Natalia Sardudinova, a senior nurse, described the strike as \u201cscary,\u201d when \u201cwindows were crunching.\u201d She told CNN that two children were in operating theaters at the time of the blast, and they were relocated to a shelter in the basement once their procedures were completed. \u201cEverything was in smoke, there was no air to breathe. The doctor was cut by shrapnel. The windows and doors were blown out. One nurse in the hospital was heavily injured,\u201d Sardudinova added. \u201cMy hands are still shaking. They don\u2019t let anyone in now, they are afraid it will collapse.\u201d Yulia Vasylenko, the mother of an 11-year-old cancer patient at the hospital, said her son Denys was evacuated outside following the strike. \u201cMy son is on painkillers. He has cancer. He has been without medication for half a day. He was brought down the stairs from the third floor. There was smoke (and) heavy dust,\u201d she said. Iryna Filimonova, a senior nurse at the pediatric urology department, told CNN an operation on a 2-year-old was underway when the strike happened. \u201cThe lights went out, everything went out. We pulled out the instruments, shining flashlights. Everything was sewn up quickly,\u201d Filimonova said. \u201cThe baby was brought down (to the shelter)\u2026 Some of my nursing colleagues who worked in the operating theaters and some doctors were cut by glass fragments. Our department was destroyed.\u201d Another operating theater nurse, Oksana Mosiychuk, said one medical team tried to extinguish a blaze that broke out in their department, including an operating table which had caught fire. Air raid sirens continued to ring out over Kyiv in the aftermath, with CNN video showing people who had been evacuated pushing children on stretchers to safety. Scores of volunteers later dropped off much-needed supplies and donations \u2013 including water, food, medicine and diapers \u2013 to the hospital. A UN team who visited the site later saw children \u201creceiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds set up in parks and on streets, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas, amongst chaos, dust and debris,\u201d the UN\u2019s human rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. In the hospital\u2019s newer building, 12 departments were damaged, and a section of Ukraine\u2019s only oncology and hematology laboratory was completely destroyed, according to the Kyiv military administration. UN holds special meeting Zelensky had called for an emergency assembly of the UN Security Council after the strike while vowing retaliation over the attacks. At the special meeting Tuesday, Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador, alleged, without any proof, that a\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0anti-aircraft missile is what struck the hospital. \u201cIf this had been a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building at all. All the children and most of the adults would have been killed, not wounded,\u201d Nebenzia said. Ukraine shot down 30 out of 38 missiles launched by Russia during the Monday attack, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Force said in a statement, adding that Moscow used ballistic, cruise, guided and air-launched ballistic missiles. Ukrainian defense minister, Rustem Umerov, appealed for more air defense systems to support the war-torn country. Zelensky has repeatedly called on the West to provide it with more air defense systems to better protect its cities. Last month, he praised Biden for prioritizing a delivery after the two presidents signed a security agreement. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general sent evidence of Monday\u2019s Russian attacks to the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Monday. It came as several European nations denounced the shelling, with France urging for the attack to \u201cbe added to the list of war crimes for which Russia will be held to account.\u201d Germany and Slovakia have agreed to take in children from Ukraine for treatment. German health minister Karl Lauterbach said a rescue flight will leave on Wednesday, according to a post from the German embassy in London on X. Meanwhile, the Czech foreign minister said he summoned the Russian ambassador in Prague over the attack on the hospital. Monday\u2019s attack is the tragic but all too familiar reality for many of Ukraine\u2019s civilians over the past two and a half years since Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion. Since February 2022, the conflict has claimed the lives of 11,126 people and injured 21,863 others, according to data in May from the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Additionally, the heavy fighting has caused an estimated 3.7 million people to be driven from their homes and internally displaced while nearly 6.5 million people have fled to neighboring countries, the UNHCR has said. According to the World Health Organization, there have been more than 1,600 instances of heavy weapons attacks impacting medical facilities in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, with 141 people killed in these attacks. Health minister Liashko told CNN on Tuesday that of the impacted facilities, \u201cmore than 250 have been completely destroyed and cannot be restored. Only new ones can be built.\u201d Last December, 12 pregnant women and four newborn babies had a fortunate escape from a maternity hospital in Dnipro that had been extensively damaged in an airstrike. Previously, the bombing of a maternity and children\u2019s hospital in Mariupol less than a month after Russian troops flooded across the border sparked international condemnation.

{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_gambia-upholds-fgm-ban-intl", "text": "Gambia\u2019s parliament has voted to uphold a landmark law that bans female genital mutilation (FGM) in the largely Muslim nation, after religious groups pushed for the legislation to be repealed. If Monday\u2019s bid had been successful, the tiny West African country would have been the first in the world to relegalize FGM after criminalizing it. MP Amadou Camara, who chairs a joint health and gender committee that recommended that FGM should remain outlawed, told CNN that none of the clauses seeking the repeal of the ban in the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed. Parliament Speaker Fabakary Jatta\u00a0ruled that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the bill, which passed a second reading four months ago, to be read a third time and to pass without those clauses. \u201cI so rule that the bill is rejected, and the legislative process exhausted,\u201d Jatta said at plenary meeting Monday. FGM was prohibited in Gambia in 2015 by former president Yahya Jammeh who authorized the\u00a0imposition of fines and prison sentences\u00a0of up to three years for individuals who engaged in it. The law also punished perpetrators with life sentences in cases where the practice led to death. Pro-Islamic groups and lawmakers pushed back against the criminalization, saying that female circumcision was \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d Other prominent Gambians, such as opposition leader and former interior minister Mai Ahmad Fatty also defended the practice, arguing that: \u201cThere is no FGM in Gambia. We circumcise, not mutilate.\u201d Human rights organization Amnesty International earlier described efforts to revoke the FGM ban as a \u201cbackward move\u201d for the protection of human rights in the country. In Gambia, 73% of women aged between 15 and 49 years had experienced FGM as of 2020, according to the United Nations. More than 65% of those women were subjected to the practice \u201cbefore the age of five years,\u201d the UN said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Women\u2019s Day in March that he was \u201coutraged\u201d by moves by Gambia\u2019s parliament to legalize FGM, describing the practice as \u201chorrific.\u201d Despite the ban, FGM has still been performed on children in parts of the country. Last year, three women were convicted of performing the practice on eight female minors\u00a0and ordered to pay fines of around 15,000 Gambian Dalasi ($220) each or face a one-year jail sentence. The penalties were\u00a0reported\u00a0to have been paid by an Islamic cleric. In 2016, two women also faced charges\u00a0after a 5-month-old girl died from genital mutilation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/gambia-upholds-fgm-ban-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_middleeast_hamas-commander-killed-khan-younis-intl", "text": "Israel has announced that a Hamas commander was killed in Saturday\u2019s strike on southern Gaza, but the fate of the major target, Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, remains uncertain. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Sunday that Rafe Salama, the head of the Khan Younis brigade and Deif\u2019s deputy, was \u201celiminated\u201d in the attack. According to the statement, Salama was \u201cone of the closest associates\u201d of Deif, as well as \u201cone of the masterminds\u201d of Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7. It remains unclear if Deif himself died in Saturday\u2019s strike. The Israeli military is verifying whether he was killed while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday it is uncertain whether he died. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said the strike killed at least 90 Palestinians  and injured 300 others in Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian zone. The UN\u2019s Scott Anderson described what he saw at a nearby hospital in the aftermath of the strikes as \u201cthe most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.\u201d An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the architects behind the\u00a0October 7 attacks. He has led the Palestinian militant group\u2019s armed wing for more than two decades. If his death is confirmed, Deif would be the highest profile Hamas leader killed since the war in Gaza began nine months ago. Israel has been seeking to dismantle Hamas following the October 7 attacks but with fighting ongoing and senior Hamas figures at large, that goal has seemed distant. Strike could help deal, Netanyahu claims Netanyahu told the Israeli Channel 14 network on Monday that it was still unclear whether the strike had killed Deif, but added that there were \u201cinteresting indications, I don\u2019t want to say something certainly before we receive more information.\u201d Asked whether the strike could put at risk a potential hostage release and ceasefire deal, Netanyahu insisted it would actually promote a deal. \u201cHamas is weak. The more you hit it, the more you push for a deal,\u201d he told the network. Netanyahu said that for months Hamas \u201cthought they were safe, [now] they see they\u2019re unsafe. The IDF forcefully entered the Philadelphi corridor [along the Egyptian border], conquered the Rafah crossing.\u201d \u201cThis pressure, along with the fierce diplomatic standing of the political echelon and myself over the things we demand, gradually makes them change, surrender, or at least become more flexible. Now we need to increase the pressure. The more pressure we apply, we will get a deal that releases the maximum number of living hostages during the first phase, and gets us closer to our goal of destroying Hamas.\u201d Netanyahu also said the IDF would remain along the Philadelphi corridor, which has been a contentious issue in the negotiations. \u201cThis has consequences, both diplomatic and security related advantages,\u201d he said. Israeli intelligence services said this past week they killed a total of 25 Hamas operatives involved in the October 7 attacks. Ronen Bar, the head of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, announced the figure during a meeting with commanders from the IDF\u2019s Southern Command and 162 Division held in Rafah on Saturday. Bar commended the results of the Shin Bet\u2019s \u201cintensified activity\u201d within Gaza. Meanwhile, a fresh Israeli airstrike that hit a UN agency school in a camp for displaced people in central Gaza on Sunday has killed at least 22 and injured more than 100 others, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza and officials at a nearby hospital.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

Authorities said Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, \u201clured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies,\u201d of which only nine have been recovered. He was arrested in Soweto, east of the capital Nairobi, at 3 a.m. local time on Monday, outside a club where he had gone to watch the Euro 2024 soccer final, Kenya\u2019s director of criminal investigations,\u00a0Mohamed Amin,\u00a0told journalists on Monday. \u201cOn interrogation, the suspect confessed to having lured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies at the dumping site, all murdered between 2022 and Thursday, 11 July, 2024,\u201d Amin said. Acting police inspector general, Douglas Kanja, added in a statement that the \u201cpost-mortem examination is happening today\u201d on the nine bodies recovered so far. In a news conference on Sunday before the suspect\u2019s arrest, Kanja said the bodies \u201cwere severely dismembered, in different states of decomposition, and left in sacks.\u201d \u201cWe are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for life,\u201d Amin said Monday. Khalusha \u201cled officers to his single room rented house,\u201d which is located about 100 meters (328 feet) from the crime scene, Amin said. A machete, 12 nylon sacks, a pair of industrial rubber gloves, a hard drive, and eight smart phones were among \u201ccrucial\u201d items police said they discovered in the rented house.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_europe_russian-missile-strike-kyiv-hospital-un-intl-hnk", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s hospital likely took a direct hit from a Russian missile on Monday, a United Nations assessment has found, as NATO agreed to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s air defenses in the wake of the attack. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting the hospital in Kyiv and alleged, without evidence, that a\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0anti-aircraft missile caused the blast. But a UN human rights official said evidence suggested Moscow\u2019s forces were responsible for the deadly strike. \u201cAnalysis of the video footage and assessment made at the incident site indicates a high likelihood that the children\u2019s hospital suffered a direct hit rather than receiving damages due to an intercepted weapons system,\u201d Danielle Bell, head of the UN\u2019s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, told reporters Tuesday. Bell said the attack damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards at Kyiv\u2019s Okhmatdyt\u00a0hospital, which has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country, adding that Ukrainian officials have since transferred 600 children to other hospitals. \u201cThis terrible attack shows that nowhere is safe in Ukraine,\u201d Bell added. The UN assessment tallies with weapons experts, who told CNN that it was highly likely a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile struck the children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv on Monday. Reviewing video footage that CNN had verified and geolocated and images of fragments from the scene, weapons experts said that evidence strongly suggests the hospital was struck by a Russian cruise missile as opposed to a Ukrainian air defense projectile. Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told CNN Wednesday that the flight profile in the footage of the missile hitting the hospital is \u201cexactly correct for the Kh-101, with the right dive angle, under power and not tumbling or falling like a spent air-defence missile might.\u201d The silhouette of the rocket visible in the footage also matches the Kh-101, Bronk said. Two adults were killed in the strike and 16 others - including seven children - were injured, according to Ukrainian officials,\u00a0as Russia launched\u00a0a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0during morning rush hour, killing at least 43 people in total. The strikes across Ukraine were \u201cstrongly\u201d condemned by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, while the UN\u2019s human rights chief Volker Turk called for \u201cprompt, thorough and independent investigations\u201d into the attacks. The Russian attacks came as NATO leaders gathered in Washington, where the United States and NATO allies agreed to\u00a0give Ukraine more Patriot batteries and additional systems to strengthen\u00a0Kyiv\u2019s air defenses, members of the defense alliance said in a joint statement on Tuesday. US President Joe Biden also announced plans to supply new air defenses to Ukraine in a speech opening the NATO summit \u2013 providing much-needed support for the country at a critical juncture in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion. During his speech on Tuesday, Biden vowed that \u201cthe United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line.\u201d \u2018Targeted attack by Russia\u2019 Images and video from the aftermath of the strike on the Kyiv hospital show children with cancer being treated outside the facility and an injured toddler with blood on his face and arms. A\u00a0CNN team at the site\u00a0on Tuesday said the level of destruction\u00a0there\u00a0showed how forceful the explosion must have been. A pile of debris could be seen in place of where part of the facility once stood, while underneath a section of flooring lay the remnants of a car that was completely flattened when the building came crashing down. The UN\u2019s monitoring mission said it was likely that a KH-101 cruise missile launched by Russia struck the children\u2019s hospital. It made the determination \u201cbased on video footage, which shows the technical specification of the type of weapon that was used\u201d and that such footage \u201cshows the weapon directly impacting the hospital rather than being intercepted in the air,\u201d Bell said. A military expert who visited the site following the blast said the damage is \u201cconsistent with a direct hit,\u201d according to Bell. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Washington on Tuesday that\u00a0\u201cRussia always knows where its missiles hit. Always.\u201d On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia\u00a0reiterated Moscow\u2019s denial that it had targeted the children\u2019s hospital. \u201cWe have not bombed the children\u2019s\u00a0hospital,\u201d\u00a0Nebenzia\u00a0said\u00a0at a special meeting of the UN Security Council (UNSC) convened following the attack. \u201cIf this had been a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building at all. All the children and most of the adults would have been killed, not wounded.\u201d But the US also blamed Russia for the hospital strike. US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield\u00a0told the UNSC meeting that the Russian \u201cattack makes abundantly clear: Putin is not interested in peace.\u201d Kyiv described the strike as a \u201ctargeted attack by Russia,\u201d with the Ukrainian State Security Service (SBU) saying a Russian\u00a0long-range cruise missile struck the facility. \u201cRelevant evidence has already been found at the scene of the tragedy: in particular, fragments of the rear part of the Kh-101 missile with a serial number and part of the steering wheel of the same missile,\u201d the SBU said. SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk vowed the agency would respond to what he said were Russian war crimes. \u201cThis retribution will be both legal and moral,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/europe/russian-missile-strike-kyiv-hospital-un-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Two paintings and a drawing by Pablo Picasso  were originally featured in American artist and museum curator  Kirsha Kaechele\u2019s \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d installation at Tasmania\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) \u2013 \u00a0which opened in December 2020 \u2013 \u201cto any and all ladies.\u201d The experiential artwork was billed by the museum as a \u201ctremendously lavish space\u201d where women can indulge in \u201cdecadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures\u201d served by a male butler while they peruse art in a green velvet-draped room. But MONA was ordered to stop refusing entry to \u201cpersons who do not identify as ladies\u201d after the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled in April that the show violated Australia\u2019s 1998 Anti-Discrimination Act. Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room was indeed part of the art \u2014 giving\u00a0them\u00a0a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. The Picasso pieces are now displayed in an upgraded restroom with a fully functional toilet dubbed \u201cLadies Room,\u201d located within the art venue, Kaechele said in an e-mail. \u201cWhile the Ladies Lounge undergoes a series of reforms to meet the exemptions required for reopening, I\u2019ve been doing a little redecorating. I thought a few of the bathrooms in the museum could do with an update,\u201d she added. \u201cSome Cubism in the cubicles.\u201d On Monday, Kaechele posted on Instagram a video and images of the relocated works in situ, and pointed out that the gendered restroom was also a first for the museum. She encouraged \u201call ladies\u201d to enjoy the new exhibition. \u2018Ladies Lounge\u2019 closed \u201cWe never had female toilets at Mona before, they were all unisex.

Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales was barred from entering the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d exhibit on April 1 in 2023. Lau, who had paid the $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, believed he experienced direct gender discrimination. \u201cHe felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,\u201d read the tribunal\u2019s notes. After the judgment, Kaechele said she would challenge the court\u2019s decision in the state\u2019s Supreme Court and offered several possibilities to revive the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d concept. Among those ideas included finding loopholes under Section 27 of the Anti-Discrimination Act which lists exceptions on when discrimination against gender would be permitted. In the meantime the lounge closed so that it wouldn\u2019t have to open to men.

The \u201c(Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan) remains in place and is being implemented in an orderly and phased manner,\u201d spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch told CNN Thursday. Pakistan is home to one of the world\u2019s largest refugee populations \u2013 most of them from Afghanistan. But the country has not always welcomed Afghan refugees, subjecting them to hostile living conditions and threatening deportation over the years. More than 3 million Afghan refugees, including registered refugees and more than 800,000 undocumented people were living in Pakistan as of March 2024, according to UNHCR data. Some fled their home country decades ago during the Soviet invasion, while other Afghans sought refuge in Pakistan when the Taliban retook Afghanistan in 2021, implementing its oppressive rule. Last October, Pakistan gave undocumented Afghans weeks to leave or face deportation, claiming Afghan nationals carried out 14 of 24 major terrorist attacks in Pakistan last year.\u00a0Between September 15, 2023 and the end of June, about 650,000 Afghans had returned home, according to the UNHCR. Some 32,000 of them were deported. They\u2019re returning to a country under the control of a militant regime that has imposed a form of gender apartheid and where millions live in poverty. A UN report published Tuesday detailed human rights violations by the Taliban\u2019s so-called morality police \u2013 which have disproportionately targeted women and girls \u2013 creating a \u201cclimate of fear and intimidation\u201d in Afghanistan. Moniza Kakar, a lawyer who helps Afghan migrants navigate Pakistan\u2019s legal system, said the POR card extension will not provide stability for all refugees. \u201cAfghan communities that I have spoken to are still concerned since there are many instances of households where a man might have a POR card and his wife and kids would have no documentation,\u201d Kakar told CNN. \u201cThere is still a huge worry amongst families of being split because of these issues of documentation.\u201d Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, regional researcher for South Asia at Amnesty International, said the human rights group had \u201cdocumented extensive delays and barriers refugees face in obtaining POR cards.\u201d The status of 80,000 Afghan Citizen Card holders, another form of registration for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, was also uncertain, Ruwanpathirana added. \u201cWe urge the government of Pakistan to formally suspend its \u2018Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan,\u2019 stop all deportations, and develop a national legal framework to regulate access to refugee status in line with international refugee law,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_07_13_asia_malayan-tiger-deaths-malaysia-extinction-intl-hnk", "text": "A recent spate of alarming deaths has heightened fears for the Malayan tiger, wildlife authorities and conservationists say, with some calling the threat to Malaysia\u2019s emblematic animal a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d Native to the jungles of peninsular Malaysia, the majestic feline subspecies is critically endangered, with fewer than 150 believed to be left in the wild due to habitat loss, illegal poaching and a decline in prey. Found on Malaysia\u2019s coat of arms and considered a national heritage symbol, its numbers have plummeted since the 1950s, when around 3,000 roamed the Southeast Asian country, officials say. Against that already grim backdrop, photos and videos of a dead Malayan tiger went viral on social media in late June. The carcass, found bloated and floating in a stream in the rural northern state of Kelantan, was discovered by forest rangers. There was no sign of injury from snares or gunshots, and state forestry officials are conducting a post-mortem examination. The images provoked strong reactions from many in Malaysia, who noted the urgency of saving their national symbol from extinction. \u201cThe plight of Malayan tigers is a national crisis that requires the full attention and commitment of all Malaysians,\u201d Henry Chan, director of conservation at the World Wildlife Fund Malaysia (WWF), told CNN. Stronger conservation efforts are needed, he added, such as enhancing patrols in critical tiger habitats and leveraging advanced technology such as camera traps and drones for monitoring and surveillance. \u201cThese magnificent creatures continue to teeter on the brink of extinction,\u201d Chan said. \u201cLosing just one tiger brings the entire species closer to extinction, making every individual tiger\u2019s life extremely critical to the survival of the species.\u201d \u201cThe Malayan tiger is on the brink of extinction with fewer than 150 remaining in the wild,\u201d said Mark Rayan Darmaraj, country director of Wildlife Conservation Society Malaysia, who noted that suspected poachers were arrested in a separate case in the nearby state of Pahang the following day, \u201cin possession of the skull and bones of a tiger.\u201d \u201cThey suffer from habitat loss, prey depletion and retaliatory killings stemming from human-tiger conflicts,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, the construction of roads through their habitats increases the risk of fatal vehicle collisions as seen in several recent incidents.\u201d On July 6, authorities in the western state of Perak were alerted to a dead tiger found in a storm drain off a major highway. Estimated to have been around 4 years old, the adult male had been hit by a car, officials said. A month earlier, the body of another adult tiger was found by an expressway in Pahang state. Officials believe the tiger, believed to have been 5 years old, was run over by a vehicle while trying to cross the road from a nearby forest reserve. It was the fourth Malayan tiger killed by a vehicle collision between November 2023 and May 2024, according to authorities. Eight-year plan The Malayan tiger was recognized as a subspecies in 2004. Like all tigers, they are excellent swimmers and powerful apex predators. Smaller than Indonesia\u2019s Sumatran tigers and the Bengal tigers found across South Asia, Malayan tigers can grow to about 2.5 meters (about 8 feet) long and weigh up to 130 kilograms (about 280 pounds), experts say, and need large swaths of forest to roam. Their slightly darker, reddish-orange coats also distinguish them from other tiger species. In an eight-year National Tiger Conservation Action Plan released in collaboration with non-profit groups in 2020, Malaysian officials outlined priorities such as conservation tools and a \u201cNational Physical Plan\u201d to aid conservation efforts. \u201cBy implementing a suite of concerted actions, backed by political commitment and public support, we as a nation and as part of the global conservation community can ensure that one of the most majestic and charismatic animals with which we share the planet will not vanish,\u201d the report said. CNN has reached out to official wildlife agencies for further comment about recent tiger conservation efforts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/asia/malayan-tiger-deaths-malaysia-extinction-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_400-tourists-lord-howe-island-australia", "text": "Lord Howe Island has the look of a destination ripe for overtourism, with verdant mountaintops, pristine white-sand beaches and clear-blue waters teeming with colorful fish. Yet on this island of around 400 people, located 372 miles off the east coast of mainland Australia, the beaches are empty. The only sounds on a hike through its rainforests and mountains come from the wildlife. \u201cIt\u2019s what is not here that provides that experience \u2013 that is why it\u2019s so unique,\u201d said Lisa Makiiti, a sixth-generation islander who runs the boutique accommodation Bowker Beach House. There\u2019s \u201cvalue of having somewhere in the world that works in the reverse to every other tourist destination. It\u2019s not bigger and better and more and more.\u201d The secret to that unspoiled landscape is a tactic used in very few other places: limiting the number of tourists who can visit at all. For over 40 years, Lord Howe has implemented a cap of 400 tourists at a time by fixing the number of beds available to visitors. This was to protect Lord Howe\u2019s many unique endemic species, which helped the island earn recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982. Although the number was arbitrary, maintaining it has minimized environmental impacts\u00a0and created a \u201cone-for-one visitor to local\u201d experience, said Darcelle Matassoni, a sixth-generation islander who works for the Lord Howe Island Board, the island\u2019s government. Unsurprisingly, that means it\u2019s difficult to get there; Makiiti says Bowker has bookings well into 2026. Airfares for a return trip to Sydney can run upwards of US$666, and in peak summer season, accommodation for two can range from US$200 to over US$3,000 per night. \u2018Alien concept\u2019 Those policies showcase a \u201cunited desire to make sure that nature comes out on top,\u201d said Dean Hiscox, who runs Lord Howe Environmental Tours. More than 85% of the island is still covered in its native forest, and around 70% is in a Permanent Park Preserve, meaning all development is prohibited. The residential settlement covers 15%. Visitors often wonder if there\u2019s pressure for more development, but on Lord Howe, that\u2019s an \u201calien concept,\u201d Hiscox said. Even the local community is effectively capped because of  rules on housing. Many residents are descended from original settlers who arrived in the 1800s. \u201cThose families that have been here for those five, six, seven generations have always recognized how special their lifestyle is here,\u201d said Ian Hutton, a naturalist and photographer who has lived on the island since 1980. \u201cThere is that strong generational feeling of protecting their island.\u201d Nature like nowhere else in the world Life on Lord Howe is \u201clike living inside a David Attenborough documentary,\u201d said Hutton, who is also the curator at the Lord Howe Island Museum, on his website. Although it\u2019s just seven miles long, the island is densely packed with plants and animals found nowhere else. The rainforests are filled with creeping plants, orchids and birds. Atop the summit of Mount Gower \u2013 one of the most popular hiking trails on Lord Howe \u2013 sits a rare, endangered cloud forest. The island\u2019s most famous endemic export is seeds of the Kentia Palm, the world\u2019s most popular palm to grow indoors. On the coast, people can walk by nesting colonies of the Providence Petrel, a gray and white seabird with a slightly curved black beak that mainly breeds on Lord Howe. The birds will swoop down when called and are so friendly to humans that a person can pick them up. Much of the allure is the proximity to nature. Beaches are just a few minutes\u2019 walk or bike ride away from the guesthouses, making Lord Howe \u201cthe easiest holiday,\u201d said Anthony Riddle, a sixth-generation islander who co-founded Lord Howe Island Brewing Company and Lord Howe Island Distilling Company. \u201cYou\u2019re only on a boat for five or 10 minutes, and you\u2019re already out to the main reefline. If you try and do that on the Great Barrier Reef, you might be on a boat for three or four hours and still not see nearly as much as you get to see here,\u201d Hiscox said. Around 500 species of fish, as well as starfish, urchins and crabs, populate the world\u2019s southernmost barrier reef right by the island, according to Hutton\u2019s website. One of the best places for diving is Ball\u2019s Pyramid, the world\u2019s tallest sea stack, which sits 14 miles southeast of the main island and is surrounded by caves and waters abundant in rare sea creatures. Like Lord Howe\u2019s residents, those who visit care deeply about preserving the island\u2019s natural world, Hiscox said. Tour guides always explain that tradition of sustainability to their guests, but they don\u2019t have to do much to convince them of its importance. \u201cWe just simply elaborate,\u201d Hiscox said. \u201cWe tell the story about what is it that\u2019s special about Lord Howe Island. You have a captive audience who are already tuned into that philosophy, and want to know about it. You\u2019re talking to the converted.\u201d Many visitors take that passion a step further by participating in local conservation programs. The Island Board has implemented a paid weed eradication program, and Hutton runs weeding ecotours and citizen science campaigns. Sniffer dogs There are also strict biosecurity procedures to protect against invasive species. All imports and visitors are checked, including by sniffer dogs. At the beginning of walking tracks, there are stations for hikers to scrub their boots to stop the spread of fungus. It\u2019s a level of intense conservation that blows people away from the moment they get off the airplane, Hutton said. \u201cThe sniffer dogs check their bags and (visitors) find out that the dogs are not looking for marijuana, they\u2019re just looking for rats and frogs,\u201d Hutton said. The island has carried out removals of introduced predatory feral pigs, goats and cats, and new domestic cats have been banned since 1982. Animals that were introduced to combat invasive species have also been removed. The one recent point of contention has been a successful government initiative in 2019 to eradicate rats and mice, which were destroying native species. The initiative was widely supported, but the use of a chemical rodenticide and the regular property inspections upset some. After the elimination of the rodents, many under-threat native species are now thriving. The Woodhen, a flightless bird that is one of the world\u2019s rarest, almost went extinct but its numbers have increased tenfold since the eradication, Hutton said. Despite efforts by the government and citizens to protect the island, many of its defining features are under threat from climate change.\u00a0A long run of record-breaking air and ocean temperatures fueled by climate change and the natural El Nino phenomenon has\u00a0caused several massive coral bleaching events and dieback in the cloud forest.\u00a0The increasing frequency of severe weather events means their future survival is \u201cin the lap of the gods,\u201d Hiscox said. An isolated history Lord Howe is today just a two-hour plane ride from the mainland, but historically the island and its close-knit community have been isolated. For decades, the only way to get there was by seaplane. These \u201cflying boats\u201d first began  regular flights to Lord Howe just after the end of World War II, and from the 1950s onward ferried passengers back and forth from Sydney six times a week, according to the Australian National Maritime Museum. The journey took around three hours each way. For islanders, life during that time was slow and nonmaterialistic. \u201cThere was no television, no internet, no telephones. We lived a completely unfettered and natural lifestyle. And pretty feral, I suspect, but safe feral,\u201d said Makiiti. \u201cNo shoes and everyone\u2019s main priority was that you could swim, but we just roamed the island in complete freedom and were outside all the time fishing and swimming and just hanging out.\u201d After the government built an airstrip in the 1970s, use of the flying boats ceased, and \u201csuddenly things speeded up a little bit,\u201d Makiiti said. But in many ways life on Lord Howe today is unchanged. Residents keep their doors unlocked, and there is no mobile phone service outside of home Wi-Fi networks. That isolation has bred challenges, but islanders have found unique ways to adapt. There is no secondary school, meaning all children must do distance education or attend boarding schools on the mainland. Buying anything takes a lot of thought because all imports, including food, must come on the fortnightly freight ship. The cost of living is triple that on the mainland \u2013 one apple costs US$2 and a liter of gas and a liter of milk each cost US$2.66, Riddle said. Many islanders have partially offset those costs by farming and gardening \u2013 in the island\u2019s subtropical climate, they can grow most anything from root vegetables to avocados, and have native botanicals like wild lemons. There\u2019s also a bartering system. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a nice other aspect of a connected community, where you\u2019re just sharing everything around and when you have too much of something, everybody benefits from that as well,\u201d Matassoni said. Sustainability in their DNA Despite the challenges, residents feel lucky to live as they do \u2013 rejecting excess with a mentality that\u2019s \u201call about reuse, reduce and look after,\u201d Makiiti said. It\u2019s a relaxed place where people spend their free time surfing, swimming and hiking, and most everyone gets around on bicycles. Respect for the environment is \u201cinstilled in us from a very young age,\u201d Matassoni said, \u201cbecause we are stewards of that environment.\u201d Residents and visitors alike \u201care very conscious of just a simple thing like not dropping an ice cream wrapper,\u201d Hutton said. Around 80% of the island\u2019s electricity is powered by a community solar grid, Hutton said. Everyone is also required to sort their own waste and bring it to the island\u2019s waste management facility. Anything that can\u2019t be reused, composted or recycled gets turned into garden mulch. \u201cNobody likes red tape but everybody understands that it\u2019s all in aid of making sure that we get to keep the lifestyle we have, that we get to keep the natural environment the way it is, that we are all very lucky to be here,\u201d Matassoni said. Makiiti says Bowker Beach House pays attention to the little details \u2013 the toiletries and coffee cups are reusable, and they even send coffee pods back to Nespresso. The eggs laid by the beach house\u2019s chickens go in reusable containers. Islanders \u201calways use the analogy less is more,\u201d Riddle said. \u201cThe longer we can keep it more unique like this, the more unique we are in the world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/400-tourists-lord-howe-island-australia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_uk_starmer-nato-biden-interview-tapper-gbr-intl", "text": "Winston Churchill, often considered Britain\u2019s greatest leader, resigned at 80 in the face of mounting health problems. Keir Starmer, Britain\u2019s newest leader, wants to force lawmakers in the country\u2019s upper chamber to step down at the same age. Does this mean he thinks octogenarians like President Joe Biden should step back from politics? \u201cObviously in America, it\u2019s for the American people to decide who they want to be their president,\u201d Starmer told\u00a0CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper\u00a0in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington, a week after he became prime minister of the United Kingdom. Despite growing questions about Biden\u2019s mental acuity and fitness for a second term, Starmer said the 81-year-old president had been \u201cin good form\u201d when the two met for talks,\u00a0but \u201cof course\u201d he would say if he was concerned about him. In the interview on CNN\u2019s The Lead,\u00a0Starmer also reaffirmed his new government\u2019s \u201cunshakable support\u201d for the NATO alliance,\u00a0described King Charles III as \u201cincredible,\u201d\u00a0and discussed how he \u201cdragged\u201d his party back to the center ground in British politics, a feat which helped him consign the Conservative Party to its worst-ever defeat in last week\u2019s election. Starmer, 61, is the latest in a series of world leaders who have been asked whether Biden is too old to campaign and govern effectively. But he spoke positively about their discussions at the summit on Wednesday. \u201cWe were billed for 45 minutes. We probably went on for the best part of an hour, covered a lot of ground \u2013 and he was in good form,\u201d Starmer\u00a0told Tapper. Starmer said the talks were \u201ca really good opportunity\u201d for him to \u201cspeak to the president about the special relationship\u201d between their two countries. He said Biden \u201cdeserves credit\u201d for presiding over a summit that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called a success. Zelensky\u2019s comments were made before Biden mistakenly introduced the Ukrainian leader as \u201cPresident Putin,\u201d having to correct himself hastily. In a press conference later Thursday evening, Biden also mistakenly called his Vice President, Kamala Harris \u201cVice President Trump\u201d when discussing if she could beat the former president. On his plan to force lawmakers in the House of Lords \u2013 which scrutinizes the government and makes recommendations on laws \u2013 to step down after turning 80, Starmer said the policy was \u201cmore to do with the size\u201d of the unelected upper chamber than the fitness of elderly politicians. \u201cOur second chamber is the biggest second chamber in the world. We\u2019ve got over 800 members. We\u2019ve got to get the size down,\u201d he said. Starmer is not alone in trying to downplay concerns about Biden\u2019s age. French President Emmanuel Macron, attending the summit in a weakened position with his country in political limbo after a snap parliamentary election, said Biden remained \u201cin charge\u201d and \u201cclear on the issues he knows well.\u201d Starmer was\u00a0also\u00a0asked\u00a0by Tapper\u00a0to clarify comments made by David Lammy, a longstanding Labour politician who became Britain\u2019s foreign secretary last week. In 2018, Lammy called then-President Donald Trump \u2013 who will also turn 80 in office if re-elected to a second term in November \u2013 a \u201cwoman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath\u201d and a \u201cprofound threat to the international order.\u201d Starmer said his government will \u201cwork with whoever is elected\u201d in November, but stressed \u201cI\u2019m a progressive and we\u2019re sister parties with the Democrats.\u201d Starmer\u2019s comments echoed his previous remarks on a potential Trump presidency; he told the BBC last year he would \u201chave to make it work,\u201d though that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cwe would agree on everything.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s threats to leave NATO and cut a deal with Putin, likely ending the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia, Starmer praised the \u201cclarity of purpose\u201d that other members have shown in the alliance during the summit. He also said Britain remains \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to raising its defense spending to 2.5% \u2013 above the NATO guideline of 2% \u2013 but did not provide a timeline for this. \u201cMy position as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom could not be clearer, which is an unshakable support for NATO,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were proudly one of the countries that was there at the founding of NATO\u2026 We\u2019re proud of that history.\u201d Tacking to the center A week ago, Starmer guided the Labour Party to a historic victory, winning a majority of 172 seats in the House of Commons and bringing to an end 14 years of Conservative rule. But, almost immediately, Starmer\u2019s victory was described as hollow and his mandate fragile, with critics pointing out Labour\u2019s relatively low share of the popular vote, despite its commanding victory under Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. Asked if his victory was fueled more by anger towards the Conservatives than enthusiasm for Labour, Starmer hit back, saying his team deserved praise for turning the party around after it slumped to a dismal defeat in 2019 under the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cI took over the Labour Party four and a half years ago. We\u2019d just had the worst general election result since 1935. The pessimists were saying, \u2018The Labour Party will never win a general election again.\u2019 The optimists said, \u2018Well you might, but it will take you 10 years,\u2019\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, we\u2019re going to do it in one parliamentary term. But we\u2019ve got to be ruthless, we\u2019ve got to be steely, we\u2019re going to change the Labour Party, we\u2019re going to turn it inside out and make sure it\u2019s a party that always says: Country first, party second.\u2019\u201d He said he had managed to pull his party back to the center ground, shunning the extremes. \u201cBrits are reasonable, tolerant \u2013 they don\u2019t much like the extreme left, they don\u2019t much like the extreme right. And we underestimate that,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the phrases I used in the election was we need a politics that trod more lightly on people\u2019s lives. And that\u2019s very important in Britain.\u201d Although he ruled out trying to rejoin the European Union, Starmer said he wanted to \u201creset\u201d Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc. Starmer\u2019s \u201cnumber one mission,\u201d he said, is to restore Britain to economic growth, which has virtually flatlined since the 2008 financial crisis Starmer has softened his view on the British monarchy, having once talked about abolishing it, and said he was looking forward to his weekly audience with King Charles III, now he\u2019s become prime minister. \u201cIt is always valuable to listen to what he has to say. He\u2019s incredibly interested in politics, in the affairs across the United Kingdom, and global affairs,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cThey\u2019re a really good frank exchange of views and long may they continue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/uk/starmer-nato-biden-interview-tapper-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_americas_panama-darien-gap-barbed-wire-migrants-intl-latam", "text": "Panama\u00a0has placed barbed wire across several routes in the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the country\u2019s Ministry of Public Security said in a statement Thursday, in a bid to block migrants making their way north. At least five passages near Panama\u2019s border with Colombia have been shut using barbed wire installed by\u00a0the country\u2019s border agency (Senafront). Meanwhile, Panama\u2019s navy is patrolling areas in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. The government said the navy is instructed to stop and detain people traveling by boat with \u201cirregular migrants\u201d and to hand them over to police or immigration authorities from Colombia. On land, border authorities have closed irregular access areas with the goal of rerouting people through established border points. The United States and Panama signed\u00a0an agreement this month on immigration issues that aimed to \u201cclose the passage of illegal migrants\u201d through the Dari\u00e9n Gap. Panama\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino has also vowed to stop the Central American country from being a transit route for migrants. \u201cI will not allow\u00a0Panama\u00a0to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino\u00a0said at his swearing-in ceremony on July 1. Mulino visited the Dari\u00e9n Gap days before Thursday\u2019s announcement, saying 300 border agents were going to be deployed to monitor the area and declaring that no one would enter\u00a0Panamanian territory without a passport or a valid document. Colombia\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s Office has criticized Panama\u2019s latest move saying that the barbed wires affect at least one Colombian town\u2019s commercial and cultural exchange with areas in\u00a0Panama. \u201cThe barbed wires in the jungle will only bring drowned people into the sea. Migration is stopped by removing economic blockades and improving the economy of the south,\u201d Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro wrote on X. The Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the\u00a0Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap\u00a0brings migrants from Colombia to\u00a0Panama\u00a0and is a crucial passage for those \u2013 many of whom come from other Latin American countries \u2013 hoping to reach the US and Canada. Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap, from January to June 6 of this year.

{"id": "2024_07_09_americas_american-mountaineer-body-found-peru-intl-latam", "text": "The body of an American mountaineer has been discovered by a pair of fellow US climbers 22 years after he went missing following an avalanche in the Peruvian Andes. American\u00a0brothers\u00a0Ryan Cooper and Wesley Waren found the body of Bill Stampfl on June 27 on Mount Huascaran,\u00a0according to Joseph Stampfl, Bill\u2019s son. The climbers had been descending the mountain in Peru\u2019s Cordillera Blanca after an unsuccessful attempt to reach its 22,000 ft summit when they found the body, at about 16,500 ft. Cooper told CNN Tuesday they noticed an object that didn\u2019t quite blend into the landscape and decided to investigate. He said the ice had preserved the body and its belongings and Stampfl\u2019s wedding ring, helmet, mountain climbing boots, and jacket were all intact. The brothers managed to identify Stampfl by finding a bag attached to his body, inside which they found his identification card, a camera, passport, wallet, and glasses \u2013 all of which were also intact, Cooper explained. \u201cSomeone loved him and someone wanted him to come home,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAs soon as I found out he was an American climber I knew we had a responsibility to track down the family and give them the news,\u201d Cooper said. Stampfl and two of his fellow climbers and\u00a0friends, Steve Erskine\u00a0and Matthew Richardson, were all killed by an avalanche on Mount Huascaran on June 24, 2002, his daughter Jennifer Stampfl told CNN on Tuesday. Their bodies were never discovered, except for Erskine\u2019s, she said. Stampfl was 58-years-old at the time. His body was retrieved and brought down the mountain on July 5 by the Peruvian Mountain Rescue Association and Peruvian National Police after coordination with Cooper and Stampfl\u2019s family. His body was taken to a morgue in the town of Yungay for an autopsy, Peru\u2019s National Police posted on X on Tuesday. The US State Department confirmed the death of a US citizen in Peru. \u201cWe offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss and thank the mountaineers and the Peruvian National Police rescue team who have been involved in this operation,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said, adding it was providing assistance to the family. Finding Bill\u2019s family Cooper, a native of Las Vegas, Nevada, called his wife and informed her of his discovery the same day he came across Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0body. He\u00a0asked her for help in finding Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0family, as he was still on Mount Huascaran with limited cellular service. After much online research, Cooper\u2019s wife was able to locate Joseph and called him on June 29. \u201cI told him I know the location of his dad. I told him about the ring and personal items,\u201d Cooper said. His motive was to help the family find closure, Cooper explained. With \u201cno body, there\u2019s no way to find peace with that,\u201d Cooper said. Cooper also spoke to Jennifer and Stampfl\u2019s widow Janet on the phone before sending photos of Stampfl\u2019s ID and other belongings to the family. \u2018My heart just sank\u2019 After so many years, the news came as an emotional shock to Stampfl\u2019s family. \u201cMy heart just sank. After 22 years I had been okay with the fact that he\u2019s there. He\u2019s part of the mountain. Like we\u2019re never going to get him back. The fact that they found him, it opened up all the wounds,\u201d Jennifer told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThere is no preparation for having your husband killed instantaneously,\u201d Janet said, adding that she never thought her husband\u2019s body would be discovered. \u201cIt\u2019s an answer to so many prayers by so many people.\u201d Janet said her husband loved climbing mountains. \u201cHe enjoyed it so much. He said he always felt closest to God when he got to the top of the mountain,\u201d Janet said. \u201cAfter 22 years\u2026I was a little shocked, it took me a while to process everything,\u201d Joseph said, adding \u201cnow it\u2019s time to bring him home hopefully.\u201d Following an autopsy in Yungay, Stampfl\u2019s body was transferred to the city of Juarez, Joseph explained. Stampfl will be taken to a funeral home in Lima where he will be cremated, and the ashes will be sent to the family in the United States. \u2018A dangerous landscape\u2019 While Cooper is grateful to have finally been able to bring closure to the Stampfl family, the discovery was also tinged with sadness. He had hoped that Richardson\u2019s body might have been attached to Stampfl by a rope, but that was not the case and \u201che\u2019s still missing as of today.\u201d He also fears that global warming may have played a role in his discovery, by thawing the ice on what is considered the world\u2019s highest tropical mountain range. \u201cHe was fully exposed and not in ice anymore. The thawing process happened,\u201d Cooper said. Since the 1950s, almost all of the world\u2019s glaciers have been retreating, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. On average, the glaciers in the Andean region \u2013 Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru \u2013 have lost over 50 per cent of their coverage since the 1960s. \u201cThe Andes is deteriorating more than any other mountain range in the region,\u201d Cooper said, adding that the changing conditions were part of what had prevented him from summiting Mount Huascaran. \u201cGlaciers are melting away, the landscape has changed. It poses a dangerous landscape now,\u201d he said.

Forward Lautaro Martinez, on as a substitute, hit the winner deep into extra time to claim a 1-0 victory for the world champions that ended Colombia\u2019s 28-match unbeaten run and brought Argentina a record 16th Copa Am\u00e9rica crown. It came after a hard-fought game that saw Argentina captain Messi, 37, substituted in the second half with an apparent ankle injury in what is likely to be\u00a0his last game at a major international tournament. The soccer legend was visibly emotional as he watched the game unfold from the bench while nursing his swollen right ankle. But the tears turned to cheers at the final whistle when a hobbling Messi embraced his teammates and coaches with a huge smile before lifting the trophy as jubilant Argentine fans serenaded the champions. The scenes of celebration were the culmination of a chaotic night in Florida, where kick-off at the sold-out 65,300-capacity Hard Rock Stadium was delayed for more than an hour after \u201cthousands of fans without tickets attempted to forcibly enter the stadium,\u201d according to a stadium spokesperson. Photos and video from outside the stadium showed massive overcrowding, with visibly distressed women and children among thousands of fans stuck outside the gates. At least one photo showed fans falling on top of each other at an overturned crush barrier. Video from CNN affiliate\u00a0WSVN also showed some fans climbing the stadium walls in an attempt to gain entry. It is unclear if any fans or security personnel were injured. The gates were later reopened \u201cfor a short period of time to all fans in order to prevent stampedes and serious injury at the perimeter,\u201d the stadium spokesperson said in an update. \u201cThere was serious concern of fans being crushed in an attempt to enter. Law enforcement and security personnel were immediately deployed throughout the stadium and surrounding area to keep fans as safe as possible in light of this unprecedented situation,\u201d the update said. The Miami-Dade Police Department\u00a0said\u00a0several incidents took place as a \u201cresult of unruly behavior and fans trying to access the stadium.\u201d CNN has reached out to the police for more information. In a joint statement, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and chief public safety officer James Reyes said they were \u201coutraged by the unprecedented events\u201d and authorities would investigate what led to the chaos. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: This situation should never have taken place and cannot happen again,\u201d the statement said. The scenes are also likely to cause alarm at soccer\u2019s world governing body FIFA, which has approved the Hard Rock Stadium as a host venue for the 2026 World Cup. The Copa Am\u00e9rica is organized by CONMEBOL, the South American soccer confederation. The disorder in Miami on Sunday comes after Colombia\u2019s semifinal win over Uruguay in Charlotte, North Carolina, was marred by unsavory scenes. Tempers flared Wednesday after a testy match, when players from both squads clashed on the field before live television pictures showed Uruguayan players entering the stands and scuffling with fans.

{"id": "2024_07_10_europe_russia-shadow-war-nato-intl-latam", "text": "Arson at warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine. Surveillance cameras where NATO trains Ukrainian troops. Blunt vandalism of ministerial cars. Even an apparent, failed bomb plot. Russia has been engaged in a \u201cbold\u201d sabotage operation across NATO\u2019s member states for\u00a0more than six\u00a0months, targeting the supply lines of weapons for Ukraine and the decision-makers behind it, according to a senior NATO official. Multiple security officials across Europe describe a threat that is metastasizing as Russian agents, increasingly under scrutiny by security services and\u00a0frustrated in their own operations, hire local amateurs to undertake high-risk, and often deniable, crimes on their behalf. The NATO official said they had observed \u201can unprecedented escalation and spread of Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare\u201d over the past six months, which included \u201cphysical sabotage\u201d on the supply line of NATO weapons intended for Ukraine. \u201cIt is everything from point of production and origin, to storage, to those who are making decisions, to the actual\u00a0delivery,\u201d the\u00a0senior NATO official said. \u201cIt is bold. Russia is attempting to intimidate\u00a0(our)\u00a0allies.\u201d Russia has dismissed the claims as unfounded but\u00a0Russian sabotage and hybrid warfare will be on the agenda of the NATO 75th anniversary meeting in Washington, DC,\u00a0which began Tuesday. Yet it is unclear how publicly member states will express their outrage at what analysts have called the Kremlin\u2019s new \u201cshadow\u00a0war,\u201d as they may be\u00a0reluctant to provide Moscow with a propaganda win, or foment alarm at a series of security breaches across Europe. Recent high-profile arrests have revealed the ad-hoc, clumsy nature of how the Kremlin\u2019s intelligence operations have evolved since the start of the war in\u00a0Ukraine. Last year, 14\u00a0Ukrainians and two Belarusians\u00a0were arrested in Poland in one case on suspicion of\u00a0working for Russian intelligence. A Ukrainian, who under Polish privacy law can be identified only as Maxim L., 24, was sentenced to\u00a0six\u00a0years\u00a0after weeks of receiving tasks from a Russian handler, Andrzej,\u00a0whom he had never physically met but encountered on the Telegram messaging app in February 2023. Andrzej at first paid him $7 in digital currencies for spraying anti-war graffiti around Poland, Maxim said. Yet the tasks soon became darker. \u2018Easy money\u2026 it seemed so insignificant\u2019 In a rare interview with CNN inside the maximum-security wing of Lublin prison, Maxim said he had fled Ukraine to Poland in a frustrated bid to escape\u00a0unemployment and poverty. \u201cIt was easy\u00a0money,\u201d he\u00a0said of the work Andrzej offered. \u201cI needed money badly.\u201d He said he did not feel an obligation to fight for Ukraine after the Russian invasion\u00a0in\u00a0February 2022. \u201cThat country has never done anything for\u00a0me,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that just because you are born in a certain country, you have to go to war for it. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I am not pro-Russian, I am not pro-Ukraine. I am not pro-anything.\u201d Andrzej soon started sending Maxim location pins where he should plant surveillance cameras along the railway tracks near the border town of Medyka, through which military and humanitarian aid would flow to Ukraine. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any of it could cause any actual harm. It seemed so insignificant,\u201d he\u00a0said. Andrzej later asked him to burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company in the eastern Polish town of Biala Podlaska, he said, which Maxim says he faked,\u00a0taking a photograph of the fence with lumps of coal he had placed to mimic fire damage. Yet Maxim\u2019s slow realization that Andrzej was a Russian agent became complete, he said, when he was told to put cameras outside a base where Poland was training Ukrainian soldiers. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew it could be\u00a0serious,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cIt made me feel uneasy. That was when I decided I\u2019d quit. But I never got a chance. I got arrested the\u00a0next day.\u201d Polish internal security agents arrested Maxim on March 3, 2023, after weeks of surveillance, sparked partially by the discovery of a gas station receipt Maxim had accidentally dropped on one of his operations,\u00a0according to a Polish official.\u00a0Multiple other arrests followed this, making it the largest\u00a0known\u00a0Russian espionage operation in Poland of recent times, raising concerns in Warsaw about the extent of Moscow\u2019s infiltration. Two Russian citizens were\u00a0detained\u00a0last August\u00a0on suspicion of\u00a0recruiting to Wagner\u00a0and a Polish\u00a0man and two Belarusians this May for\u00a0alleged\u00a0arson. Another Polish man was arrested in April 2024 for possessing ammunition, and surveilling Rzeszow Jasionka airport, a hub for moving NATO arms to Kyiv, in a suspected plot to assassinate Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also frequently uses the facility. The Polish plots join a series of incidents across Europe which, when viewed together,\u00a0portray\u00a0the widescale ambition of Moscow\u2019s operations.\u00a0Russia was \u201clikely\u201d behind an arson attack that hit Poland\u2019s largest shopping\u00a0center\u00a0in May, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, and suspicions have been voiced about another fire at an ammunition factory, south of the capital, in June. Czech officials have voiced concerns at Russian involvement in the hacking and disruption of its railways last year. Last month, a suspicious fire hit a metals factory for a defense manufacturer outside Berlin, and a\u00a026-year-old\u00a0pro-Russian\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0was arrested after blowing himself up with a\u00a0homemade\u00a0bomb near\u00a0Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.\u00a0A\u00a0warehouse\u00a0fire in East London in March led to\u00a0two men\u00a0being charged by London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service with arson and assisting a foreign intelligence service, namely Russia. While the incidents have not all been definitively linked to Russian intelligence, they have been unified by the apparent involvement of amateurs, or petty criminality aimed at spreading fear or disruption. A \u2018pretty dangerous game\u2019 The senior NATO official said Russian sabotage on NATO states amounted to a \u201cpretty dangerous game, if\u00a0(Russia believes)\u00a0these things are always below the threshold of armed conflict,\u201d that\u00a0would not trigger the NATO\u00a0Article 5\u00a0stipulation that an attack on one member state is an attack on the entire alliance. \u201cFinding where that line is, is a difficult and dangerous calculation to make,\u201d the official said, adding that\u00a0Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u2019s beleaguered invasion of Ukraine shows the Kremlin head was not always getting good military advice. Russia is using the \u201cfull gamut\u201d of hybrid operations, the official added. \u201cWe see everything from high-end operations in Europe, where we have seen as much as 400,000 euros ($433,000) paid for some type of intelligence activity, to some places where thugs are being hired for a couple of thousand\u00a0euros.\u201d A similar threat\u00a0has grown\u00a0on Russia\u2019s border with NATO, in Estonia, where 10\u00a0suspected Russian agents were arrested\u00a0in February after the interior minister\u2019s car was vandalized. The incident was a high-profile peak in what Estonian officials have said is a years-long campaign by Moscow to destabilize its tiny\u00a0NATO\u00a0neighbor, about a fifth\u00a0of whose population of 1.3 million is Russian-speaking,\u00a0according to a 2021 analysis by the EU. Recent months have seen GPS jamming impede civilian aircraft landings, and even the buoys that demark part of Russia\u2019s border with Estonia disappear, amid a short-lived call from Moscow for the maritime frontiers to be reassessed. Harrys Puusepp, a spokesman for the KAPO, Estonia\u2019s internal security service, told CNN that Russian activities had escalated over recent months. \u201cWe saw a significant rise in their activity in the last autumn, and by winter, we were able to apprehend more than\u00a010 (suspects).\u00a0The number has grown by now \u2013 persons who were involved in their hybrid activities against Estonian security \u2013 in a kind that we hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d He said the operations were moving \u201ctowards physical attacks\u201d and suggested the war in Ukraine might lead to more aggressive Russian tactics in the months ahead, if operatives were redeployed to the Baltic areas from the war. \u201cWe have to face the facts. Russia is big enough to have resources to fight a war against Ukraine and also maintain its security operations against European countries\u2026 against us. There are people who take part in the war against Ukraine, and then they are rotated to some other region or area. They have more experience. Their mindset is more violent. They are perhaps not so patient anymore trying to get results.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/europe/russia-shadow-war-nato-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Created as a celebration of women and justice, the statue\u2019s hair was braided into two ram horns (a symbol of strength, according to Madison Square Park\u2019s exhibition guide) and features a large hoop skirt \u2014 inspired by the stained-glass ceiling dome at the courthouse\u00a0\u2014 smattered with shards of painted mosaic pieces: A woman decorated by a broken glass ceiling. But these artistic features, particularly the braided horns and abstract branch-like arms, have drawn criticism and attention. In February, a Texas anti-abortion group called the piece \u2013 which also features an intricate lace collar -\u00a0a \u201csatanic\u201d memorial of the late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and staged a protest demanding the removal of the artwork. The university cancelled an opening celebration of Sikander\u2019s work along with a scheduled talk from the artist. Earlier this week, as Hurricane Beryl moved through Houston, it was revealed that the sculpture had been severely vandalized and the artwork\u2019s head removed, an event Sikander believes was captured on surveillance cameras.

Sikorski explained that some missiles fired from around St. Petersburg fly along the Polish border through Belarusian airspace, before briefly entering Polish airspace for about 40 seconds before hitting targets inside Ukraine. \u201cOur dilemma is the following: if we shoot them down only when they enter our airspace, the debris is a threat to our citizens and to our property,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Ukrainians are saying, \u2018Please, we will not mind, do it over our airspace when they\u2019re in imminent danger of crossing into Polish territory,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cTo my mind, that\u2019s self-defense but we are exploring the idea.\u201d Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Warsaw to sign a security cooperation agreement between the two countries.

Earlier in the day, Carlos Alcaraz won his second consecutive Wimbledon title after dismantling Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the final on Centre Court, a victory that was followed up by the men\u2019s national soccer team deservedly beating England 2-1 in the Euro 2024 final. Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI and his daughter Infanta Sof\u00eda joined the team in the celebrations on the pitch, holding the trophy with Spanish squad. Several of the Spanish national team\u2019s legends were also in attendance to celebrate the country\u2019s record-breaking fourth European Championship.

{"id": "2024_07_14_world_king-charles-australia-samoa-visit-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s King Charles III and Queen Camilla are planning to head down under. The royal couple will travel to Australia in October as part of a tour that will also see them visit Samoa for this year\u2019s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Buckingham Palace announced on Sunday. The forthcoming visit to Australia will be the 75-year-old British monarch\u2019s first trip to a Commonwealth realm since he ascended the throne. In addition to the United Kingdom, Charles is also head of state in 14 realms including Australia, New Zealand and Canada, though his role is largely ceremonial. Charles and Camilla are visiting the nation \u201cat the invitation of the Australian government, where their program will feature engagements in the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales,\u201d the palace said. He last visited Australia with his wife six years ago, when they traveled to the Gold Coast for the opening of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings \u2013 or CHOGM as they are known \u2013 are held every two years, with member states taking turns as host.\u00a0The theme of this year\u2019s event in Samoa, Charles\u2019 first as head of the organization, is \u201cOne Resilient Future: Transforming Our Common Wealth,\u201d and will see delegations from the 56 member states come together. \u201cTheir majesties\u2019 state visit to Samoa will celebrate the strong bilateral relationship between the Pacific Island nation and the UK,\u201d the palace added. Charles, who resumed public-facing duties in April as he continues his treatment for cancer, has had a busy calendar in recent months. Last month, he attended D-Day commemorations in France. More recently, he appointed Keir Starmer as prime minister after the Labour Party won a landslide victory at the polls, traveled to Scotland for the annual \u201cHolyrood Week\u201d celebrating Scottish culture and on Thursday visited the Welsh parliament in Cardiff to mark 25 years since Welsh devolution. On Monday, the royal couple are headed to the Channel Islands for a two-day visit. Further details on the king and queen\u2019s tours are expected to be revealed in the coming months. However, a palace spokesperson said that similarly to all of Charles\u2019s recent engagements, \u201chis program in both countries will be subject to doctors\u2019 advice, and any necessary modifications on health grounds.\u201d Some may wonder why the royal couple are not going to New Zealand while they are in the region. The palace spokesperson said that decision was made in consultation with the king\u2019s medical team who advised that \u201csuch an extended program should be avoided at this time\u201d in order to prioritize his continued recovery. \u201cIn close consultation with the Australian and New Zealand prime ministers, and with due regard for the pressures of time and logistics, it has therefore been agreed to limit the visit to Samoa and Australia only,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cTheir majesties send their warmest thanks and good wishes to all parties for their continued support and understanding,\u201d they added. The king\u2019s absence from undertaking any visits to any of the Commonwealth realms since his accession had raised eyebrows. There was much surprise when his first overseas tours as monarch were announced as France and Germany. Those were followed by travel to Kenya, which is a Commonwealth member but not a realm. Charles\u2019 visit to Australia will be a key test of his popularity as head of state. The nation \u2013 which was colonized by the British in 1788 \u2013 has long debated whether a long-distance monarch is still needed. A 1999 referendum on the issue saw voters opt to remain a constitutional monarchy, 55% to 45%. In other Commonwealth nations, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death renewed rumblings \u2013 some louder than others \u2013 of moves to sever ties with the crown and become republics. But in Australia, despite Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s pro-republic views, there has been no immediate push in that direction. Albanese had proposed to hold a referendum over whether the nation should become a republic if he secured a second term in 2025. However, those plans appear to have been shelved to focus on more pressing challenges at home like the cost-of-living crisis.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/world/king-charles-australia-samoa-visit-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Aiming farther afield, the weapons officers on the four-engine aircraft, nicknamed Ghostrider, can pick out objects at 50,000 feet, almost 10 miles away \u2013 all potential targets for the biggest gun ever mounted on a fixed-wing plane. CNN got an exclusive look inside the aircraft, assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command, in early June after it flew from its home base in Hurlburt Field, Florida, for joint drills in South Korea. In a live-fire exercise, the 105-millimeter howitzer pumped out 43-pound shells, into a firing range east of Seoul, the force of each blast so powerful that it pushed the tail of the 80-ton plane six feet to the right. About eight seconds after firing, the shells hit the range 10,000 feet below, sending smoke billowing skyward as the controllers of the big gun watched the results of their handiwork on large video screens in the middle of the aircraft. \u201cAssess two tanks destroyed,\u201d a scratchy voice confirms in the radio headsets of the AC-130 crew. Pilot Capt. John Ikenberry said the AC-130\u2019s presence for drills in South Korea was designed to send a simple message to its belligerent neighbor North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. \u201cIt shows we are ready,\u201d Ikenberry said. Tensions have been simmering on the peninsula in recent months. The North has been sending balloons filled with trash to areas in and near Seoul and testing missiles, and South Korean troops have fired warning shots as North Korean soldiers from the North have crossed the military demarcation line in the middle of the demilitarized zone. Just this week, North Korea criticized live-fire exercises in the South in late June and early July as an \u201c\u2018inexcusable and explicit provocation.\u201d Meanwhile, Washington has kept a steady stream of hardware heading to the South for land, air and sea exercises leading up to one of their biggest yearly exercises, Ulchi Freedom Shield, set to begin later this summer. Experience they can\u2019t get stateside The AC-130J, the newest version of the US Air Force Hercules gunships, is testing its mettle in Korea for the second year in a row. Maj. Heath Curtis, combat systems officer on the Hercules, says it\u2019s important for the gunship to make the flight across the Pacific because it offers experience training where a conflict could be fought with conditions that can\u2019t be duplicated on firing ranges in Florida or New Mexico that the gunship would use in the United States. The mountain ranges and ridges of the Korean Peninsula present wind conditions not found elsewhere, he says, and that can make a difference even to a projectile traveling more than 800 mph. It also gives the chance for Curtis and a second officer seated at AC-130\u2019s weapons control center the chance to practice alongside South Korean allies they may need to protect in the event of a ground war on the peninsula. The huge television monitors bring the battlefield below up close in both regular and infrared definition. The cameras mounted outside the plane can zoom in on details to ensure weapons fire is accurate. \u201cThe unique thing about the AC-130 is the amount of fire that we bring, the amount of munitions \u2013 the diverse amount of them \u2013 and the amount of loiter time we can provide,\u201d says the mission commander for this gunship, Maj. Josh Burris. Besides the 105-millimeter howitzer, the AC-130J carries a 30-millimeter cannon and can launch precision-guided missiles and bombs from pylons on its wings. With the weapons\u2019 near-pinpoint accuracy, it can fire on enemy positions within shouting distance of friendly troops, earning the aircraft the title of \u201cthe infantryman\u2019s best friend\u201d in some circles. And with air-to-air refueling, it can, in theory, stay on station supporting ground forces as long as the crew and ammunition can last. \u2018Spooky\u2019 history US Air Force gunships trace their lineage back to the Vietnam War, when the service set up 7.62 mm guns to fire out one side of a C-47 transport aircraft. With that configuration, the aircraft could circle a single point and deliver massive, continuous firepower on it, from its guns that could fire 6,000 rounds in a minute, according to Air Force fact sheets. The firepower and the flares they used to light up targets during night missions earned them the nicknames \u201cSpooky\u201d and \u201cPuff the Magic Dragon.\u201d As the war went on, the Air Force looked for a heavier airframe for the gunship role and turned to C-130 Hercules transports. The first conversion of a C-130 to an AC-130 saw action over Southeast Asia in 1967, according to the National Museum of the US Air Force. With their ability to support troops in close combat, AC-130 gunships in different variations have seen action in conflicts including Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan and have saved an untold number of lives, according to the Air Force. With the AC-130J model, introduced in 2017, the Air Force removed the machine guns in favor of the more precision-guided munitions. But there have been problems, too, including a 2015 attack on a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, that killed left 42 patients, staff and caretakersdead. Despite the formidable firepower it carries, the AC-130 flies low and slow, making it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. And seven AC-130 gunships have been lost over the years, the last being on January 31, 1991, when an Iraqi surface-to-air missile brought down a AC-130H during Operation Desert Storm, according to Air Force news releases. The plane crashed into the Persian Gulf while supporting US Marines during a battle in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, killing all 14 crew aboard. The AC-130\u2019s crew acknowledges the dangers of ground fire to their aircraft, and some analysts question its usefulness in any potential conflict with North Korea. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t be operated within say 100 nautical miles of the border as they\u2019re too vulnerable to North Korean border air defenses,\u201d says Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. But Layton says the gunships could be helpful supporting allied troops who might be trying to round up North Korean special forces units that had managed to infiltrate deeper into southern territory. Still, he cautioned, \u201cif a war starts there, try not to be on an AC-130 unless it\u2019s heading out of theater.\u201d Maj. Christopher Mesnard, Special Operations Command Korea public affairs director, said the AC-130J is a suitable weapon system for the Korean Peninisula. \u201cWe have the utmost confidence in our ability to operate weapons systems\u00a0\u200blike the AC-130J in times and places of our choosing and in a way that adequately considers risks, regardless of the region,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_11_asia_south-korea-antidrone-lasers-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "South Korea is beginning the mass production of a low-cost laser weapon that has successfully shot down small drones during testing, the country\u2019s key arms agency said Thursday. The laser weapon, called Block-I, \u201ccan precisely strike small unmanned aerial vehicles and multicopters at close range,\u201d a news release from South Korea\u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said. The release did not give a cost for the weapon, but said each shot fired would only cost about $1.50. Imagery supplied by the agency appears to show a weapon around the size of a shipping container with a laser mounted on top and what appears to be a radar or tracking device mounted on one side of the platform. DAPA said the unit measures 9 meters by 3 meters by 3 meters (29.5 feet by 9.8 feet by 9.8 feet), and fires laser rays that are difficult if not impossible to detect before impact. \u201cIt is invisible and noiseless, does not require separate ammunition and can be operated only when electricity is supplied,\u201d the DAPA release said. Future versions could be developed to take out much bigger targets, including aircraft and ballistic missiles, which would be a potential \u201cgame changer,\u201d according to the release. DAPA will develop \u201ca laser anti-aircraft weapon (Block-II) system with improved output and range compared to the current one,\u201d the release said. But the Block-I weapon itself comes online at an important time. In Ukraine, the Middle East and elsewhere, small drones - some available off the shelf - have shown the ability to disable or destroy multimillion-dollar pieces of military hardware, including tanks. Militaries have typically responded by trying to take out low-cost drones with defensive systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars per strike. A weapon that could do the same for practically pennies would be a big boost to the country that can deploy it. \u201cLow-cost drones and rockets have swung the economic calculus of offense and defense in favor of those using large volumes of cheap unmanned systems and munitions to overwhelm more-sophisticated air and missile defenses,\u201d James Black, assistant director defense and security for the RAND Europe think tank, wrote in a blog post in January. DAPA said the Block-I weapon has been in development for five years, with more than $63 million invested. The Korea Institute for Defense Analyses led the system development with participation from Hanwha Aerospace, it said. The system was evaluated suitable for combat in April 2023 after achieving 100% success in shooting down targets in live-fire tests, according to DAPA. The agency said South Korea is the first country to publicly acknowledge it will deploy a mass-produced laser weapon. Earlier this year, Britain showed off a new laser weapon that its military says could deliver lethal missile or aircraft defense at around $13 a shot. But no possible deployment date for that weapon had been announced. In 2022, the US Navy successfully tested a high-energy laser system against a target representing a cruise missile. But a Navy account of that test said there was no plan to get it into the hands of warfighters, adding that it \u201coffers a glimpse into the future of laser weapons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/asia/south-korea-antidrone-lasers-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

As temperatures rise, CNN is tracking extreme heat conditions and the potential risk for Americans each day. To help prepare Americans for the dangerous temperatures, the National Weather Service and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this year released a new national forecast predicting heat-related risks. It considers the severity and unusualness of forecast heat and its potential duration, while also factoring the likely impact on residents in specific locations based on CDC data for past effects, such as deaths. This map shows the latest forecast. A large slice of the American population lives in places that will be subject to heat advisories, warnings and watches from National Weather Service this summer. More than 60 million people, on average, endured such conditions from June 21 to Sept. 22, 2023, according to data released by the service. This chart shows that population each day during the last month. As the planet warms, heat waves are now more common, intense and long-lasting, and temperatures\u00a0are warming even faster overnight \u2014 not cooling down enough to offer relief. As those temperatures rise, heat records will also fall. The weather service each day releases a forecast for potential record-breaking temperatures, by location, across the country.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "All five Americans arrested in recent months in Turks and Caicos under gun control laws that make bringing firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police a crime has been sentenced. Michael Lee Evans, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, of Oklahoma; and Tyler Wenrich, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. All have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers who went to the British Overseas Territory in May as part of efforts to petition for their expedited release. Though the infractions had carried a mandatory 12-year prison sentence and fine \u2013 with reductions only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2013 a mid-June revision clarified courts may impose a fine, a custodial sentence or both in exceptional circumstances, a member of the territory\u2019s House of Assembly said June 14. All five Americans arrested under the law have pleaded guilty, been sentenced and returned to the US. Here\u2019s what we know about the laws in Turks and Caicos and the affected Americans: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased \u2013 and that\u2019s a worry, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, taking firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The mandatory sentence was in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam has said, adding judges could use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said: \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly.\u201d Even so, the \u201camendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity,\u201d House of Assembly member\u00a0Edwin\u00a0Astwood said in a statement. \u201cThis often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender.\u201d US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick has said, and none got a 12-year sentence. While Turks and Caicos collaborates with the US in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was sentenced July 11 to a suspended\u00a023-week sentence and fined $1,500 following her\u00a0arrest in mid-May, her attorney Sheena C. Mair\u00a0confirmed to CNN. Grier planned to pay the fine and board a same-day flight from\u00a0Turks\u00a0and Caicos to the United States, Mair said. She arrived in Florida later that evening, CNN affiliate WKMG reported. \u201cIf she behaves for 12 months, nothing will happen. But if she gets in trouble in (Turks and Caicos) in those 12 months, she will serve 23 weeks,\u201d the attorney told CNN. Grier told WKMG her ordeal was \u201can emotional rollercoaster.\u201d \u201cI had ups and downs. Some days, I\u2019d be OK. The next day, I\u2019m down,\u201d she said. Grier offered a warning to travelers: \u201cBe very careful because other countries got different laws than we do, so that\u2019s very serious.\u201d The Florida mother had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said in May. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier had been released on bail but couldn\u2019t leave the island until her case concluded and had to report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said in May. Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to the United States after he received a suspended 52-week sentence in late May, which meant he didn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He got home May 24, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. Arriving at Pittsburgh International Airport, Hagerich told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife had packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home \u2013 they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark; you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced May 28 to three weeks time-served in jail and fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, a Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands spokesperson said that day in a statement. He returned home to Virginia on May 30. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9 mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. He was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation and to attend his June sentencing hearing virtually, said his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel. Evans got a suspended 33-month sentence, and his attorney believes it is unlikely he will have to serve time in jail. \u201cIf he has no problems in (Turks and Caicos) within 12 months, he will not have to do any time,\u201d Smith told CNN on June 24. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays when he was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. He plead guilty in May. The first of the Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, he got a suspended 13-week sentence and a $2,000 fine, or $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on June 21. Watson soon returned home and reunited with his family, US Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said on X. US lawmakers tried to free Americans The Americans\u2019 arrest has stoked tension between US officials and their counterparts just a few hundred miles away. A request by a US congressional delegation to the islands in May for charges against the five Americas to be dropped did not yield the desired result. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Republican US Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said May 20 in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully (in) Turks and Caicos,\u201d Republican US Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler told ABC News the same week. Meanwhile, the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the United Nations for humanitarian concerns, Reschenthaler told CNN. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler, for his part, wanted to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States,\u201d the congressman told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on May 20. \u201cThey were innocent mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On May 28, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, calling it \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_11_tech_apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets", "text": "Apple has yielded to pressure by European regulators to give rivals access to the contactless payments technology on iPhones, meaning that their users will no longer be limited to the Apple Pay mobile wallet. The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_middleeast_israel-gaza-netzah-yehuda-human-rights-abuses-investigation-intl", "text": "Former commanders of the Netzah Yehuda battalion, an Israeli military unit that has been accused by the United States of gross human rights violations against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank prior to October 7, have been promoted to senior positions in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and are now active in training Israeli ground troops as well as running operations in Gaza, a CNN investigation has found. Among CNN\u2019s findings was rare whistleblower testimony from a former soldier of the unit who described a command that encouraged a culture of violence, an issue identified by US State Department investigations. In April, the State Department said that it had determined five Israeli security units had committed gross violations of human rights prior to the outbreak of the war with Hamas in Gaza. The department said that four of the units had \u201ceffectively remediated,\u201d or reformed themselves, in the wake of those violations, but that it was still deciding whether to restrict US military assistance to the remaining unit: The Netzah Yehuda battalion, originally created to accommodate ultra-Orthodox Jews in the military. The news that the US might withhold assistance from the Israeli military unit triggered a furious response at the time from top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said: \u201cIf anyone thinks they can impose sanctions on a unit of the IDF, I will fight with all my strength.\u201d In a letter obtained by CNN, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told House Speaker Mike Johnson that the US was working with Israel \u201con identifying a path to effective remediation\u201d for the Netzah Yehuda battalion. The letter did not name the unit, but current and former US officials confirmed to CNN that Blinken was referring to Netzah Yehuda, which has been accused of a string of abuses in the occupied West Bank over the last 10 years, including in the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian-American man in 2022. Using facial recognition technology and other open-source techniques, CNN has found that three former commanders of the Netzah Yehuda battalion \u2013 who were in charge of the unit at the time of alleged abuses in the West Bank \u2013 have risen through the ranks of the IDF. CNN tracked these commanders by matching their faces to publicly available imagery over the years, ranging from photographs of military ceremonies to battlefield updates. CNN has spoken with a former member of the unit, who detailed instances of cruel and excessively violent treatment of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. The whistleblower said that commanders actively supported vigilante violence and that promoting them into senior IDF positions risked bringing the same culture to other parts of the military. \u201cA lot of us probably did not see Arabs, Palestinians in particular, as someone with rights \u2013 okay, like they\u2019re really the occupier of some of the land and they need to be moved,\u201d he said. The former soldier, who asked not to be named due to fears about his security, told CNN that the unit was well known for carrying out what he described as the \u201ccollective punishment of Palestinians.\u201d He gave an example of the battalion\u2019s forces assaulting a Palestinian village, going door-to-door with stun grenades and gas grenades as retribution for some local children throwing rocks. While he was in Netzah Yehuda, he said, the battalion\u2019s commanders played a key role in perpetuating a culture of violence, both by standing by as it happened and promoting it. Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the allegations of abuse by Netzah Yehuda, the IDF said that the battalion \u201coperates in a professional and ethical manner\u201d and that its soldiers and commanders \u201cact according to the orders and protocols expected of soldiers in the IDF.\u201d The IDF added that it investigates \u201cevery exceptional incident,\u201d and takes command and disciplinary measures against those involved when appropriate. It did not comment on the subsequent promotion of some commanders. In the course of its month-long investigation, CNN spoke with several current and former US officials, who revealed the intense frustrations within the Biden administration at the perceived special treatment that Israel receives from the US when it comes to addressing human rights violations by its security forces. The former US officials said the fact that Netzah Yehuda\u2019s former commanders have continued to be promoted through Israel\u2019s military ranks was a worrying result of America\u2019s inaction and could have devastating consequences. The US determined that four of the five Israeli units under scrutiny were remediated on the basis that Israel had taken steps to \u201cbring to justice\u201d responsible service members, according to an internal memo sent by the State Department to Congress and obtained by CNN. Israeli military veterans from Breaking the Silence, an anti-occupation advocacy group, told CNN that the IDF often scapegoats junior soldiers or officers, arguing that abuses are the fault of a few bad apples rather than reflective of institutional problems stemming from longstanding military practices or government policies. That approach should not meet the bar for effective remediation, US officials said. A State Department spokesperson told CNN that they do not discuss the circumstances of individual cases, but its experts had \u201cconcluded that several Israeli security force units were credibly implicated in gross violations of human rights (GVHRs),\u201d and that for four of those, the Israeli government had \u201ctaken effective steps to bring those responsible to justice.\u201d \u201cWe continue to assess reports of GVHRs by Israeli security forces, in accordance with the law, and all US security assistance to Israel is provided consistent with domestic and international law,\u201d the spokesperson added. Current and former US officials also told CNN that the five Israeli units were not the only ones the State Department had been examining. The special State Department panel had reached unanimous consensus at a working level that three additional units had been guilty of abuses prior to October 7, the officials said. Only Blinken or the Deputy Secretary of State can make a final determination on whether units remain eligible to receive US military assistance and it is unclear if the matter has come before them. The findings by the expert panel would have been enough to disqualify a military unit from any other country, the officials said. The incidents include the killing of Ahmad Jamil Fahd, who was allegedly shot by forces from the Israeli police counterterrorism unit, the Yamam, near Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, in May 2021; the killing of a Bedouin man identified as Sanad Salaam al-Harbad, who was allegedly shot by the Israel Border Police in the southern Israeli city of Rahat in March 2022; and the alleged rape of a 15-year-old boy by an interrogator from the Israeli Internal Security Forces at the Russian Compound (Moscobiyya detention center) in Jerusalem in January 2021. One US official CNN spoke with said these were among \u201cthe most flagrant abuses looked into.\u201d CNN reached out to the Israel Border Police and Shin Bet, the country\u2019s domestic security agency, for comment on the State Department\u2019s findings. Josh Paul, who as a former director in the State Department\u2019s political-military affairs bureau spent more than 11 years working on US defense diplomacy, security and weapons assistance before resigning in October 2023 over the transfer of arms to Israel, told CNN that there was \u201cnot even the slightest basis\u201d to suggest that the three further units identified to CNN \u2014 the Yamam, the Israel Border Police and Internal Security Forces connected to the Moscobiyya detention center \u2014 had done anything to reform. Paul had previously referenced the Moscobiyya rape allegation in an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, adding that a charity had drawn it to the attention of a State Department vetting panel he was on. The allegation was believed to be credible and raised with Israel\u2019s government, he said. \u201cAnd do you know what happened the next day? The IDF went in to the (charity\u2019s) offices and removed all their computers and declared them a terrorist entity,\u201d he told Amanpour. Two of the units have been linked to deadly incidents in the wake of October 7. The Yamam was involved in Israel\u2019s hostage rescue operation in Nuseirat refugee camp, in northern Gaza, on June 8, which freed four Israelis and, according to local health authorities, killed more than 270 Palestinians and injured over 700. The IDF has disputed those numbers, claiming that casualties from the operation were \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the casualty figures given by either side. Meanwhile, the Israel Border Police shot and killed a 3-year-old Palestinian girl in the occupied West Bank in January and a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in occupied east Jerusalem in March. The fact that the US has never imposed sanctions on any Israeli military unit shows \u201cthe lack of political will and moral courage to hold Israel accountable,\u201d Paul added. \u2018Culture of impunity\u2019 The US is by far the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, and its military assistance has helped shape Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza. But it has increasingly come under international pressure over its support as the war drags on. Nine months since Hamas militants killed around 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped more than 250 people, Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. US President Joe Biden has called for the war to end, and laid out a US-backed Israeli ceasefire proposal, but his administration has continued to supply Israel with billions of dollars\u2019 worth of weapons. Paul told CNN that Israel\u2019s prosecution of the war in Gaza would look far different if the US had enforced legislation known as the Leahy law. The 1997 law, named for former Sen. Patrick Leahy who authored the legislation, prohibits the US from providing assistance to any foreign security units that are credibly implicated in human rights violations. \u201cHad the US used the leverage that Leahy laws provide over the years to encourage the IDF to crack down on misbehavior and to snuff out its current culture of impunity, we would have seen at the very least a much stronger unit discipline (than what we see in Gaza right now) at a tactical level,\u201d said Paul, who was a member of the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum \u2013 created in 2020 to identify Israeli units that should be barred from receiving US aid. Under the Leahy law, in cases where an entire unit is designated to receive assistance, the State Department vets not only the unit but also its commander. Charles Blaha, the former director of the State Department\u2019s Office of Security and Human Rights, and also a former member of the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum, said that the panel pays \u201cspecial attention\u201d to commanders. \u201cThey set the tone for the units. When a commander from a tainted unit goes on to another unit, he can render the new unit ineligible for US assistance too,\u201d said Blaha, who retired from the State Department last year. \u2018Moral failure\u2019 The Netzah Yehuda battalion was created by the Israeli military in 1999 for ultra-Orthodox Jews, to accommodate their more stringent religious practices, like the separation of men and women. Since it was established, the battalion has also attracted religious nationalists from the West Bank settler movement, according to those familiar with the unit. It forms part of the Kfir Brigade, the largest infantry brigade in the IDF. One of the most shocking and widely reported incidents involving the Netzah Yehuda battalion was the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian-American man, who was detained in his home village of Jiljilya in the occupied West Bank in January 2022. Omar Assad was held gagged and with his hands tied for a period before being freed and left unresponsive by soldiers from the unit, according to an IDF investigation. An autopsy report determined that Assad had died from a heart attack after he was detained. The IDF investigation concluded that the incident resulted from \u201ca moral failure and poor decision-making on the part of the soldiers.\u201d Following the initial probe, the IDF said that it would reprimand the commander of Netzah Yehuda \u2013 Lt. Col. Mati Shevach \u2013 and remove the platoon commander and company commander from their positions, barring them from commanding roles for two years. But no criminal charges were brought against the soldiers, because the military said there was no causal link found between Assad\u2019s death and their conduct. The IDF referred CNN to its findings when questioned about Assad\u2019s death. Current and former US officials told CNN that the Assad case reflects a broader trend of the types of cases that the US examines. To date, the only incidents in which the US has implicated Israeli units in gross human rights violations were cases in which Israeli courts had already ruled. \u201cThe State Department has never made an independent determination of a gross violation of human rights by an Israeli unit. Ever,\u201d Blaha said. Speaking further about the special treatment that Israel gets from the US, he added: \u201cOf course, we treat Israel differently and that really undermines our human rights advocacy in the rest of the world.\u201d Shevach, Netzah Yehuda\u2019s commander at the time of Assad\u2019s death, was promoted to the role of deputy commander of the Kfir Brigade, which oversees Netzah Yehuda, soon after his two-year stint in charge of the ultra-Orthodox battalion ended in August 2022. And now, Shevach is training soldiers who are about to enter combat, according to an IDF press release and media reports. Shevach has been running drills for Israeli forces at the military\u2019s Urban Warfare Training Center, a mock city in Tze\u2019elim military base in the Negev desert, preparing them to go into Gaza. In an October interview with US broadcaster CBS at the center, Shevach explained how he was readying soldiers to fight Hamas, adding that \u201cthe major concern for most of the soldiers\u201d was that at a certain point they would get \u201can order that the war ends, and we didn\u2019t finish our mission.\u201d CNN put its findings on Shevach\u2019s career trajectory to Blaha, who said that it \u201cstrongly suggests that the types of tactics, the types of abuses, the type of violations that the Netzah Yehuda have committed are going to metastasize to the new units because if that person is in charge of training, he is going to promulgate the same lack of ethos regarding human rights.\u201d CNN found that two other commanders who oversaw Netzah Yehuda \u2013 also known as the 97th Battalion of the Kfir Infantry Brigade \u2013 at the time of alleged abuses in the occupied West Bank were also promoted. Lt. Col. Nitai Okashi oversaw the Netzah Yehuda battalion from 2018 to 2020. In January 2019, soldiers from his unit were captured on video beating and taunting a Palestinian father and son after their arrest in the occupied West Bank. Four were later convicted of aggravated abuse. Okashi, according to Israeli media reports, asked the judge for mercy, saying the soldiers had learned their lesson. In another incident, in October 2019, 14 soldiers from his unit were arrested, according to the Israeli military, after they were caught on video assaulting Bedouin men at a gas station in the West Bank. Since leaving the battalion, Okashi has been promoted into a number of commanding roles in the IDF. He has operated in Gaza since the beginning of the war as the commander of the Jerusalem Brigade and taken reporters from international media, such as German magazine Der Spiegel and Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper on military embeds into the strip. The IDF announced a further promotion for Okashi in March. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc Lt. Col. Uri Levy was in charge of Netzah Yehuda from 2014 to 2016. During that time, a Netzah Yehuda soldier was indicted for abuse under aggravated circumstances by a military court in Israel, after he allegedly administered electric shocks to Palestinian suspects in two separate incidents in October 2015. After leaving the unit, Levy was promoted to work in the Kfir Brigade. Levy retired from the military in 2023 and now regularly appears on Israeli talk shows as a pundit. In April, when news broke that the US could be poised to sanction Netzah Yehuda, he told Israeli Channel 7: \u201cAnyone looking to find some kind of flaw in an IDF unit like this can find it, and I suggest looking at the glass half full \u2026 the operational successes, the achievements, the hard work night after night.\u201d CNN reached out to the IDF for comment on the alleged abuses carried out by Netzah Yehuda over the past decade. In response, the IDF said: \u201cIt should be noted that in relation to the events that took place in 2015 and 2019 \u2026 the involved had been indicted and the military court had imposed prison sentences in both cases, along with additional punishments.\u201d Men forced to strip naked In late 2022, Netzah Yehuda, which had been stationed in the occupied West Bank since its inception, was reassigned to the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The IDF said it was an extended operational deployment, but Blinken, in his letter to Speaker Johnson, wrote that it was an acknowledgement that the battalion had \u201cengaged in conduct inconsistent with IDF rules.\u201d Still, that track record has not stopped the IDF from deploying Netzah Yehuda soldiers to Gaza, where they have been fighting since the start of the war. On April 16, under the leadership of then-commander Lt. Col. Shlomo Shiran, Netzah Yehuda was involved in an operation at the Mahdiyya Al-Shawwa school in Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, where thousands of displaced Palestinians were sheltering, according to eyewitnesses, local journalists and IDF statements. Eyewitnesses said that the soldiers surrounded the school, \u201cfired excessively\u201d on the complex and forced men to strip naked before detaining them. The IDF said intelligence indicated Hamas fighters were in the area. A voice note allegedly recorded by Palestinians inside the school as the attack unfolded, obtained by CNN, captured panic as the civilians remained trapped inside and gunshots rang out. A video posted on social media showed a Palestinian man forced to strip naked in front of an IDF tank. The IDF did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the incident. In turning a blind eye and failing to take action against Netzah Yehuda and other units in the past, Paul said that the US has contributed to a continuing culture of impunity whose \u201ceffects we see in every outrageous TikTok video recorded and published by Israeli soldiers on the ground as they plunder, pillage, and mock their way across Gaza.\u201d That Netzah Yehuda has been allowed to fight in Gaza after having been pulled from the occupied West Bank in the wake of violent incidents is \u201cironic\u201d and concerning, the whistleblower who served in the Netzah Yehuda told CNN. In the strip, he said: \u201cThey pretty much get a carte blanche, where they can do more or less whatever they want.\u201d In the rare interview, he told CNN that he has felt compelled to speak out about the mistreatment of Palestinians by the force after reflecting on his time as a soldier. After he joined the unit at age 19, he recalled, he heard about soldiers being rewarded for killings. \u201cIf you kill a terrorist, you get two weeks off as a compensation \u2026 which is quite an attractive reward for someone that\u2019s spending a lot of time in the military,\u201d he said. The IDF said in a statement to CNN that the claim soldiers are rewarded with early leave for killing terrorists was \u201cfalse and baseless.\u201d \u201cSoldiers are going to do what their commander is expecting them to do and follow orders. And so, if these commanders don\u2019t put their foot down and punish them for their behavior, then they are in fact condoning their behavior,\u201d the whistleblower said. But, he added, \u201cMost of the commanders couldn\u2019t care less (about abuses), as long as it didn\u2019t end up on video.\u201d Credits Investigative Reporter: Katie PolglaseInvestigative Producer & Writer: Pallabi MunsiInvestigative Producer: Benjamin BrownExecutive Producer: Barbara ArvanitidisSenior Photojournalist: Alex PlattInvestigative Video Editor: Mark BaronSenior Digital Video Producer: Augusta AnthonyVisual Editor: Alberto MierPhoto Editor: Toby HancockOSINT Editor: Gianluca MezzofioreFeatures Editor: Laura Smith-SparkSenior Investigations Editor: Eliza MackintoshExecutive Editors: Dan Wright & Matt Wells Ami Kaufman and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/israel-gaza-netzah-yehuda-human-rights-abuses-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
