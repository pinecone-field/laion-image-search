{"id": "style_dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc", "text": "Not content with Dubai having the tallest building, the deepest pool or the highest hotel, urban design firm URB hopes to add one more superlative feather to the city\u2019s cap: the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway. URB has released conceptual designs for a 64-kilometer-long highway that would see Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road, one of the city\u2019s main traffic belts, transformed into a \u201cGreen Spine,\u201d complete with autonomous, solar-powered trams and smart traffic management. Baharash Bagherian, urban planner and founder of URB, believes the \u201cfirst-of-its-kind project\u201d would make the city\u2019s design more \u201chuman-centric.\u201d \u201cDubai is rapidly expanding, with its population expected to nearly double to 8 million by 2040,\u201d Bagherian told CNN in an email. \u201cThis growth necessitates creativity and innovation to address both current and future challenges.\u201d \u201cWe must view mobility as more than just the movement of people,\u201d he added. Smart tech and solar-power The autonomous solar-powered tram is just one aspect of the proposed highway\u2019s transport system: above the tram line, a network of green areas, parks and overpasses would increase connectivity and walkability of the city, which is currently tough to navigate on foot. The highway would also integrate smart technology, such as \u201cinternet of things\u201d (IoT) sensors, to manage traffic and optimize energy use. Bagherian\u2019s designs allow for 300-megawatt solar panels and a storage system to be embedded in the tracks, that would power the tram line, as well as generate clean energy for an estimated 130,000 homes. And the green spaces \u2014 including parks and community gardens \u2014 would provide space for one million trees, which would also help cool the city and improve air quality. \u2018A unique set of challenges\u2019 Creating the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway in a desert city isn\u2019t easy, though. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) already has one of the world\u2019s highest water consumption rates per capita, consuming around 550 liters per person, per day (compared to an average of 310 liters in the US, 150 liters in Hong Kong, and 144 liters in the European Union). Most of this isn\u2019t used as drinking water, but in agriculture and landscaping, and the country\u2019s green spaces use copious amounts of water. For example, Dubai Miracle Garden \u2014 a 72,000-square-meter park displaying 150 million live flowers \u2014\u00a0consumes 757,000 liters (200,000 US gallons) of water every day. \u201cDubai presents a unique set of challenges: its rapid growth, diverse population, urban sprawl, and extreme climate conditions,\u201d Bagherian said. To combat this, Bagherian\u2019s concept includes \u201cwater-sensitive landscape design\u201d that includes native flora and drought-resistant plants suited to the arid climate, and soil mixed with zeolite, an absorbent crystal that aids water retention. These \u201cpassive techniques\u201d are complemented with smart irrigation technology, he added, \u201cwhich use real-time data to adjust watering schedules based on soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and plant needs.\u201d An urban utopia This isn\u2019t URB\u2019s first foray into utopian future city design. Its proposal for \u201cDubai Mangroves\u201d \u2014 which it claims will be \u201cworld\u2019s largest coastal regeneration project\u201d if it goes ahead \u2014 was revealed earlier this year, and last year, it also proposed a 93-kilometer indoor cycling \u201csuperhighway\u201d called The Loop that could help residents in the emirate go car-free. Like the Green Spine, none of these designs have been confirmed. But Bagherian says that turning these conceptual designs into a reality isn\u2019t as tough as it looks. \u201cWhen you break down the components of the project, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s nothing new from a technological, structural, or material standpoint,\u201d he said, adding that the innovation lies in how these technologies are \u201ccreatively and seamlessly integrated to address multiple needs.\u201d The next step involves getting public sector entities onboard, to provide \u201cthe necessary support, regulatory framework, and infrastructure integration to bring this ambitious project to life,\u201d Bagherian said. He\u2019s optimistic that this will happen, as the project aligns with the government\u2019s 2040 Urban Master Plan, and creative urban planning is key to fulfilling those goals. \u201cDubai is uniquely positioned to make this project a reality,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_13_europe_paris-olympics-sex-education-pleasure-spt-intl", "text": "The City of Love has a message as it prepares for the Olympics: Performance is not always the priority. Rather, when it comes to sex, pleasure takes first place. As Paris starts welcoming athletes to the Olympic Village in the coming days, organizers of the 2024 Games are set to launch a comprehensive sexual health campaign that champions pleasure and consent as well as the traditional emphasis on safety. It is an important message, backed by research, that is rarely endorsed on a stage with a global spotlight as influential as the Olympics. Prioritizing pleasure in sexual health refers to the approach of celebrating the physical and mental benefits of sexual experiences as well as minimizing the risks. It aims to rewrite fear and shame narratives that cast sex as taboo, with sexual health organizations promoting the sex-positive method as fundamental for unlocking greater agency over sexual rights and well-being. A systematic review by the World Health Organization and advocacy group The Pleasure Project found that pleasure-inclusive sex education is a more effective sexual health intervention strategy than abstinence programs and risk-focused messaging. The findings show that it increases condom usage and enhances knowledge and self-esteem, which are crucial to promoting safer choices in the bedroom. The decision to focus on pleasure-inclusive messaging at the Olympics is especially significant at a time when sex education is increasingly under attack in many countries. In the United States alone, 2024 has seen a surge in restrictive state-level sex education proposals that aim to limit what can be taught in the classroom, such as by removing guidance around contraception or advocating for abstinence. History of Sex Ed at the Olympics Paris\u2019s focus on pleasure and consent is part of the Olympics\u2019 long-running history of promoting safe sex, with organizers of the 1988 Seoul Games first making headline-grabbing hand-outs of condoms to competitors to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS. Since then, the International Olympic Committee has encouraged host cities to roll out condom initiatives at all summer and winter games, from a record-breaking 450,000 condoms at the 2016 Rio Olympics - equivalent to 42 per athlete - to keeping up the tradition at the 2022 Beijing Olympics despite COVID-19 social distancing rules. This year, organizers in charge of first aid announced that over 200,000 male condoms, 20,000 female condoms, and 10,000 dental dams would be made available at the Paris Olympic Village, which will host around 14,500 athletes. They will also have numerous sexual health testing centers on site for athletes, in addition to the sexual health awareness messaging. While one athlete - a gold medallist - once suggested sex was \u201c\u200b\u200bpart of the Olympic spirit \u2026 Why do you think they give away so many condoms?\u201d the massive number of condoms distributed is not just a reflection of the competitors\u2019 extra-athletic activities. Instead, the initiatives are intended to be used as a springboard for sex education. Anne Philpott is the founder of The Pleasure Project, an international organization that has spent the past two decades advocating for pleasure-inclusive sex education. She applauds Paris\u2019 decision to pair its condom initiative with pleasure and consent messaging. \u201cSo far the public health world has not done a good job of promoting safe sex,\u201d Philpott said, explaining that promoting condoms \u201cpurely for avoiding negative consequences,\u201d is not effective. Rather, she says the most productive way to encourage safe sex is to flip the script from the beginning by focusing on why people have sex. \u201cPeople think pleasure is a bit frivolous or the icing on the cake. But we now know that if we had integrated pleasure considerations into sexual health interventions from the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, we would have saved considerably more lives,\u201d Philpott explained. Philpott told CNN that the need to shift the narrative in safe sex conversations is as urgent as ever. She says if there is a failure to do so, people could instead shape their opinions from the misinformation and harmful explicit content running rampant online. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big rise in choking being seen as a normal part of sexual activity when it\u2019s actually very dangerous,\u201d Philpott gave as an example, as she urged sex education curriculums to catch up with what people are able to access online. Turning sport into a sex ed classroom The need to learn about one\u2019s sexual desires, needs, and boundaries is a constantly evolving process, with the Olympics\u2019 spotlight on safe sex also highlighting the opportunity for wider sporting communities to become trusted spaces for such conversations. In the coastal town of Kilifi in Kenya, Deogratia Okoko sees the value of expanding sex education beyond the classroom, using soccer to teach young boys about issues such as consent and contraception. The scheme to which he contributes, known as \u201cMoving The Goalposts,\u201d works directly with community leaders, fathers, and young boys to provide resources on sexual health, sexual rights, gender, and positive masculinity. \u201cWe found that one of the places that they spend a lot of their time is the football pitch,\u201d Okoko said. \u201cWe began to design our sessions based on soccer drills to explain certain issues,\u201d Okoko said, adding: \u201cYou\u2019ll find that sometimes they get so engrossed in the debrief discussions that they forget that they were supposed to actually train and play.\u201d Okoko explained that the initiative also provides a safe space for boys to access condoms and HIV testing kits, with societal shame often creating barriers for boys to buy these products directly from the shops. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just let\u2019s play football, let\u2019s practice and go away \u2026 these spaces are now a community used by them to talk about issues that they\u2019d not normally talk about,\u201d Okoko said. \u201cOne of the things that really came clearly to me was how using this strategy helped in mental health,\u201d Okoko told CNN. \u201cThey feel like they can talk about anything, if there\u2019s a challenge that they\u2019re going through, they come to the pitch.\u201d Reflecting on the Paris organizers\u2019 decision to include pleasure and consent in their sexual health messaging, Okoko says it is \u201cimperative\u201d to have high-profile platforms set the example. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental. It\u2019s important. It\u2019s good if we, to the best of our abilities, find great ways of passing that message across,\u201d Okoko said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/europe/paris-olympics-sex-education-pleasure-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_europe_ukraine-germany-aid-halved-intl", "text": "Germany plans to halve its military aid to Ukraine next year, despite concerns that US support for Kyiv could potentially diminish if Republican candidate Donald Trump returns to the White House. German aid to Ukraine will be cut to \u20ac4 billion ($4.35 billion) in 2025 from around \u20ac8 billion in 2024, according to a draft of the 2025 budget seen by Reuters. Germany hopes Ukraine will be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the Group of Seven, and that funds earmarked for armaments will not be fully used. \u201cUkraine\u2019s financing is secured for the foreseeable future thanks to European instruments and the G7 loans,\u201d German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Wednesday at a news conference. Washington pushed to \u201cfront load\u201d the loans to give Ukraine a big lump sum now. Officials say EU leaders agreed to the idea in part because it reduces the chance of Ukraine being short of funds if Trump returns to the White House. Alarm bells rang across Europe this week after Trump picked Senator JD Vance, who opposes military aid for Ukraine and warned Europe will have to rely less on the United States to defend the continent, as his candidate for vice president. Trump sparked fierce criticism from Western officials for suggesting he would not protect countries that failed to meet the transatlantic military alliance\u2019s defense spending targets and would even encourage Russia to attack them. Germany has faced criticism for repeatedly missing a NATO target of spending 2% of its economic output on defense. Depleted military stocks The stocks of Germany\u2019s armed forces, already run down by decades of underinvestment, have been further depleted by arms supplies to Kyiv. So far, Berlin has donated three Patriot air defense units to Kyiv, more than any other country, bringing down the number of Patriot systems in Germany to nine. Germany\u2019s fractious coalition of left-leaning Social Democrats, pro-business liberals and ecologist Greens has struggled to comply with NATO\u2019s spending target due to self-imposed rules that limit the amount of state borrowing they can take on. Although military aid to Ukraine will be cut, Germany will comply with the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense in 2025, with a total of \u20ac75.3 billion. Days after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a \u201cZeitenwende\u201d \u2013 German for historic turning point - with a \u20ac100 billion special fund to bring the military up to speed. From this special fund, there will be \u20ac22.0 billion more for defense, plus \u20ac53.3 billion in the regular budget, still less than that sought by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. The defense budget is set to receive a meagre \u20ac1.3 billion more than in 2024, far below the \u20ac6.7 billion requested by Pistorius. As ever-increasing annual operating costs outpace this rise, the defense ministry is being forced to cut ammunition orders for 2025 by more than half, reduce procurement by \u20ac260 million and research and development by over \u20ac200 million. The budget for 2025 comes with the mid-term financial planning until 2028, the year when the armed forces\u2019 special fund to meet NATO\u2019s minimum spending goals is due to run out and 80 billion will be needed for defense, as noted in the financial plan. In 2028, there is a gap of \u20ac39 billion in the regular budget, of which \u20ac28 billion are needed to comply with the NATO target without the special fund, sources from the finance ministry said. Decisions on how the hole will be plugged are not likely to be taken until after the 2025 election. \u201cThe 80 billion euros that have been put on display for 2028 simply do not exist,\u201d said Ingo Gaedechens, member of the parliament\u2019s budget committee from the conservative opposition party CDU. \u201cThe coalition is not even trying to cover this up but are openly admitting it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/ukraine-germany-aid-halved-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a 236-page report titled \u201c\u2018I Can\u2019t Erase All the Blood from My Mind\u2019: Palestinian Armed Groups\u2019 October 7 Assault on Israel,\u201d the rights watchdog said that the October 7 attack was \u201cdirected against a civilian population,\u201d and that \u201ckilling civilians and taking hostages were central aims of the planned attack, not an afterthought, a plan gone awry, or isolated acts.\u201d \u201cThe Hamas-led assault on October 7 was designed to kill civilians and take as many people as possible hostage,\u201d said Ida Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at HRW. The assault was led by Hamas\u2019 military wing \u2013 the Qassam Brigades \u2013 but included at least four other Palestinian armed groups, the report said. The report details several dozen cases of serious violations of international humanitarian law by Palestinian armed groups at most civilian attack sites on October 7, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The rights group said it interviewed 144 people, including 94 Israeli and other nationals, who witnessed the October 7 assault, which targeted at least 19 kibbutzim (agricultural communes) and five moshavim (cooperative communities). The cities of Sderot and Ofakim, two music festivals, and a beach party were also targeted, HRW added. \u201cThe armed groups committed numerous violations of the laws of war that amount to war crimes,\u201d the report said. These include \u201cattacks targeting civilians and civilian objects, willful killing of people in custody, cruel and other inhumane treatment.\u201d Palestinian fighters committed summary killings and hostage-taking along with murder and wrongful imprisonment, HRW added. Sexual and gender-based violence The report also highlighted \u201ccrimes involving sexual and gender-based violence, hostage-taking, mutilation and despoiling bodies, use of human shields, and pillage and looting.\u201d Israel and the United Nations have also accused Hamas-led militants of committing sexual violence on October 7. In March, the UN special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, said her team found \u201creasonable grounds to believe that conflict related sexual violence, including rape and gang rape occurred\u201d that day. It was the UN\u2019s most definitive finding on allegations of sexual assault in the aftermath of the attack. Several first responders who attended the scenes of the October 7 attack told CNN in December that the attacks were overwhelmingly gruesome and that some female victims were found undressed. HRW said that Hamas responded to its questions, stating that its forces were instructed not to target civilians and to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law. \u201cIn many cases, Human Rights Watch investigations found evidence to the contrary,\u201d the watchdog said. Hamas rejected the findings of the report and called for it to be retracted, according to a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe reject the lies and blatant bias towards the occupation and the lack of professionalism and credibility in the Human Rights Watch report. We demand its withdrawal and an apology,\u201d the Palestinian group said. \u2018Atrocities do not justify atrocities\u2019 In response to the October 7 attack, Israel launched an air and ground offensive on Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of Gaza\u2019s population of 2 million, turned swathes of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. Previous HRW reports have addressed several alleged serious violations by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 7. In its Wednesday report, HRW called on all parties involved in the conflict to abide by international humanitarian law. \u201cThe Palestinian armed groups in Gaza should immediately and unconditionally release civilians held hostage,\u201d the report said, adding that both parties \u201cshould surrender for prosecution anyone facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant.\u201d In May, the ICC said it was seeking arrest warrants for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, among other Israeli and Hamas officials, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza. \u00a0A case is also being heard by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over an accusation by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide in its war in Gaza. \u201cAtrocities do not justify atrocities,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cTo stop the endless cycle of abuses in Israel and Palestine, it\u2019s critical to address root causes and hold violators of grave crimes to account. That\u2019s in the interests of both Palestinians and Israelis.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/middleeast/hamas-israel-october-7-attack-human-rights-watch-report-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_india_india-godmen-crowd-crush-bhole-baba-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "The devotees rushed to collect soil from the ground the man had just walked on, thousands thronging to the front of a venue densely crammed with a quarter of a million people, under stifling heat. But one by one, many began falling onto the muddy field and into a sewer nearby, crushing each other as panicked screams pierced the air. They had arrived to receive spiritual enlightenment, but 121 people \u2013 mostly women \u2013 were killed by the crowd crush in northern India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state last week. Those who survived were left scarred and traumatized. The man they had come to see was known to his disciples as Bhole Baba, a self-styled Hindu spiritual leader worshipped by many as a living god. And he is among dozens of spiritual gurus in the country who inspire devotion in millions of followers, have the ear of the Indian elite, and rake in colossal sums of money. While the world\u2019s most populous nation has long produced self-styled \u201cgodmen\u201d, the tradition has, over the last few decades, evolved into a multimillion-dollar industry, whose biggest stars control vast philanthropic and business empires. A large chunk of their money comes from their followers\u2019 donations. They are widely revered in a country where religion and faith dictate much of society \u2013 with some even winning endorsement from the highest echelons of society. But that industry occasionally finds itself mired in controversy, with several holy men either convicted or accused of a range of crimes \u2013 from financial fraud to murder and rape \u2013 alarming those who cast doubt on their divine personas. \u201cIt\u2019s a question we\u2019ve long asked,\u201d said Meera Nanda, author of \u201cThe God Market: How Globalization is Making India More Hindu.\u201d \u201cWhat brings literally millions of poor, desperate people to these godmen?\u201d A sense of belonging Subhash Lal was working as a security guard nearly 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Mughal Garhi village, where Bhole Baba was delivering his sermon, when the news flashed across his TV screen. Lal\u2019s mother, a devout follower of the guru, was among the crowd, and he was desperate for answers. Lal and his family rushed to the hospital that was treating the survivors, when his son learned of the devastating news. \u201cHe told me, Dad, your mother is no more,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cMy mother believed in (Bhole Baba). I couldn\u2019t tell her anything. She would attend these functions\u2026 she believed in him. What could I do?\u201d People like Lal\u2019s mother \u2013 poor and on the lower rungs of India\u2019s hierarchical caste system \u2013 make up the bulk of Bhole Baba\u2019s following. They are predominantly Dalit women from India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, where religion holds particular sway. And for them, a sense of devotion to these godmen is a way to be seen and heard within the Hindu religion. Despite being outlawed in 1950, the caste system, which categorizes Hindus at birth and once forced the so-called \u201cuntouchables\u201d or Dalits to the margins of society, is still omnipresent in the daily lives of millions across the nation. Policeman turned preacher Reportedly born Narayan Sakar to a low-caste family, Bhole Baba used to be a constable with the Uttar Pradesh Police before becoming a preacher and establishing an ashram \u2013 or place of worship \u2013 in the state. Sitting on an ornately decorated chair, he often delivers impassioned sermons exhorting his followers to maintain their devotion. \u201cIf, through the medium of truth, you remove old trash from within you, and today if you let truth into your heart, devotion for the god into your heart, humanity into your heart\u2026 then know that even if the world abuses you, you will not get affected by it at all,\u201d he can be heard saying in one of his speeches. The \u201crigidity of caste structure\u201d is an important reason for the proliferation of godmen, said K. Kalyani, an assistant professor of Sociology at Azim Premji University, Bangalore. \u201cThe low-caste community are particularly debarred within Hindu religion to have respectable position within religious institutions,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir presence in the sanctum sanctorum as priest or their proximity to deity is seen as an act of defilement due to practices of \u2018untouchability\u2019.\u201d In the absence of religious and spiritual gratification for low-caste Hindus, Kalyani said, an \u201calternative form of religiosity becomes inevitable.\u201d Sheetal Jatav, a survivor of last week\u2019s Bhole Baba event, said her community \u2013 the lower-caste Jatavs \u2013 \u201cbelieve in him immensely,\u201d hanging his pictures on their walls or even placing it inside small temples at home. Jatav said she was previously unable to get pregnant but conceived within two months of visiting Bole Baba\u2019s ashram. \u201cThere are many similar stories like this here,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cHe speaks of good things and wants all of us to do good deeds. We go there and feel peace.\u201d Miracle workers The gurus India has produced range from men who claim they can perform miracles, like the revered Sathya Sai Baba, to the yoga guru and founder of the widely popular Art of Living foundation, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Claiming to possess mystical knowledge and the ability to cure illness and solve problems, godmen inspire remarkable fervor in their millions of followers. But with their rise has come a slew of criticism over the true intentions behind this perceived divinity, fueled in recent decades by their grandiose lifestyles and immense wealth. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of the spiritual organization Dera Sacha Sauda, is another self-styled spiritual guru revered by millions. His group has ashrams across 10 states and union territories in India and claims to have 60 million followers worldwide. He is also a convicted killer and rapist. In 2017 he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for raping two of his followers. Two years later, he received a life term for the murder of a journalist who exposed the sexual abuse of women within his group. Despite the severity of his crimes, Singh maintains a cult-like following. The rape conviction even sparked riots by his supporters that left 36 people dead and hundreds injured across northern India. Since then, Singh has been granted parole multiple times, once even walking out of prison to attend his own birthday party, raising allegations of impunity for these holy men. \u201cThey have deep connections with the political machine\u2026 and it\u2019s deeply problematic,\u201d Nanda, the author, said. The furor over Singh\u2019s case was reminiscent of violent skirmishes that broke out in 2013 after the arrest of guru Asaram Bapu for raping a 16-year-old girl. He was convicted five years later and given a life sentence for the crime. Famous followers Many godmen are also known for their philanthropy, praised for building schools for the impoverished and developing infrastructure in small villages \u2013 and they also attract millions of people to small towns across the country. Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s followers, for example, included the US actor Goldie Hawn and Hard Rock Cafe founder Isaac Tigrett. When the guru died in 2011, Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar openly wept at his funeral, which was also attended by India\u2019s prime minister at the time, Manmohan Singh. More often than not, the most devout of their followers come from the lower middle classes, but millions in donations also stream in from foreigners, Indians living abroad, and the richest of society. While Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s appeal was \u2013 in large part \u2013 due to a certain level of mystique, other godmen, including Singh, are more outspoken, carefully using the media to fuel their rise. \u201cThere is an entire media structure that supports and promotes them,\u201d said Kalyani, the sociologist. \u201cThere are dedicated channels like Astha or Sanskar TV which have dedicated time to show their preachings.\u201d As authorities investigate the organizers of last week\u2019s event for alleged negligence, Bhole Baba, who left the event in an armored vehicle, is not being pursued by authorities. Many of those affected by the tragedy are angry. \u201cThis is not a real (godman),\u201d said Surendra Singh, whose wife was a devout follower of the guru, and died in the tragic crowd crush. Speaking to India\u2019s largest news agency, ANI, Bhole Baba, appearing forlorn, said: \u201cThis incident has left me distraught.\u201d \u201cMischief makers and anti-social elements responsible for the stampede will not be spared.\u201d Referring to himself by his birth name, he added: \u201cMay the praise of Narayan Sakar Hari resound forever throughout the universe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/india/india-godmen-crowd-crush-bhole-baba-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Authorities said Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, \u201clured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies,\u201d of which only nine have been recovered. He was arrested in Soweto, east of the capital Nairobi, at 3 a.m. local time on Monday, outside a club where he had gone to watch the Euro 2024 soccer final, Kenya\u2019s director of criminal investigations,\u00a0Mohamed Amin,\u00a0told journalists on Monday. \u201cOn interrogation, the suspect confessed to having lured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies at the dumping site, all murdered between 2022 and Thursday, 11 July, 2024,\u201d Amin said. Acting police inspector general, Douglas Kanja, added in a statement that the \u201cpost-mortem examination is happening today\u201d on the nine bodies recovered so far. In a news conference on Sunday before the suspect\u2019s arrest, Kanja said the bodies \u201cwere severely dismembered, in different states of decomposition, and left in sacks.\u201d \u201cWe are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for life,\u201d Amin said Monday. Khalusha \u201cled officers to his single room rented house,\u201d which is located about 100 meters (328 feet) from the crime scene, Amin said. A machete, 12 nylon sacks, a pair of industrial rubber gloves, a hard drive, and eight smart phones were among \u201ccrucial\u201d items police said they discovered in the rented house. Amin said that, according to the suspect\u2019s confession, his first victim was his wife, whom he \u201cstrangled to death before dismembering her body and disposing it at the site.\u201d \u201cFrom his interrogation, all his victims have been murdered in like manner,\u201d he said. Khalusha\u2019s arrest followed \u201cforensic analysis of a mobile phone belonging to one of the victims, Josphine Mulongo Owino, where mobile money transactions conducted on the day she went missing pointed to the suspect,\u201d according to Amin. The first six bodies were discovered on Friday by residents\u00a0of Kware, in Nairobi\u2019s Mukuru kwa Njenga neighborhood.\u00a0Kenyan Police\u00a0said the bodies were found in an \u201cabandoned quarry,\u201d currently \u201cfilled with water and used as a dumpsite.\u201d On Monday, police said the suspect lived a short walk from the dumpsite, raising questions about how he evaded detection for two years. The site is also close to a police station. A group of female leaders called for enhanced protections for\u00a0Kenyan women on Monday after increasing cases of femicide. \u201cThose women might have been killed today, but which woman is next in line?\u201d asked Kajiado lawmaker Leah Sankaire Sopiato at a press briefing. \u201cIt is so sad that someone who killed 42 people was still roaming out there.

The ethnically split island is a persistent source of tension between Greece and Turkey, which are both partners in NATO but are at odds over numerous issues. Their differences were laid bare on Saturday, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attending a celebratory military parade in north Nicosia to mark the day in 1974 when Turkish forces launched an offensive that they call a \u201cpeace operation.\u201d Later in the day, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was due to attend an event in the south of the city to commemorate what Greeks commonly refer to as the \u201cbarbaric Turkish invasion.\u201d Mitsotakis posted an image of a blood-stained map of Cyprus on his LinkedIn page with the words \u201cHalf a century since the national tragedy of Cyprus.\u201d There was jubilation in the north. \u201cThe Cyprus Peace Operation saved Turkish Cypriots from cruelty and brought them to freedom,\u201d Erdogan said, criticizing the south for having a \u201cspoiled mentality\u201d and seeing itself as the sole ruler of Cyprus. But Erdogan left open a window to dialogue in deadlocked negotiations. \u201cWe are ready for negotiations, to meet, and to establish long-term peace and resolution in Cyprus,\u201d he said. Peace talks are now stalled at two seemingly irreconcilable concepts - Greek Cypriots want reunification as a federation. Turkish Cypriots want a two-state settlement. Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart in violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and led to the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping force. The crisis left Greek Cypriots running the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus, a member of the European Union since 2004 with the potential to derail Turkey\u2019s own decades-long aspirations of joining the bloc. Remembering the dead Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides, whose office represents the Greek Cypriot community in the reunification dialogue, said the anniversary was a somber occasion for reflection and for remembering the dead. \u201cOur mission is liberation, reunification and solving the Cyprus problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we really want to send a message on this tragic anniversary \u2026 it is to do anything possible to reunite Cyprus.\u201d Turkey, he said, continued to be responsible for violating human rights and international law over Cyprus. Across the south, church services were held to remember the more than 3,000 people who died in the Turkish invasion. \u201cIt was a betrayal of Cyprus and so many kids were lost. It wasn\u2019t just my son, it was many,\u201d said Loukas Alexandrou, 90, as he tended the grave of his son at a military cemetery. In Turkey, state television focused on violence against Turkish Cypriots prior to the invasion, particularly on bloodshed in 1963-64 and in 1967. Turkey\u2019s invasion took more than a third of the island and expelled more than 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. Reunification talks collapsed in 2017 and have been at a stalemate since.

The journalist, Giulia Cortese, was also given a suspended fine of \u20ac1,200 ($1,300) for a jibe on Twitter, now named X, in October 2021 about Meloni\u2019s height, which was defined as \u201cbody shaming\u201d. In a response to a Reuters story on the verdict, Cortese wrote on X on Thursday: \u201cItaly\u2019s government has a serious problem with freedom of expression and journalistic dissent.\u201d Meloni had launched legal action against the journalist after the two women clashed on social media three years ago. Meloni, whose far-right Brothers of Italy party was in opposition at the time, took exception when Cortese published a mocked-up photo of her with a picture of the late fascist leader Benito Mussolini in the background. Cortese responded with further tweets including one that translates as \u201cyou don\u2019t scare me, Giorgia Meloni. After all, you\u2019re only 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall. I can\u2019t even see you.\u201d Meloni\u2019s height is given as between 1.58 meters (5 feet 2 inches) and 1.63 meters (5 feet 4 inches) on various media websites.

The vessel left Haiti on Wednesday carrying over 80 migrants, and was headed to Turks and Caicos, the IOM said. Forty-one survivors were rescued by Haiti\u2019s Coast Guard, it also said. In a statement, Gr\u00e9goire Goodstein, IOM\u2019s chief of mission in the country, blamed the tragedy on Haiti\u2019s spiraling security crisis and the lack of \u201csafe and legal pathways for migration.\u201d \u201cHaiti\u2019s socio-economic situation is in agony. The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_18_asia_japan-south-korea-military-ties-china-north-korea-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "America\u2019s two most powerful allies in the Pacific are taking their defense ties to new heights amid increasing concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the region and North Korean threats, Japan\u2019s top general said Thursday. Before a trilateral meeting with US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. CQ Brown and South Korean Adm. Kim Myung-soo, Japanese Gen. Yoshihide Yoshida said China was trying to \u201cchange the status quo by force\u201d in the East China and South China seas, while North Korea was carrying out \u201crepeated ballistic missile launches and continuous arms transfers\u201d to Russia. Yoshida called on Japan, South Korea and the United States to \u201cdemonstrate our strong unity domestically and globally to ensure regional peace and stability.\u201d But bilateral cooperation between Japan and South Korea is the most noteworthy result of this week\u2019s meeting in Tokyo. On Wednesday, Yoshida met South Korea\u2019s Kim for the first such meeting between the East Asian defense chiefs in six years - a moment a US defense official stressed was significant. Kim said he and Yoshida \u201cshare a lot of the same thoughts,\u201d an acknowledgment of the mutual perspective on the regional threat posed by China and North Korea. \u201cWe developed strong trust between us,\u201d said Yoshida, adding the meeting sets the stage for the Japan-South Korea bilateral \u201cdefense cooperation to achieve a new height.\u201d Regional analyst James Brown said the Japan-South Korea meeting showed just how far the bilateral relationship has come under South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who succeeded Moon Jae-in in 2022. \u201cThe political mood has improved significantly, and now we\u2019re having the defense side of things aligning with that,\u201d said Brown, a professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo. \u201cThe Japanese government\u2019s feeling about this is that this is the relationship they\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d Japan felt the previous administration in Seoul was \u201cfixated on historical issues\u201d as it \u201cdemonized Japan\u201d and tried to improve relations with North Korea, Brown said. Last month, Japan and South Korea joined the US in the inaugural Freedom Edge in the Pacific, a military exercise that focused on ballistic missile and air defense, anti-submarine warfare and more. The goal of the exercise, which is set to expand in future years, was to allow the militaries to better work together against a common adversary. For years, historical acrimony between the two East Asian countries prevented high-level meetings and cooperation, with decades of deep mistrust dating back to Japan\u2019s colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula a century ago. But as the countries faced an increasingly assertive China and threats from North Korea, efforts to cooperate quickly supplanted past animosity, driven in large part by the efforts of US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. In March 2023, the two countries promised to resume ties at a fence-mending summit in Tokyo. Four months later, Biden hosted the leaders of Japan and South Korea at Camp David, where they pledged to \u201cinaugurate a new era of trilateral partnership.\u201d Then last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met his Japanese and South Korean counterparts on the sidelines of a security conference in Singapore, where they announced joint military exercises - nearly unthinkable just a few years ago. The trilateral meeting of the chiefs of defense at the Japanese Defense Ministry on Thursday, held for the first time in Tokyo, underscored the rapidly developing cooperation. \u201cI expect that the three of us sitting here in Tokyo today will send a message to the regional threats but also more globally on the strength of our relationship, our alliances, and the work that we need to continue to do,\u201d said Gen. Brown, sitting alongside his counterparts at the beginning of the meeting. The meeting comes on the heels of the NATO summit held last week in Washington, on the 75th anniversary of the alliance. The NATO communique specifically mentioned the importance of the Indo-Pacific, \u201cgiven that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security.\u201d In their opening remarks Thursday, the Japanese and South Korean defense chiefs both mentioned their concern over Russia\u2019s expanding relations with North Korea. Earlier this week, Brown told CNN: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is NATO nations increasing interest in what happens in the Indo-Pacific, and Indo-Pacific nations having an interest in what goes on in Europe as well.\u201d Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said there was some sense of urgency behind the rapidly developing cooperation. The East Asian nations, he said, want to triangulate a coordinated response to common adversaries before potential changes in Seoul or Washington could put the relationship in jeopardy. \u201cDomestic politics remain complicated in Seoul and Tokyo, but policymakers and military professionals want to lock in coordinated responses to North Korea, Russia, and China before any major political changes occur in Washington,\u201d Easley said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/asia/japan-south-korea-military-ties-china-north-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Swiss sportswear brand On is the latest company to embrace advanced \u201cspray-on\u201d materials with a \u201crevolutionary\u201d robot-made sneaker it believes can improve performance at this month\u2019s Olympics. The Cloudboom Strike LS is lace-free and weighs less than the latest iPhone. Designed to be more adaptable, dynamic and supportive than your average running sneakers, the $330 shoes already have a convincing track record: Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri, an Olympic silver medalist and the only woman to have won indoor, outdoor and cross-country world titles, triumphed at this year\u2019s Boston Marathon wearing a pair. She will don them again to compete in the Paris 2024 Games this summer. Zurich-based On credits its shoes\u2019 success to a combination of biomechanics, physiology and extreme lightness. (A men\u2019s US size 8.5 weighs just 170g per shoe, over 100g lighter than several popular running shoes of the same size.) \u201cMore than anything, we want (the athletes) to win,\u201d said senior director of innovation, Ilmarin Heitz, in a promotional video published Monday. \u201cThat is our gauge of success.\u201d With no heel-cap, laces or tongue, the translucent, sock-like sneaker looks like a running shoe that has shed its skin. Its inventor, Johannes Voelchert, came up with the idea as a student after seeing a Halloween-themed hot glue gun that shot decorative spider webs. \u201cI saw that there was a quick way of creating a textile onto a complex shape,\u201d Voelchert, now On\u2019s senior lead of innovation concept design, said in the brand\u2019s video. \u201cA shoe seemed to be the right object.\u201d Voelchert brought his idea to the Milan Design Fair, where he caught the Swiss sportswear brand\u2019s attention. According to On, the shoe\u2019s uppers (the material above the sole) are made from a type of thermoplastic and colored and branded in three minutes using just a robotic arm. The upper is sprayed in one go and can be attached to the carbon-fiber and foam rubber sole using heat, not glue.

{"id": "2024_07_20_middleeast_yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl", "text": "Israeli airstrikes targeted Houthi rebels in Yemen a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck \u201cmilitary targets of the Houthi terrorist regime\u201d in the area of Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah Port on Saturday in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv Friday. This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the Israeli strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen\u2019s west coast, killing at least three people and injuring 87, most of them with \u201csevere burns.\u201d Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was \u201cbrutal Israeli aggression\u201d aimed at increasing the \u201csuffering of the people of Yemen\u201d and pressuring it to stop its support of Gaza. Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel\u2019s \u201cvital targets\u201d and warning that Tel Aviv was still not safe. \u201cWe have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,\u201d Saree said. \u2018Not an innocent port\u2019 Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was \u201cnot an innocent port.\u201d \u201cIt was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea. Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel\u2019s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats. \u201cIt makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,\u201d Netanyahu said. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 projectiles the rebel group has fired towards Israel since October, when Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza began. Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel\u2019s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday \u2013 which also injured 10 people \u2013 was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses. An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv. According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out. The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months. A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on \u201cdevelopments\u201d in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to self-defense.\u201d Who are the Houthis? The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah \u2013 Arabic for \u2018Supporters of God\u2019 \u2013\u00a0is a Shi\u2019ite Islamist political and military organization backed by Iran, that emerged in the 1990s. Similar to chants used by Lebanon-based Iranian proxy Hezbollah, the Houthis\u2019 official slogan reads, \u201cGod is the Greatest. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory to Islam.\u201d In 2014, Houthi forces allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, from the UN-recognized Yemeni government, sparking a civil war that has afflicted the country ever since. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have led a coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces. More recently, the group has come to be seen in parts of the largely-Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel. Since October 7, Houthi rebels have carried out numerous missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, asserting that these vessels are linked to Israel and its allies, which has escalated tensions throughout the Middle East. Regional tensions rise The strike on Hodeidah comes amid rising tensions in the region. In recent weeks the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel\u2019s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should \u201cadopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.\u201d Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant echoed Gvir\u2019s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack \u201cwith all its might even in distant places,\u201d while Gallant said \u201cthe blood of Israeli citizens has a price,\u201d and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the \u201cresult will be identical.\u201d \u201cThe fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,\u201d Gallant said. Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said \u201cwe stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.\u201d Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it a \u201cdangerous escalation.\u201d Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to \u201cmaximize sanctions on Iran.\u201d \u201cIran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIran is the head of the snake \u2013 it must be stopped now,\u201d Katz added. Iran condemned the Israeli strike on Hodeidah. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani warned of the risk of war in the region, saying Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were the \u201croot\u201d of the escalating tensions. \u201cThe oppressed but powerful people of Yemen are paying the price for their honorable support of the innocent citizens, women and children of Gaza,\u201d Kanaani said.

{"id": "2024_07_19_middleeast_gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd", "text": "The Aljamal family was widely respected in Gaza\u2019s Nuseirat camp. They were known as pious and prominent members of the community. While people knew they had connections to Hamas, neighbors say no one could have guessed how deep those links truly went. When Israeli forces stormed the Aljamals\u2019 building on June 8 they found Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv, hostages who had been captured from the Nova music festival on October 7, cowering in a darkened room. The experience of the three men \u2013 alongside that of Noa Argamani who was held in another house nearby, belonging to the Abu Nar family \u2013 echoes testimony from previously released hostages. They describe being confined among the civilian population, rather than in Hamas\u2019 vast tunnel network under Gaza. In the aftermath of last month\u2019s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst. \u201cHad we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,\u201d one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said. Dr. Aljamal, 74, was a general practitioner and also led the call to prayer at the local mosque, waking early every day to get there before dawn. \u201cHe was a pious man,\u201d neighbor Abdelrahman El Tahrawi said. \u201cHe leads the prayer, then he goes back to his home. He didn\u2019t mix with people, didn\u2019t complain about other people, and no one complained about him. He was a man who minded his own business.\u201d Dr. Aljamal\u2019s son Abdallah, 36, was a freelance journalist who most recently wrote for the US-based Palestine Chronicle, for which he filed regular dispatches on the war in Gaza. Neighbors told CNN it was no secret that the family had links to Hamas. \u201cWe were worried about the Aljamal house. They are with Hamas,\u201d said a neighbor and family acquaintance. Abdallah had served as a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Labor as recently as 2022, a position entrusted only to Hamas members, according to political analysts. He also showed his support for the group on social media. On Facebook, he posted pictures of his young son dressed in the fatigues of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, and on October 7 openly praised the group\u2019s attack on Israel. In a 2022 video post, Abdallah commended the Hamas operation to kidnap Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was held in Gaza between 2006 and 2011, and proclaimed: \u201cBrothers, all of us are prepared to die for the resistance.\u201d Public support for Hamas as a political movement in Gaza has ranged from 34 to 42% over the past seven months, according to polls by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.\u00a0Polling in Gaza faces multiple challenges, including population displacement, people\u2019s reluctance to criticize Hamas publicly and the risks to personal safety in war time. The true level of support for Hamas may be lower, according to Dr. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip. Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters \u2013 some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. At least 1,200 people were killed and\u00a0some 250 people in total were taken from Israel into the strip, according to Israeli authorities. A senior Hamas official last month told CNN the group does not know how many hostages are still alive, suggesting it may not have full oversight of their whereabouts. Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz told an Israeli TV channel that Israel knows to a \u201cvery close number\u201d how many hostages remain alive. Despite the level of support in Gaza for Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007, far fewer people would be accepted into the trusted inner circles of the Islamist movement. Hostages being held by civilians under the direction of Hamas is unlikely unless they have very strong ties to and are well trusted by the group, according to Abusada. \u201cHamas only trusts Hamas when it comes to those very sensitive issues such as Israeli hostages,\u201d he said. There may be other reasons why Hamas chose to house hostages in civilian homes, however. Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said that approach fits Hamas\u2019 strategy to get Israel \u201cbogged down in the urban centers of Gaza and push them into a counterinsurgency that cannot end, which is the perpetual war Hamas says it wants.\u201d \u2018Creative punishment\u2019 The three hostages who were held in the Aljamal family building were kept there for around six months, according to Andrey Kozlov, who spoke last week to CNN. Kozlov described physical and psychological abuse he received at the hands of his guards. One in particular, he said, \u201cwas a big fan of creative punishment\u201d who on one occasion forced him to spend two days on a mattress without moving or talking as a penalty for standing near an open window, and on another occasion covered him with blankets in the summer heat for washing his hands with drinking water. \u201cI was trying to breathe through the space between the mattress and blankets,\u201d he said. During that time the hostages could hear the family, including children, going about their daily lives on the floor below, according to Aviram Meir, the uncle of Almog Meir Jan. In the weeks before Israel\u2019s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah\u2019s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before. Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat. Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah\u2019s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. The Israeli soldiers entered and shot Abdallah\u2019s wife Fatima first, before killing Ahmed and Abdallah, she wrote. Zainab hid with Abdallah\u2019s children under a bed, according to the now-deleted Facebook post which was shared with CNN by independent open-source researcher Thomas Bordeaux. \ufeffZainab said in the post that the family had been waiting for the moment they would be killed by Israeli forces. \u201cSince the start of the war, we have been waiting for this moment. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.\u201d As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block \u2013 which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials \u2013 to retrieve Argamani. Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back. Less is known about Argamani\u2019s captors. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse. In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani\u2019s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen. The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details. According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel\u2019s\u00a0 Nuseirat operation last month. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day. CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment. \u2018A normal man\u2019 Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight. Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out. \u201cThey pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,\u201d Mazhar said. Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst. \u201cHe had young children at home,\u201d said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. \u201cNo one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.\u201d Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he\u2019d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201ca normal man,\u201d adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas. \u201cThey are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,\u201d said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. \u201cIf we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.\u201d After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site. More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured. Israel puts the number of deaths at under 100. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Many locals questioned why so many Palestinians had to die for the Israeli forces to rescue just four hostages. Al-Kahlot said: \u201cPeople died because they were freeing her, and no one was looking at us.\u201d CNN is not identifying some interviewees for their own security.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_middleeast_un-gaza-evacuation-displacement-intl-latam", "text": "United Nations agencies say that a new round of evacuation orders by the Israeli military in Gaza has prompted the largest displacements since October \u2013 making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult than previously. The World Food Programme said in a post on X Thursday: \u201cMany distribution points have had to shut down. Only a few bakeries remain operational. We urgently need increased deliveries of food and greater capacity to deliver hot meals.\u201d A spate of evacuation orders issued\u00a0 by the Israel Defense Forces in late June and earlier this month increased the number of people displaced in Gaza from 1.7 million to 1.9 million, according to a UN assessment. The WFP says it has\u00a0provided more than 600,000 people in Gaza with food assistance this month, and more than 500,000 people with food parcels and wheat flour. But the agency also reported having to further cut rations in central and southern Gaza to ensure broader coverage for people who have been newly displaced. \u201cWFP still needs to deliver more fuel to the bakeries and other services, so they can provide emergency support to displaced families,\u201d it said. \u201cBasic commodities are available in markets in southern and central Gaza \u2013 but are unaffordable for many people \u2013 the shortage of commercial goods means food is sold at astronomical prices.\u201d On Wednesday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the Israeli military had stopped all aid missions from going north of Wadi Gaza into central Gaza. \u201cThis means humanitarian workers were unable to reach any of the hundreds of thousands of people in need. It also made it impossible for them to collect supplies from the northern entry point of Erez West,\u201d it said. The Israeli agency in charge of coordinating the movement of aid convoys in Gaza, COGAT, told CNN it was unaware of any halt to the movement of convoys from the south of Gaza into northern areas through Wadi Gaza. Gaza\u2019s health sector remains under great stress. According to the World Health Organization, 15 of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals are partially functional, and 1,500 of the usual 3,500 hospital beds in Gaza are available \u2013 600 of them in field hospitals. Both the International Red Cross and the Gaza Health Ministry underlined the challenges to providing health care on Thursday. \u201cThe ambulance and emergency system is no longer able to respond to all calls and missions to transport the wounded and injured,\u201d the Health Ministry said because of a lack of ambulances, the arrest of paramedics by the IDF and a lack of gasoline. The Health Ministry said that primary health care was affected by shortages of about 60% of basic medications, as well as damage to many health centers, especially in Khan Younis in the south. It said infectious diseases continued to spread and had affected some 1.7 million people, and there was a shortage of blood units. One of the field hospitals under pressure is run by the International Committee for the Red Cross in Rafah, which is at capacity after \u201crepeated large-scale casualties,\u201d the ICRC Said Thursday, noting that a Saturday attack in Al-Mawasi resulted in children requiring treatment for shrapnel wounds. \u201cThe number of patients who had to be resuscitated after the large influx of injured on Saturday is inconceivable,\u201d said the ICRC\u2019s Dr. Pankaj Jhaldiyal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/middleeast/un-gaza-evacuation-displacement-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_mediterranean-beach-vacation-microplastics-pollution", "text": "The Mediterranean Sea may evoke images of luxurious beach holidays, scrumptious seafood meals and endless sandy beaches, but this body of water is increasingly toxic. More than 87% of the Mediterranean Sea, which extends from the Atlantic Ocean to Africa, Europe and Asia, is polluted with microplastics and other pollutants including toxic metals and industrial chemicals, according to a July 2024 report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Globally, water pollution is tied to 1.4 million premature deaths, which spells trouble for the 150 million people who live along the Mediterranean coastline, and the 270 million tourists who are drawn to these waters every single year. The Mediterranean Sea laps up against 46,000 kilometers (nearly 29,000 miles) of coastline in 22 countries, many with different environmental standards and practices. Egypt, which contributes 0.25 million tons of plastic that ends up in the Mediterranean, is the worst offender, the group says, followed by Turkey, which contributes 0.11 million tons and Italy, which contributes 0.04 million tons of plastic to the polluted sea \u2013 all part of the 1.9 million plastic fragments per square meter. Medical experts consulted for the WWF report say that humans can ingest microplastics from aquatic environments through the consumption of marine organisms and through water (both drinking and bottled). \u201cOver 840 microplastics can be ingested per year from the consumption of three main commercial fish species (sea bass and two types of mackerel), [and] up to 11 thousand from the high consumption of bivalves (e.g. mussels, clams etc.),\u201d the report states, noting that less contamination comes from eating shrimp. \u201cIf we also count the exposure from air and food not coming from aquatic environments we can ingest over 100 thousand microplastics every day.\u201d Turning the tide At the seaside town of Ostia near Rome, Pierluigi Capozzi scans the sea from his restaurant, Mediterraneo. \u201cMaybe 50 years ago, people didn\u2019t know what we know now about pollution and plastic,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cBut I see young people without any problems throw plastic bottles into the sea, throw rubbish on the ground, cigarettes, garbage.\u201d But he does see a bright spot. A decade ago, every morning the sand outside his beachfront restaurant was covered with chemicals from the cargo ships that traverse the shipping lanes visible from the coastline. \u201cThanks to better regulation, that chemical pollution is gone now,\u201d he says. The Mediterranean is one of the world\u2019s major reservoirs of marine and coastal diversity, according to the Med Sea Alliance, which works to advocate for the fishing industry through better practices. They say that the heavy pollution is negatively impacting the sea\u2019s rich flora and fauna. Despite only covering 0.7 percent of the world\u2019s ocean area, the sea has 7.5 percent of the world\u2019s marine fauna, and 18 percent of the world\u2019s marine flora. Fishing is a \u20ac4.6 billion industry in the Mediterranean, and water pollution has greatly impacted the livelihood of the 180,000 people who rely on fishing for their livelihoods, says the WWF. The UN\u2019s Environmental Program says sea catches in the Mediterranean have fallen by 34% in the last 50 years, due to both over-fishing and plastics in the water. \u201cAround 730 tonnes of plastic waste end up daily in the Mediterranean Sea,\u201d the group says. \u201cPlastic waste represents 95 to 100% of marine floating waste and 50% of litter on sea beds. In tonnage, plastic could outweigh fish stocks.\u201d Impact on marine life A 2023 study by the Archipelago Institute of Marine Conservation in Greece examined 25 marine animals including eight dolphins, two monk seals and 15 sea turtles and found microplastic pollutants in all of them. \u201cIn particular, among other types of plastic, a total of 10,639 microplastic fibers were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of the dead marine mammals and turtles.\u201d Raffaele Marfella, a professor of advanced science at the Vanvitelli University in Naples, says plastic pollution is an urgent global problem that goes beyond harm to the environment. Citing a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, he highlights the link between microplastics\u00a0and nanoplastics known as MNPs and certain cardiovascular diseases. \u201cCurrent knowledge suggests that MNPs can enter the bloodstream through ingestion or inhalation, triggering inflammation and oxidative stress. Over time, chronic exposure to MNPs can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis and increase the likelihood of cardiovascular events.\u201d Plastic pollution is considered a \u201cforever\u201d pollutant, meaning once it becomes invasive, it is there to stay. Beach-goer Francesco Pacelli told CNN that it breaks his heart when he sees people leaving their garbage and bottles on the water\u2019s edge. \u201cIt is so important to keep a beach clean, the water it is more beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my opinion it is very important, especially for fish, animals with all the plastic that floats around.\u201d If humans don\u2019t do their part to stop the scourge of water pollution, the dream Mediterranean vacation could soon turn into a nightmare.

The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said the families of the observers \u2013 Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev \u2013 have decided to allow the publication of photos taken during their first days being held by the militant group. \u201cThe images reveal them bruised and wounded from the horrific abduction that the entire world witnessed,\u201d the forum said. In the pictures, Levy appears to have a badly bruised right eye. Another image shows four of the women sitting on bedding in a bare room; two of them, Gilboa and Ariev, have bandaged heads. \u201cThe courageous decision by the parents to reveal these photos aims to bring them closer to embracing their daughters,\u201d they said. Graphic video showing the capture of the group was previously released in May by their families. Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave. Following the attack,\u00a0Israel\u00a0launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. \u201cThis reunion is just a deal away, a deal that would bring all 120 hostages home \u2013 the living for rehabilitation and the murdered and fallen for proper burial,\u201d the forum said in its Tuesday statement. \u201cWe demand that the Israeli government, and particularly its leader, look these girls in the eyes, try to imagine what they and all the hostages have endured for 284 days, and do everything possible to bring them home.\u201d Albert Ariev, the father of Karina Ariev, told a news conference that accompanied the release: \u201cMy little Karina, only 19 years old, is in Gaza. Today, you see footage of Karina and her friends in their first days of captivity. It\u2019s so vivid \u2013 Karina sitting on a mattress on the floor, with an exhausted and desperate look.\u201d \u201cSwelling in her hands indicates that Karina was bound for a long time. You see one frame, but in the video, you can see facial wounds likely caused by shrapnel when the terrorists invaded the shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we are asking for is to have Karina back. There are also dead people there that need to be buried. The people demand that they all come back.\u201d Ariev urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \u201cPlease don\u2019t go abroad before this deal goes ahead.\u201d Netanyahu is under intense pressure to secure the release of more than 100 hostages still believed to be held by Hamas. Earlier Tuesday, he met with the families of other observers who were killed at the base, close to the northern Gaza Strip, which was overrun in Hamas\u2019 attack last October, with 16 soldiers killed. The prime minister\u2019s office said the meeting lasted three hours. It said he had \u201clistened attentively to the stories about the lives and heroism of each of the young women, felt the families\u2019 pain, and heard their requests and demands for an investigation into the events and for the commemoration of their daughters.\u201d \u201cThe prime minister answered their questions and said that matters would be thoroughly checked and that the lessons would be learned at all levels, including in the intelligence, operations, military and diplomatic spheres.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-idf-images-released-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_tech_apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets", "text": "Apple has yielded to pressure by European regulators to give rivals access to the contactless payments technology on iPhones, meaning that their users will no longer be limited to the Apple Pay mobile wallet. The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_tech_google-wiz-acquisition", "text": "Google owner Alphabet is in advanced discussions to buy fast-growing cybersecurity startup Wiz for roughly $23 billion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. A takeover of Wiz, which makes cybersecurity software for cloud computing, would represent a major bet by Google on cybersecurity, marking the tech giant\u2019s biggest-ever acquisition. Discussions between Google and Wiz began after the startup raised $1 billion from venture capital investors earlier this year, the source said. Terms of a potential deal have not been finalized and talks could still collapse, according to the source. News of the Google-Wiz talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Neither Google nor Wiz returned CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The deal would easily surpass Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion about a decade ago, the biggest takeover in company history. Google offloaded Motorola just two years later for a massive loss. A $23 billion price tag on Wiz is nearly double the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. In March 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion as part of its efforts to help companies better address cyber threats and bolster its cloud computing business. Google Cloud is central to the company\u2019s efforts to diversity revenue beyond its core search advertising business. Although its cloud sales have grown, it has struggled to compete with similar services from Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon. Buying Wiz would be a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d at Microsoft and Amazon, showing that Google is making a \u201cmajor bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship offering in the cloud,\u201d Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at\u00a0Wedbush, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Cloud security has become especially important in recent years as companies have spent heavily to move data to cloud platforms. Just last week, AT&T revealed that nearly all of its wireless customers\u2019 call and text records were exposed in a massive breach caused by an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform. The Google-Wiz deal talks come despite intense antitrust scrutiny under the Biden administration of tech giants. However, that antitrust scrutiny could be dialed back somewhat if Trump once again takes hold of the White House, Ives said, making the Federal Trade Commission \u201cmuch weaker\u201d and sparking an \u201caccelerated merger and acquisition environment to take place for Big Tech.\u201d If the acquisition gets finalized and closes, it would mark a massive exit for Wiz and its founders \u2014 Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik. The four executives met years ago when they were drafted into Unit 8200, the cyber intelligence division of the Israel Defense Forces. Since starting up in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York City-based Wiz has enjoyed explosive growth. Today, the company says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its clients. Notable customers include BMW, Slack and Salesforce, and it works with major cloud companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/tech/google-wiz-acquisition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2021_12_27_travel_what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed", "text": "Computer glitches. Bad weather. Air traffic controller shortages. Holiday crunches. Accidents and investigations. Unruly passengers. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled. It\u2019s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time \u2013 or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not). In the midst of a global IT fiasco on July 19 and a record-setting summer for air travel, here\u2019s some general advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled. Avoid getting trapped at the airport As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it\u2019s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room. \u201cCheck your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,\u201d said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. \u201cSave yourself the drive to the airport.\u201d  Keyes told CNN Travel that you should sign up for airlines\u2019 free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. You should also download your carrier\u2019s app. You can also put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the status that way. That\u2019s also handy for friends or family who are on standby to pick you up. Keyes also suggested checking the website FlightAware to track larger flight trends across the country. Days ahead of the now-infamous December 2022 bomb cyclone, many US airlines offered their passengers a chance to change their flights for no fee. When you know a major weather event is forecast, hop on those waiver offers quickly, said Keyes, The early birds have the best choices of the remaining worms (that is seats and flights). If you\u2019re at the airport already  Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you\u2019ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do? Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents\u2019 desk \u2013 and get ready to multitask while you\u2019re in line. Fast is a key word here. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make a difference who arrives first. It\u2019s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,\u201d Keyes said. Then you might want to call up your carrier while you\u2019re waiting. Depending on your spot in line, it might be faster to get through to a call center. \u201cWhatever happens first, great,\u201d he said. Calls to US domestic numbers might have really long waits. Keyes suggested trying an international call center for your carrier instead. \u201cMost US-based travelers aren\u2019t thinking to call the Canadian help line for Delta. You might get through to an agent much quicker. They can all handle your reservations just the same.\u201d You can also use a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines says. \u201cScan your boarding pass or enter your record locator to see your updated trip details. From there you can also switch your flight and print your new boarding passes.\u201d The travel advice website Travel Lens suggests using social media to your advantage. \u201cNot all customer service teams are as helpful as they should be and getting in touch with them via a phone call isn\u2019t always easy,\u201d it told CNN Travel in an email. \u201cAirlines value their reputation on social media and platforms like Twitter [now X] are a great way to get in contact with an employee. If you do use Twitter to reach out, then it\u2019s important to remain polite and calm as this will work in your favor.\u201d Attitude and research matter  Whether you\u2019re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference. That starts with attitude. \u201cHoney attracts more flies than vinegar,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cLook at this from the airline agents\u2019 perspective. They\u2019ve been dealing with irate customers really since the pandemic began. The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. \u201cAsking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.\u201d He had another tip when it\u2019s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: \u201cCome prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.\u201d Your agent can expedite things if you\u2019ve already looked up new routes and possible suggestions while you\u2019ve been waiting.  If you\u2019ve booked through Expedia or another third-party site, you\u2019ll have to deal through them when there\u2019s a cancellation.  If the price is the same, Keyes suggested you book directly with the airline. In case something goes wrong, \u201cit makes it much more complicated with multiple sets of policies\u201d when you booked via a third party. US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, suggests you avoid layovers when booking if possible. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong. The group also backs up the advice from Keyes to be nice and polite to agents but also says consumers should be persistent in trying to get the situation resolved satisfactorily.   Help from other airlines Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor. \u201cWhen flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier\u2019s flight because they have interline agreements,\u201d Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.  \u201cThis means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.\u201d \u201cIf you elect not to be accommodated on a later flight and you book a new ticket out of your own pocket, you are entitled to a cash refund, though that may not help you get to where you need to go,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAs we all know, last-minute flights are very expensive.\u201d Trapped for the night   What do you do if it looks like you\u2019re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you\u2019re not in your home city? \u201cAsk the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It\u2019s not required by law,\u201d Keyes said.  They\u2019re less likely to do it if it\u2019s weather related, he said, than if the problem is a mechanical issue with the plane or staffing issues. Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments.     Get to know policies. For instance, Delta Air Lines says it will provide a hotel voucher in some circumstances when the delay is between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.  Whatever you do, at least ask, Keyes said. A voucher for hotels and even ground transport and meals aren\u2019t likely to just be offered. Also, your credit card could be your friend in this situation. \u201cThe good news is that many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.\u201d Smith said. \u201cThese travel protections are typically included automatically as long as you used the card to pay for your flight. Google your credit card plus travel protections to see what specific offerings your card carries.\u201d If your flight is delayed instead of outright canceled, you might want to weigh whether to wait at the airport. Depending your personal circumstances, hunkering down there for five or six hours might be easier than going to and from a hotel. Also, Keyes said, check whether there is a hotel within the airport. The Points Guy advises trying to get into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily. Stay safe. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous. Frustrating though it is to stay put, it\u2019s always better to arrive late than not at all. Travel insurance and receipts Consider buying travel insurance, advises Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel. It said \u201cmost travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.\u201d  The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later.  But keep it to the basics. \u201cAirlines only pay for \u2018reasonable\u2019 expenses though, so you are unlikely to get money back for purchases such as alcohol, expensive meals or extravagant hotels. \u201c  Refund entitlements for your flight The US Department of Transportation says you are entitled to a refund of your ticket cost because of a cancellation or \u201csignificant delay\u201d or \u201csignificant change\u201d to your flight and you choose not to travel. This is the policy for cancellations regardless of the reason the airline cancels. In cases of \u201csignificant\u201d delays or changes to itineraries, what constitutes \u201csignificant\u201d remains open to interpretation and depends on a number of factors. New federal rules say travelers deserve cash refunds when inconvenienced by their airline \u2013 not vouchers or travel credits. \u201cFrom now on when your flight is canceled for any reason, you are entitled to an automatic cash refund and it has to be prompt,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN when the new rule was announced in April. Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of AirHelp, said in an email to CNN Travel before the new rules came into effect that flyers should try to avoid vouchers. \u201cIf travelers are denied boarding, they should not volunteer their seat in exchange for perks or a voucher. If they do, they could be giving up their right to any additional compensation,\u201d Pawliszyn said. \u201cOf course, if the airline makes a compelling enough offer, they may prefer to take it.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2021/12/27/travel/what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Yostin Andres Mosquera, a 34-year-old Colombian national, was arrested in Bristol early Saturday and charged on Monday, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The remains were found in suitcases at Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol last week, as well as at Mosquera\u2019s address in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, a neighborhood in west London.

{"id": "2024_07_18_tech_att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws", "text": "This week, AT&T notified millions of customers that their data was likely stolen in an April leak that the company disclosed earlier this month. Meanwhile, comprehensive laws that would protect customers from hacks keep struggling to pass, as AT&T and its rivals have fought back against and heavily influenced a patchwork of data laws \u2013 arguing the approach has failed to rein in the problem. AT&T customers\u2019 pilfered information was so valuable to cybercriminals that the FBI asked the company to delay filing a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission because of potential national security and public safety concerns. The data was breached from \u201cnearly all\u201d of AT&T\u2019s cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022. It\u2019s not the first time \u2013 even this year \u2013 that AT&T has been breached. The company was already grappling with an unrelated data leak that took place in March. At that time, AT&T said personal information, such as Social Security numbers on 73 million current and former customers, was released onto the dark web. Consumer advocates and some lawmakers have long argued for more protection of customer data. Though state laws have passed across almost 20 states, \u00a0the patchwork of regulations across states and agencies that regulates data privacy, can lead to inconsistencies, contradictions and lacunae. Complicating things further, lobbies from Big Tech to phone carriers have been heavily influencing many of these state and local regulation efforts. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cWe have long supported a comprehensive federal privacy policy protecting all Americans that applies across the internet ecosystem. We continue to believe that a federal privacy policy should establish a consistent set of protections, enforced by a single regulator, for all consumers.\u201d Lobbies are at the \u2018crux of the problem\u2019 Keepers of private information like who you texted, what you\u2019re watching \u2013 in addition to your address and Social Security number \u2013 makes telecom companies\u2019 data a high-value target. \u00a0That could be invaluable data for phishing and targeted scam attempts. The data phone carriers hold is \u201cthe gateway into everything else on the internet,\u201d Dominic Sellitto, a cyber security professor at University at Buffalo, said. \u201cEvery communication that we have, everything goes through a telecom provider or internet service provider.\u201d And that wealth of data draws hackers. \u201cThese larger companies, because of their size and the treasure trove of data, certainly have a target on their backs,\u201d Sellitto noted. They\u2019re not alone: In just the past year, large cyberattacks have frozen car dealerships and delayed ambulances. Currently, data privacy laws exist in 19 states covering at least 150 million Americans, though differing in scale and scope. There are federal regulations on specific areas of privacy, like laws covering medical data or information about children, and agencies like the FCC regulate telecommunications. But there is no large, comprehensive data privacy law at the federal level, and many state laws are basically written by industries through their lobbyists, said Alan Butler, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cThe crux of the problem in legislating telecoms is the lobbyists and their effectiveness over many, many decades,\u201d said Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath. Cybersecurity and data privacy go hand in hand. The heaviest proposed regulation would impose data minimization rules \u2014 meaning if companies collected less data, there would be less available for hackers to steal in the first place. There would also be stricter data security and notification rules if a hack does happen. It\u2019s unclear whether those rules would have prevented AT&T\u2019s hacks or better protected their customers. But consumer advocates have lambasted the telecom industry for getting in the way of more comprehensive laws. Trade groups stressed that realistic privacy laws have had success passing through many states. \u201cIn the absence of workable federal data privacy legislation, our multi-sector coalition is proud to have been one of many stakeholders that have worked on a comprehensive privacy framework that now covers well over 100 million Americans and has received overwhelming bipartisan support across state legislatures with dramatically different political dynamics,\u201d Andrew Kingman, counsel to the State Privacy and Security Coalition said in a statement. Industry trade groups say that while cyber security and data privacy can be interrelated, there is tension between those concepts that might not be fully covered in a data privacy law. What it\u2019s like trying to pass data privacy laws When Collin Walke, a data privacy and cybersecurity attorney, was in the Oklahoma House, he focused on data privacy legislation. After California passed its landmark data privacy law in 2018, he attempted to get similar legislation passed in his state. \u201cWe had lobbyists from Amazon. We had lobbyists from Google. We had all of that. But the number one impediment to us getting it passed in Oklahoma was AT&T and Verizon,\u201d Walke said to CNN. Verizon declined to comment. In a statement, Amazon said it supports \u201cU.S. federal privacy legislation that requires transparency, access to one\u2019s own personal information, and the ability to delete personal information, and prohibits the sale of personal data without consent. In the absence of congressional action, we support well-crafted state laws that protect consumers\u2019 privacy, while continuing to allow for innovation.\u201d Monica Priestley, a state representative in Vermont, said lobbyists from across industries \u201ccame out in full force at the last minute,\u201d even hosting webinars and calls at the town or city level, against a landmark privacy bill this year. One lobby, the State Privacy & Security Coalition, represents AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Meta, as well as automobile, healthcare and payment card companies. The Vermont governor vetoed the bill in June, which would have been one of the strongest in the country. Industry trade groups said that the ability to sue companies for data violations and strict data minimization requirements would have been too costly for Vermont small businesses to comply to. \u201cThe hardest part about these bills is they are so technical in nature, and the industry tends to hand the state a policy and encourage them to run with that,\u201d Priestley said. \u201cIndustries created this monster that is out of control, and they themselves are at risk. And something\u2019s got to change.\u201d Why doesn\u2019t a national privacy law exist? Advocates say Big Tech lobbies and telecommunications lobbies have shifted their focus from squashing the federal conversation to getting deeply involved at the state level. \u201cA national law puts everyone on a level playing field,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cIt establishes the baseline of what good looks like for these critical infrastructure providers, including telecommunications companies, and then it gives the government a standard to enforce.\u201d Advocates for a sweeping law say the average consumer shouldn\u2019t have to parse dense user agreements to find out what is going on with their data. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cOur customers can manage how we use and share their information for certain activities including advertising and marketing, and can opt out at any time.\u201d But tighter regulations mean companies must spend more resources beefing up their cybersecurity. Companies also lobby against allowing individuals to sue for damages. A lot of a telecommunication company\u2019s business is rooted in the data brokerage market, multiple privacy experts told CNN. And it\u2019s valuable data. \u201cLike many other industries, the telecommunications industry sees the commercialization of data for advertising uses as an additional revenue source,\u201d Butler said. In April, the FCC fined AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing customers\u2019 personal data without their consent. The fines stem from allegations in 2020 by the Federal Communications Commission that for years, the companies had improperly shared users\u2019 geolocation histories to third parties, including to prisons, as part of their commercial programs. In response to the FCC fines, all of the wireless carriers said they expect to appeal the decision. The FCC is also not the only regulator for telecom companies, which can be giant entities. \u201cIt\u2019s a very opaque space that is begging for clarity, and that clarity can only come through regulation,\u201d Noonan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/tech/att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_gambia-upholds-fgm-ban-intl", "text": "Gambia\u2019s parliament has voted to uphold a landmark law that bans female genital mutilation (FGM) in the largely Muslim nation, after religious groups pushed for the legislation to be repealed. If Monday\u2019s bid had been successful, the tiny West African country would have been the first in the world to relegalize FGM after criminalizing it. MP Amadou Camara, who chairs a joint health and gender committee that recommended that FGM should remain outlawed, told CNN that none of the clauses seeking the repeal of the ban in the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed. Parliament Speaker Fabakary Jatta\u00a0ruled that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the bill, which passed a second reading four months ago, to be read a third time and to pass without those clauses. \u201cI so rule that the bill is rejected, and the legislative process exhausted,\u201d Jatta said at plenary meeting Monday. FGM was prohibited in Gambia in 2015 by former president Yahya Jammeh who authorized the\u00a0imposition of fines and prison sentences\u00a0of up to three years for individuals who engaged in it. The law also punished perpetrators with life sentences in cases where the practice led to death. Pro-Islamic groups and lawmakers pushed back against the criminalization, saying that female circumcision was \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d Other prominent Gambians, such as opposition leader and former interior minister Mai Ahmad Fatty also defended the practice, arguing that: \u201cThere is no FGM in Gambia. We circumcise, not mutilate.\u201d Human rights organization Amnesty International earlier described efforts to revoke the FGM ban as a \u201cbackward move\u201d for the protection of human rights in the country. In Gambia, 73% of women aged between 15 and 49 years had experienced FGM as of 2020, according to the United Nations. More than 65% of those women were subjected to the practice \u201cbefore the age of five years,\u201d the UN said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Women\u2019s Day in March that he was \u201coutraged\u201d by moves by Gambia\u2019s parliament to legalize FGM, describing the practice as \u201chorrific.\u201d Despite the ban, FGM has still been performed on children in parts of the country. Last year, three women were convicted of performing the practice on eight female minors\u00a0and ordered to pay fines of around 15,000 Gambian Dalasi ($220) each or face a one-year jail sentence. The penalties were\u00a0reported\u00a0to have been paid by an Islamic cleric. In 2016, two women also faced charges\u00a0after a 5-month-old girl died from genital mutilation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/gambia-upholds-fgm-ban-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_europe_putin-summer-residence-fortification", "text": "As Ukraine grows bolder in striking targets deep inside Russia, Moscow has quietly upped the security measures around President Vladmir Putin\u2019s country residence north of Moscow. Satellite images have revealed that several Pantsir-S1 air defense systems have been installed in the vicinity of the presidential residence on Lake Valdai in Novgorod region. The Valdai residence could be a high-profile target, as Putin is known to be spending time there during the summer. The palatial property sits inside a large government vacation resort in the Valdai national park, on a peninsula wedged between two lakes. Access to the whole complex is severely restricted \u2013 the 40 hectares of grounds are surrounded by water on three sides and fenced off from the rest of the park. First reported by Radio Liberty, satellite images show the Russian-made Pantsir-S1s have been moved into the area at some point between last September and this May, just as Ukraine became better at developing and using drones capable of striking deeper inside Russia. Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies show air defenses strategically positioned in the area, including on a tower located deep in a forest just a few kilometers away from the compound. The Pantsir-S1 systems are designed to combat short-range cruise missiles and drones, suggesting the move to station them near the residence may be a response to Ukraine\u2019s increasingly audacious drone attacks. CNN has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment but has not received a response. Kyiv has recently been given permission to use Western weapons to strike across the border into Russia, but this is limited to military targets that are near the border with the Ukrainian Kharkiv region\u00a0and are supporting Russia\u2019s offensive in Ukraine. For any strikes deeper into Russia than that, Ukraine must rely on its own weapons. Drones are a big part of the strategy. Ukraine\u2019s drone program has grown significantly since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. What began with efforts to modify cheap, off-the-shelf drones that could be used for surveillance has turned into the development of long-range attack drones that are capable of striking hundreds of miles beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders. So far this year, Kyiv has claimed that Ukrainian drones sank or severely damaged several Russian warships in the Black Sea and caused damage to the Kerch Strait bridge between Russia and Ukraine\u2019s Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. The Ukrainian military has also managed to destroy fuel depots, military targets and energy infrastructure much further afield. In April, it said its drones hit the Niznekamsk oil refinery \u2013 one of the five largest in Russia \u2013 in Tatarstan region, more than 1,100 km (700 miles) from the border. And last month, the Ukrainian military said it had destroyed one of Russia\u2019s newest and most advanced fighter jets, the Sukhoi Su-57 fighter, with a drone strike almost 600 kilometers (372 miles) behind the front lines. \u201cUkrainian drone strikes deep within Russia continue to pressure Russia\u2019s air defense umbrella and force the Russian military command to prioritize allocating limited air defense assets to cover what it deems to be high-value targets,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based group, said in a battlefield update on Wednesday, pointing to the decision by Russia to move the Pantsir-S1 systems there. The presidential residence is well protected from would-be invaders. Access to the complex is severely restricted \u2013 the 40 hectares of grounds are surrounded by water on three sides and fenced off from the rest of the park. A special permit is required to access the wider park and the resort is completely off-limits \u2013 according to its official website, it has been closed indefinitely since last November. The retreat\u2019s history as a vacation destination for Russia\u2019s top officials dates back to the time of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who had a dacha \u2013 or summer house \u2013 built in the area, according to the Russian Presidential Property Management Department, the body that manages the holiday complex. Nikita Khrushchev and Boris Yeltsin both enjoyed time at the residence, according to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/putin-summer-residence-fortification/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_style_skywalkers-rooftopping-documentary-culture-queue", "text": "What was your most thrilling first date? In 2016, two young Russians known for their extreme \u201crooftopping\u201d adventures \u2014 where they attempt to illegally climb vertiginous landmarks like La Sagrada Familia and the Eiffel Tower \u2014 skipped the perfunctory happy hour cocktail and instead ascended China\u2019s tallest incomplete skyscraper, the 1,957-foot-high Goldin Finance 117. At the time, Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau didn\u2019t know they\u2019d end up together. Beerkus had invited Nikolau, a rare female member of the rooftopping community (she was scaling the proverbial glass wall before breaking it), to join him for the climb to produce sponsored social media posts. But it was the beginning of a long romantic and creative partnership, which has led them to travel thousands of miles\u00a0\u2014 and thousands of feet in the air \u2014 together. Eight years later, the documentary film \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d takes an intimate look at their unusual romance through hundreds of hours of footage that, of course, includes heart-dropping POV footage from impossible heights and the occasional run-in with law enforcement. Like all couples, Beerkus and Nikolau have their ups and downs, and when they argue the stakes are a just bit higher than most (in one scene, Beerkus\u00a0bravely accuses his girlfriend of being \u201ctoo negative\u201d as she gears up to nail a precarious acrobatic pose literally above the clouds). Through the pair\u2019s unusual lifestyles, \u201cSkywalkers\u201d becomes a meditation on trust and commitment, though their stunts will also get your palms sweaty, if that\u2019s your thing. Directed by Jeff Zimbalist, a filmmaker with rooftopping experience of his own, and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, \u201dSkywalkers\u201d debuted at Sundance Film Festival in January and is now streaming on Netflix. It follows the couple, who utilize Nikolau\u2019s background as a trained gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the fear of falling from heights, but more about the fear of falling in love,\u201d Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. \u201cAngela first told me that they were\u2026 competitors and rivals. But you could sense under the surface that there was this bubbling flirtation there.\u201d An architectural dare As the documentary progresses, the pair plot out their most difficult climb yet: Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Merdeka 118, the world\u2019s second-tallest building. The gleaming 2,227-foot-tall tower, which opened earlier this year, is crowned with a 527-foot-tall spire whose apex is only accessible via a narrow internal ladder. In 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau made their plans, the \u201csupertall\u201d skyscraper had topped out but was still under construction. Evading security and reaching its apogee safely required an intense and elaborate scheme \u2014 one conjured while they worked through relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the tower\u2019s owner said police were investigating the pair for trespassing, although Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN about whether further legal action was taken.) Rooftopping is a contentious pastime \u2014 both for the danger it poses and participants\u2019 reliance on illegal trespassing.  With the urban \u201csport\u201d emerging as one more of the more extreme ways to get likes on social media, several harrowing deaths have followed. For \u201cSkywalkers\u201d the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his team\u2019s safety measures, which were designed to ensure the crew neither endangered themselves nor presented any distractions for the couple. \u201cWe talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, \u2018Please, don\u2019t go do anything additionally crazy beyond what you would usually do,\u2019\u201d Zimbalist said. \u201cBecause to us, this isn\u2019t a movie about whether or not you succeed at Merdeka or any other climb\u2026 the genuine suspense here is if you choose to trust each other.\u201d An \u2018expanded state of mind\u2019 For the couple, rooftopping isn\u2019t just about thrill-seeking. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, says in the film that pushing herself to her limits was engrained from childhood and that she is always striving to better herself. For Beerkus, who scaled buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity. \u201cThe higher I went, the easier it was to breathe,\u201d he says to camera, recalling his earliest climbs. \u201cThis extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it\u2019s essential for me.\u201d Zimbalist recognizes the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not\u00a0 about\u00a0\u201cdefending what they do against critics.\u201d Instead, he hope that \u201dSkywalkers,\u201d in addition to its message on love and trust, provides a rare look at the hard work and planning behind the rooftoppers\u2019 \u201cpolished\u201d social media posts. \u201cWith any activity that\u2019s dangerous, social media tends to disguise the difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cTelling the story behind a stunt helps to give context and just how challenging and how dangerous some of these things are.\u201d Believe it or not, Nikolau maintains that she is afraid of heights, something she has had to confront repeatedly to keep up with her chosen line of work. \u201cThe fear never really went away; I just got better and better at facing it,\u201d she explains in one clip. So while the makers of \u201cSkywalkers\u201d would probably rather you don\u2019t climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare \u2014 and say \u201cyes\u201d to the thing that scares us the most. \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d is available to watch on Netflix Add to Queue: Such great heights WATCH: \u201cFree Solo\u201d (2018) If you prefer watching daring feats on rock cliffs instead of skyscrapers, this Academy Award-winning documentary by filmmaker Chai Vasarhelyi and photographer-mountaineer Jimmy Chin follows climber Alex Honnold as he prepares to summit Yosemite\u2019s very vertical 3,000-foot-tall rock formation, El Capitan, without a rope or a harness.

{"id": "2024_07_18_middleeast_israel-us-biden-knesset-vote-palestinian-state-intl", "text": "The Biden administration received another rebuff from Israel Wednesday night \u2013 this time from the country\u2019s parliament \u2013 over the United States\u2019 long-standing support for the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state. A two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been US policy for decades, but absent negotiations between the two sides, and a lack of sustained effort by the US to make it happen, means faith in such an outcome has dwindled. On Wednesday evening, the Israeli parliament made clear its position, voting by 68 to 9 to reject any creation of a Palestinian state. \u201cThe Knesset of Israel firmly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state west of the Jordan (river). The establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the Land of Israel would pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region,\u201d the declaration read. Among those who backed it was Benny Gantz, an opponent of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Gantz\u2019s vote serves as a blow to those in Washington who see him as someone more inclined to seek a negotiated peace with Palestinians if he ever became Israel\u2019s leader. Instead, the resolution was \u201ca signal to the international community that pressure to impose a Palestinian state on Israel is futile,\u201d leader of the right-wing opposition \u2018New Hope\u2019 party, Gideon Saar, said, according to the Haaretz newspaper. The Palestinian Authority foreign ministry condemned the Knesset vote, saying it was time \u201cthe international consensus on the two-state solution (was) translated into practical steps to resolve the conflict \u2026 before it is too late.\u201d The Biden administration, while standing strong in its support for Israel and Netanyahu throughout the war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, has tried to stick to its long-held line that a two-state solution is in the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians. Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea. A day after speaking with Biden in a phone conversation in January, the Israeli leader posted on X, \u201cI will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan. And this is contrary to (the creation of) a Palestinian state.\u201d The Knesset declaration \u2013 which follows a similar vote in February opposing international recognition of a Palestinian state \u2013 is not legally binding, but pollster and analyst Dahlia Scheindlin says its symbolic importance should not be dismissed. \u201cIt is Israel trying to create a fact on the ground \u2013 which does not exist \u2013 that Israel has the power to determine whether Palestinians exist, or exist as a state,\u201d she says, referring also to remarks from finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, last year that there\u2019s \u201cno such thing as a Palestinian people.\u201d \u201cWe need to stop accepting the Israeli rhetoric that there is such a thing as unilateral Palestinian statehood. What we have is multilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood and unilateral Israeli rejection,\u201d Scheindlin says. While international leaders have repeatedly condemned the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, which killed 1,200 people and saw 250 more taken hostage, some countries have also made significant foreign policy shifts in recent months to recognize a Palestinian state. Making such an announcement in May, in a co-ordinated move with Spain and Ireland, Norway\u2019s foreign minister framed the move in part as a response to Israeli intransigence on peace talks. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\u201d Espen Barth Eide said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/middleeast/israel-us-biden-knesset-vote-palestinian-state-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Only a win for his party would ensure \u201cpeace\u201d in the country, Maduro said, adding that he expects \u201cirreversible results\u201d in his favor. CNN has reached out to Maduro\u2019s office for further comment on his statements. Maduro\u2019s remarks come as his government attempts to cling on to power for another six years while facing a credible challenge from opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia. Many experts believe the opposition has a real chance of pushing Maduro out of office. In the run up to the vote, Venezuela has \u201cunjustly detained\u201d democratic opposition figures, civil society members and journalists, according to the US State Department, which called for their release in a statement Wednesday. Strongman Maduro has been in power in for more than a decade, having assumed the presidency following the death of predecessor Hugo Chavez in 2013, during which time his government has often been accused of rigging votes and silencing the opposition. The 2018 election that returned Maduro to office was largely boycotted by the opposition. The poll was described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States and as a \u201cfarce\u201d by the Organization of American States. There were hopes the 2024 election might be different after Maduro promised Washington last year in a historic agreement that he would hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief. However, more recently the opposition has accused him of reneging on that pledge. Two opposition candidates \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 have been barred from running while a report this week by a human rights group suggested there had been a spate of \u201carbitrary detentions\u201d since the beginning of the campaign season on July 4. Human rights NGO Laboratorio de Paz reported Monday there had been 71 arbitrary detentions in the first 10 days of campaigning, the majority of them involving people who had provided some type of service to the campaign command of the opposition candidate Gonz\u00e1lez, of the Democratic Unitary Platform. Two days after Laboratorio\u2019s report came out, the barred opposition leader Machado said in a post on X that her security chief had also been arrested. Machado said her security chief Milciades \u00c1vila was \u201ckidnapped\u201d on Wednesday \u201cby the Maduro regime and accused of gender violence against some women.\u201d The opposition leader said the women who accuse \u00c1vila of gender violence tried to \u201cattack\u201d her and Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia in a restaurant last Saturday. \u201cThere are dozens of witnesses and videos that demonstrate that this was a planned provocation to leave us without protection 11 days before July 28,\u201d Machado wrote. CNN has reached out to Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office for comment on \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and to determine whether he has legal representation. The US was concerned about \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and called for his immediate release, a State Department spokesperson said Wednesday. The US also urged Venezuela to release all those who were \u201cunjustly detained\u201d during the presidential election campaign. Costa Rica, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Panama meanwhile called on Venezuelan authorities to guarantee that elections are \u201cfree, fair, and transparent,\u201d in a joint statement released Wednesday by the Alliance for Development in Democracy. CNN has asked the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry for a response to the joint statement. Maduro is one of 10 candidates vying for the presidency, however, several of them have minimal support and are viewed by the main opposition as government allies.

Similarly, last week, Monroe arrived at the LA premiere of the 1990s-inspired serial killer thriller dressed in a Courr\u00e8ges leather sarong and matching bra. Both outfits seemed like a bold choice for what is shaping up to be a sweltering summer across many parts of the Northern Hemisphere. But Monroe isn\u2019t alone in choosing this unseasonal material. Despite it being July, Mia Goth \u2014 another veritable scream queen \u2014 opted for a leather corseted midi dress from Versace for her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live earlier this month. And at the premiere of \u201cMaXXXine\u201d in LA, Goth wore an edgy Ludovic de saint Sernin halter-neck dress \u2014 the main event being her peek-a-boo leather bralet. You don\u2019t have to be a horror film starlet to pull off a summer leather look, either. On July 11, Kate Hudson was snapped in Manhattan\u2019s Soho in a sultry pair of lace-up leather pants; while across the pond, British radio and TV presenter Vick Hope arrived at Wimbledon in a full burgundy leather vest, shorts and a collarless leather overcoat (granted, London\u2019s weather has been a little more accommodating to leather this summer). Rita Ora \u2014 who has, it seems, committed to exclusively wearing scarlet in promotion of her new film \u201cDescents: The Rise of Red\u201d \u2014 wore not one, but two entirely leather outfits around New York. At what point did we start to see the off-season potential of leather? Once a firm staple of winter wardrobes, the material is seemingly summer\u2019s hottest trend. It began with Bottega Veneta, the Italian fashion house largely credited with pushing the boundary of the textile \u2014 symbolically and literally. In September 2022, creative director Matthieu Blazy sent a stream of leather optical illusions down the Fall-Winter runway.\u00a0Since then, we\u2019ve had blue jeans, plaid shirts and woven beach bags rendered in meticulous detail, redefining what leather could be. Or could it be a case of a trickle-down effect from our reigning pop stars? Dua Lipa opened her Glastonbury Festival headliner set in a custom Chrome Hearts leather mini-dress; while Rosal\u00eda \u2014 also known to her fleet of fans as Motomami \u2014 wore a pair of high-shine leather pants for her Coachella set in Palm Springs. Charli XCX, creator of the unequivocal album of the summer, \u201cBrat,\u201d has spoken openly about her love for scuffed-up YSL leather coats, and is often spotted off-duty donning a variety of biker jackets. Wherever the trend has come from, one thing is for certain: A leather jacket is no longer just for Christmas, but all year round.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/style/leather-clothes-summer-trend-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_style_ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian", "text": "India\u2019s most anticipated wedding of the year came to an end on Sunday after a star-studded three-day celebration that even saw the country\u2019s prime minister arrive to bless the young couple. Billionaire heir Anant Ambani married his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant in Mumbai in a lavish ceremony attended by Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, two former British prime ministers, Indian sporting legends and some of Bollywood\u2019s most famous faces. The wedding was followed by a blessing ceremony on Saturday, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi bestowed the young couple and their families with well wishes. The weekend\u2019s festivities concluded Sunday with an extravagant reception, or \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d (festival of bliss), as attendees jetted out of Mumbai. No expense was spared by the family that owns India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. The Ambani-owned 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Centre, which hosted wedding events throughout the weekend, was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, featuring floral installations and extravagant sets embellished with gold and silver. The couple underwent multiple outfit changes across the three-day bash, appearing in a succession of intricate, custom-made pieces celebrating the country\u2019s heritage and culture. Merchant\u2019s bridal ensemble was designed by Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and featured ivory zardozi (an elaborate type of metal embroidery) on silk and a 5-meter (16.4-foot) veil. She completed the look with jewels that aunts and sister wore to their own weddings. She later changed into an opulent red and gold outfit for her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family. Ambani meanwhile arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers. For the marriage ceremony, he wore a custom red sherwani by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, with a large green necklace draped around his neck. For Saturday\u2019s blessings ceremony, Merchant once again donned a custom piece by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, who collaborated with contemporary artist and sculptor Jayasri Burman to create a one-of-a-kind piece embroidered with real gold. The garment celebrates the couple\u2019s union \u201cthrough deeply meaningful imagery,\u201d Merchant\u2019s stylist Rhea Kapoor wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe human figures representing the happy couple radiate a celestial aura that honors the divinity in their humanity. The fauna depicts Anant\u2019s fondness for animals, particularly elephants that are considered auspicious and beautiful.\u201d For the reception Sunday, guests interpreted the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code by mixing classic Indian fashion with contemporary styles. Merchant wore a gold metallic corset from Dolce and Gabbana\u2019s Alta Moda couture line, along with a skirt and dupatta in the same shade by Indian designer Anamika Khanna. Months of planning It is not known precisely how much the Ambanis spent on the celebrations, which included months of pre-wedding parties, though industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Insiders worked for months to bring the couple\u2019s vision to life, collaborating with the family to bring the intricate details \u2014 from the floral arrangements to the set designs \u2014 together. Renowned wedding designer Preston Bailey, who has worked with Serena Williams and LeBron James, was commissioned to create larger-than-life floral art installations for the weekend. Speaking to CNN via email ahead of Friday\u2019s ceremony, Bailey commended Ambani\u2019s mother Nita\u2019s attention to detail. It was \u201cnothing short of pure genius and she is really focused on bringing the vast creative talent of India to the world through these weddings,\u201d he said. The inspiration for Bailey\u2019s designs came from the couple\u2019s love for animals and Ambani\u2019s recently opened animal sanctuary, Vantara, in the western Indian city of Jamnagar. His sculptural creations included a giant display of hot air balloons and more than 60 floral animals, including giraffes, two huge toucans, monkeys perched on trees inside the venue and a giant horse made from red and pink flowers. \u201cI have been in business for over 40 years \u2026 (but) I have never seen anything as intricate as this wedding and I believe it will bring such positive feedback and awareness to the great creative culture of artists of India,\u201d said Bailey, who also worked on the weddings of Ambani\u2019s two older siblings, Akash and Isha. Top Indian couturier and the wedding\u2019s creative director, Manish Malhotra, earlier told CNN that \u201cmaintaining the essence of India\u201d had been his \u201cguiding principle.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet (a traditional evening of music and dance that saw a performance from Justin Bieber) to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he said via email. Criticism and sustainability Details of the celebrations dominated local news headlines and set social media abuzz, but many within India \u2014 the world\u2019s most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people \u2014 criticized the opulence on show in a country with a glaring wealth gap and where millions live in poverty. \u201cShame on people celebrating income inequality in a country where we need wealth redistribution,\u201d tweeted comedian and social media critic, Shamita Yadav, who posts on social media as The Ranting Gola. \u201cWe are really a poor country,\u201d Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, Sushant Singh, told Indian news outlet The Wire. \u201cThis is something which is completely unacceptable. But the fact of the matter is half of India\u2019s big media is owned by Mr. Ambani, so it is unlikely that India\u2019s big media is going to say that this is horrible.\u201d Beyond the financial cost of the wedding and festivities is another, less visible cost: the one to the planet. An average Indian wedding of 300 people typically generates between 1.5 tons and 2 tons of waste, and around 30 to 40 tons of carbon emission \u2014 before taking guest travel into consideration \u2014 according to Ashwin Malwade, co-founder of Greenmyna, a Mumbai-based sustainable wedding consultancy. Sources of emissions include large-scale banquets and energy used by extravagant light displays. An event as huge in scale as the Ambani-Merchant celebration would emit far more carbon than even the largest and most lavish Indian wedding, he added. Then there\u2019s the travel, with several high-profile attendees pictured leaving Mumbai via Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport\u2019s private jet terminal. Malwade also pointed to the environmental footprint of the Ambanis\u2019 pre-wedding bash in Jamnagar, attended by public figures from around the world, including Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump, Bill Gates and Karlie Kloss; the four-day cruise arranged for guests in the Mediterranean; and the emissions required to fly in singers like Rihanna and Justin Bieber to perform at various events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/style/ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_world_school-uniforms-africa-education-cnnheroes", "text": "Sometimes, a book can have a life-changing impact. For Payton McGriff, that turned out to be true. McGriff was a sophomore at the University of Idaho when she read Half the Sky, which examines the oppression of women in developing countries. She was shocked to learn that 129 million girls worldwide are not enrolled in school. \u201cIn much of the world, women and girls are responsible for the lion\u2019s share of household duties and so a woman\u2019s perceived value is what she can contribute to the home,\u201d said McGriff, now 29. \u201cIt\u2019s seen that girls won\u2019t ever be putting (their) education to use.\u201d Additionally, many impoverished families who want to educate their daughters can\u2019t afford tuition fees, school supplies, and the uniform mandated in many countries. \u201cA uniform is typically one of the more expensive pieces,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cThey can be one of the most cost-effective ways to keep girls in school.\u201d Studies have shown that providing free uniforms can reduce dropout rates by 16 percent and absenteeism by more than 35 percent. This simple solution took root in McGriff\u2019s mind and started her journey helping women and girls transform their lives. Today, her nonprofit, Style Her Empowered \u2013 known as SHE \u2013 provides 1,500 girls a year in the African country of Togo with free uniforms, school fees, supplies, tutoring, and much more. More than a college project A marketing major, McGriff was pursuing her dream job in business when she took an entrepreneurship class her senior year. Tasked with creating a business or nonprofit for a class project, she remembered the notion of the school uniform and developed an idea. She sought feedback from Romuald Afatchao, a professor from Togo, and he encouraged her to join a spring break trip to his hometown of N\u00f4tse to do field research. There, McGriff saw the reality of what girls faced. She met Elolo, a young woman who started her chores at 3:30 a.m. so she could attend school and did homework by streetlight at night since her house had no electricity. Her family\u2019s financial struggles meant she eventually had to quit school so her brothers could continue. \u201cIt made all of the stories that you read in the book so real,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cTalent and resilience and resourcefulness is so equally distributed worldwide, but opportunity is not.\u201d McGriff interviewed groups of girls about obstacles that made attending school difficult. They mentioned a lack of money and support, but when she asked about uniforms, the reaction was immediate. \u201cEvery girl stood up and raised her hand so high and, not only that, told a very expressive story about how she had been shamed out of school because she didn\u2019t have her uniform,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized, \u2018Okay, this is a place to start.\u2019\u201d McGriff returned home, pitched her education project at entrepreneurship competitions, won $35,000 in seed money, and eventually turned down her dream job to bring her vision to life. She graduated in May 2017 and returned to Togo. The \u2018uniform that grows\u2019 That first year, the group hired local seamstresses and provided uniforms and school fees to 65 girls. But they soon ran into a problem. \u201cWe realized a problem that probably every parent on the planet would find obvious,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cOur students were outgrowing them very quickly.\u201d Her team wanted to create an adjustable uniform that could last students longer but couldn\u2019t find patterns that worked. Eventually, the seamstresses \u2013 with input from the students, McGriff, and others \u2013 designed their own solution, and the uniform that grows was born. The dress now has adjustable cords running along the side that create a tailored fit for every body type, while extra fabric hemmed underneath enables it to grow up to a foot in length. The uniform can fit a girl for up to three years, adjusting six sizes; when finally outgrown, it can be handed down to younger girls. What\u2019s more, 100% of the fabric scraps are recycled into reusable menstrual pads made by SHE seamstresses and distributed to the students, who previously stayed home from school during their period because they lacked sanitary supplies. Empowering girls and elevating women Today, SHE serves girls in N\u00f4tse as well as 20 rural villages in southern Togo, where 69 percent of households live below the poverty line. Girls in these areas are at a higher risk to drop out of school, so SHE strives to remove all financial barriers by also providing tuition fees and school supplies. Once enrolled, students receive weekly tutoring sessions. As a result, SHE\u2019s students consistently pass their exams at higher rates than the national average. \u201cOur students have increased their proficiency and performance in school dramatically,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cIf given the opportunity, they thrive.\u201d SHE continues to develop new ways of supporting their students. The group recently created a mobile learning lab that brings books and supplies to under-resourced communities, as well as afterschool Girls Clubs where student ambassadors are trained to run workshops for their peers. \u201cIt\u2019s all (done) with this tone of empowering girls and helping girls to understand their rights and their opportunities in society,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see our students really start to blossom.\u201d McGriff also brings opportunities to the women that SHE employs. Twenty seamstresses work full-time at the group\u2019s two factories, and their average salary is 75 percent higher than Togo\u2019s minimum wage. All employees get generous benefits, like unlimited paid sick leave, three-months paid maternity leave, and free childcare. And that\u2019s not all. On average, women in Togo only have around three years of education \u2013 about half that of men \u2013 and 55 percent are illiterate. When McGriff realized that most of the group\u2019s seamstresses had little formal education, she started a \u2018paid to learn\u2019 program to help teach them basic literacy, math, and financial skills. The seamstresses also travel to the villages with other staffers to help distribute uniforms and school supplies. They\u2019re proud of their role in helping girls get opportunities they didn\u2019t have. \u201cWatching them flourish is really just \u2026 incredibly inspiring,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re part of SHE, you\u2019re part of this movement.\u201d Locals taking the lead McGriff supervises the project remotely from Idaho, ensuring that the local women who run the program in Togo take the lead in shaping the organization. Eventually, McGriff hopes SHE can become self-sustaining so her role can be further reduced, which has been her goal from the beginning. \u201cThe vision for starting SHE was always for it to become locally led because local women understand the challenges and the solutions far better than I ever could,\u201d she said. \u201cI may have struck the original match that started SHE. But what I\u2019m so beyond inspired by is watching our team carry the torch.\u201d One important member of that team is Elolo, who McGriff met on her first visit to Togo. Elolo was the first girl enrolled in the program, eventually graduated from high school, and is now the group\u2019s Assistant Director and has recruited hundreds of girls to SHE. What\u2019s more, with her salary, she\u2019s been able to care for her family and install electricity in their home. Her success makes McGriff beam with pride. \u201cElolo is just the epitome of when you educate a girl, you educate a community,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is a role model for every girl in our program who can see themselves in her.\u201d McGriff eventually hopes to replicate SHE worldwide. Although she\u2019s thousands of miles away from the women she works with, she feels a strong sense of connection to them. \u201cWe are so bonded by this incredible work that we get to do together,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching each other explore our full potential. \u2026 It\u2019s so girl power. It\u2019s so fun.\u201d Want to get involved? Check out the Style Her Empowered website and see how to help.

{"id": "2024_07_19_travel_global-tech-outage-what-to-know-if-youre-traveling-this-weekend", "text": "Unexpected tech outages have been impacting airlines and airports across the world. Major hotel brands have also reported outages. Here\u2019s what to know if you\u2019re planning to travel this weekend. What\u2019s going on? Widespread IT problems are impacting global travel. It\u2019s believed the issue stems, at least in part, from a software update issued by software company CrowdStrike on Microsoft Windows operating systems. The CEO of CrowdStrike said in a statement obtained by CNN early Friday that the IT issue causing a global outage had been identified and a fix had been deployed. Meanwhile, Microsoft said the \u201cunderlying cause\u201d that led to the global outage \u201chas been fixed,\u201d but added that residual impact is still affecting some services. Airports, airlines and travelers across the globe continue to navigate the fall-out. Which airlines and airports are impacted? US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Airlines, SunCountry and Frontier Airlines all reported issues on Friday. American Airlines has since said it has \u201csafely reestablished\u201d operations, while United resumed \u201csome flights\u201d Friday morning. Delta Air Lines resumed some flight departures but additional delays and cancellations were expected Friday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement early Friday that was \u201cclosely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,\u201d adding that \u201cseveral airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.\u201d The agency provided an update later in the day: \u201cCurrently FAA operations are not impacted by the global IT issue. We continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d The\u00a0agency also said\u00a0the IT issue \u201ccould continue to affect flights this weekend.\u201d Ryanair, Air France and Turkish Airlines also reported issues, while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said the outages are \u201cmaking flight handling impossible.\u201d AirAsia said its \u201ccore reservation and check-in system\u201d have been impacted by the tech issues. Cirium, an aviation analytics company, said there were around 110,000 scheduled commercial flights Friday. By 3 p.m. ET, Cirium said there were more than 5,000 flights canceled globally. Many airports across the globe also logged tech-related issues. Dubai Airport reported issues on Friday morning, but the airport said in a post on X that normal operations had resumed. Passenger William Sikora III told CNN Friday morning that the situation at Philadelphia International Airport is \u201cabsolutely insane right now\u201d in the wake of the disruption. Airports across the US cautioned travelers to expect delays and to check their flight status before going to the airport. In Europe, London\u2019s Gatwick Airport said it is \u201caffected by the global Microsoft issues\u201d and that passengers may experience delays checking in and going through security. London\u2019s Heathrow Airport said it was working with \u201cairport colleagues to minimize the impact\u201d and advised passengers to check with their airlines for the latest flight information. Berlin Airport said it is experiencing delays to check-in, while Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport stated the impact on its airport is \u201cbeing mapped.\u201d Scotland\u2019s Edinburgh Airport said the outages mean \u201cwait times are longer than usual at the airport.\u201d Spain\u2019s airport authority, AENA, which supervises airports in Madrid, Barcelona and others across the country, said the tech issues \u201ccould cause delays\u201d and that its staff are working to solve the problems. Airports and airlines in Asia and Latin America were also reporting disruptions caused by the IT outage. This is not an exhaustive list, so it\u2019s best to check the status of any airports you\u2019ll be transiting through this weekend before you travel. This is also a fast-moving situation heading into Friday night and the weekend, so if you\u2019re planning on flying, it\u2019s best to keep tabs on your chosen airline\u2019s social media channels, apps and website for up-to-date information. Check your flight status before you head to the airport, if you can. How long will it take for things to get back to normal? Travel will likely take a while to get back on track, even once the outage is sorted. The stoppage of flights means that thousands of aircraft have been grounded around the world and could be stuck in the wrong airports. Crews have limits on their working hours, so staffing challenges cascade along with flight delays. Getting schedules back on track is a complicated process that can take several days to fully iron out. The best course of action is to monitor your airline for announcements and to know your rights as a consumer. What do I do if my flight is canceled? First off, if you can, check the status of your flight before you leave for the airport. It\u2019s better to find out your flight is canceled from the comfort of home or a hotel room and make new arrangements from there, if at all possible. If you\u2019re already at the airport, head to the airline help desk. While you\u2019re standing in line, it\u2019s worth phoning the airline help number and trying to contact the company via social media or email. If you are a member of an airline executive club and have access to a special phone number, now is the time to use it. If it looks like the airline won\u2019t be able to put you on a flight until the following day, ask for a hotel room or hotel voucher. There are fewer consumer protections for situations outside of airlines\u2019 control, but it\u2019s worth requesting. And if your airline seems to be impacted, but another airline is still operable \u2013 ask about flying with other carriers. \u201cWhen flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier\u2019s flight because they have interline agreements,\u201d Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel in our guide to flight cancellations, which you can read here. \u201cThis means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.\u201d If you can plausibly take a train rather than fly \u2013 for instance, if you\u2019re in the UK heading to mainland Europe \u2013 it could be worth checking last-minute ticket availability. What are my rights as an air traveler? That depends on where you\u2019re flying to and from \u2013 in the US, for example, passengers have the right to a refund for canceled flights, but additional compensation or accommodation for delays or cancellations outside of carriers\u2019 control is up to each airline. On flights to and from EU countries, the laws are different. If your airport of origin is within the EU or if you\u2019re arriving to the EU on an EU airline, you\u2019re entitled to a refund for delays longer than five hours and additional compensation for some shorter delays. Wherever you\u2019re traveling, it\u2019s worth familiarizing yourself with the airline terms and conditions associated with your booking. And if you have travel insurance, look up your rights there too. Can I cancel my flight if I no longer want to travel? That all depends on the type of ticket you have, the airline you\u2019re flying with and whether you have travel insurance (which is always a good idea). Insurance covers missed departures and connections \u2013 if your flight is delayed, your company may be able to help change your travel plans, though it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll refund you if your flight is not affected but you no longer want to travel. Check your airline to see if it\u2019s offering passengers the chance to cancel or change dates. As the situation spirals and airlines reroute passengers on canceled flights, the flexibility may increase. At the time of writing, American Airlines is offering free changes for those due to fly on July 19 through eight major hubs (there are caveats as to rebooking dates). British Airways said it has increased flexibility for customers flying shorthaul routes over the weekend. Delta, United and American all issued waivers for impacted customers Are hotels or rental cars affected? Marriott International says some of its hotel systems have been impacted by the ongoing global IT outage. \u201cWe are actively working with our vendors to resolve issues that have impacted certain hotel systems. We apologize for any inconvenience that guests may experience,\u201d the company said in a statement to CNN Friday afternoon. CNN has reached out to\u00a0Hilton\u00a0Hotels for information on outages. One employee at the\u00a0Hilton\u00a0Phoenix Tapatio Cliffs Resort in Phoenix, Arizona, told CNN that guests had to wait for a bellhop to open their rooms for them because an outage hit the software the hotel uses to make key cards. Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty locations are open, according to a statement from Hertz. \u201cWe are seeing an increase in volume at our call centers and sustained demand for bookings, reservation modifications and one-way rentals. Some customers might experience longer than anticipated waits, and we are working diligently to get people on the road as quickly as possible,\u201d the statement said. Are trains and other public transport systems affected? Some train systems are reporting issues related to the tech outage. In the UK, National Rail reported \u201cwidespread IT issues across the entire network\u201d on Friday. National Rail said UK train operators are unable to access driver diagrams at certain locations, so there\u2019s the potential for short-notice train cancellations. In Italy, the transport ministry said Trenitalia and Italo train networks were suspended after systems went offline. Passengers called emergency services and demanded to be let off the trains because of extreme heat, after enduring delays up to 140 minutes. Some trains on rural Italian rail lines have been stopped because of extreme heat. In the United States, trains and buses in Washington, D.C., have been impacted by Friday\u2019s outages, according to the US capital\u2019s transit authority. In New York, Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) customer information systems went temporarily offline Friday morning, according to officials. However the MTA said \u201ctrain and bus service is unaffected.\u201d Again, this isn\u2019t an exhaustive list. If you\u2019re set to travel soon, wherever you are in the world, it\u2019s worth double checking your individual journey status before you travel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/travel/global-tech-outage-what-to-know-if-youre-traveling-this-weekend/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_sport_adidas-apologizes-ad-campaign-bella-hadid-spt-intl-scli", "text": "Adidas has apologized for \u201cany upset or distress caused,\u201d after releasing an ad campaign for some retro sneakers based on a model first released during the 1972 Munich Olympics. The Munich Olympics are infamous as the event in which 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage and murdered by the Palestinian terror group known as \u201cBlack September.\u201d The controversy centered around\u00a0the German sportswear company\u2019s choice of model Bella Hadid\u00a0to front the campaign. Hadid, who was born in 1996, is Palestinian-American and has been a prominent advocate for Palestinian relief efforts. Adidas then\u00a0seemingly deleted any social media posts featuring her after criticism from Jewish groups and Israel. Adidas\u2019 decision to remove Hadid from its social media feeds was then, in turn, criticized by pro-Palestinian voices for silencing people of Palestinian heritage, and for appearing to retaliate against Hadid on the basis of her heritage. CNN cannot independently verify Adidas\u2019 posts but screenshots of them have been widely circulated, including by the state of Israel\u2019s official X account, while a picture of Hadid remains on Adidas\u2019 website promoting the sneakers. Hadid\u2019s representatives have not yet responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Hadid hasn\u2019t publicly commented about the controversy on her social media accounts, though she recently posted a photo of herself \u2013 uncaptioned \u2013 standing in front of an Adidas billboard, wearing one of the sportswear manufacturer\u2019s tops. \u201cWe are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events \u2013 though these are completely unintentional \u2013 and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\u201d a spokesperson for Adidas said in a statement sent to CNN on Friday. \u201cAs a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do,\u201d the company added. Hadid, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, has frequently spoken out about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza. In October last year, Bella Hadid wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: \u201cMy heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,\u201d referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes and military operations in Gaza \u2013 now more than 38,000 people in total, according to the enclave\u2019s Ministry of Health. \u201cI mourn for the Israeli families that have been dealing with the pain and aftermath of October 7,\u201d she added, referencing the day when Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage. For the American Jewish Committee, choosing a \u201cvocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.\u201d \u201cNeither is acceptable,\u201d it added in a post on X. The group did not provide evidence or detail for its allegation that Hadid was \u201canti-Israel.\u201d Meanwhile, Jonathan Greenblatt \u2013 the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League \u2013 wrote in his own post on the platform that Hadid\u2019s involvement in the campaign is a \u201cserious misjudgement that dishonors the victims\u201d of the 1972 terrorist attack. However, journalist Mehdi Hasan took issue with this line of criticism against Adidas and Hadid. \u201cBella Hadid has absolutely nothing in common with the 1972 terrorists \u2013 other than the fact that she is Palestinian,\u201d Hasan posted on X. \u201cBlaming people for the crimes of others who share their race or ethnicity is pure racism & bigotry,\u201d he added. When contacted by CNN to respond to this critique, an AJC spokesperson said its \u201ccriticism of Adidas making Bella Hadid one of the faces of this campaign has nothing to do with her ethnicity but her history of anti-Israel and antisemitic comments,\u201d without providing evidence for these allegations. The ADL disagreed with Hasan and reinforced its criticism of Hadid in a statement sent to CNN. The Adidas controversy comes a week before the opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/adidas-apologizes-ad-campaign-bella-hadid-spt-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Authorities are now on the hunt for a Colombian man thought to be linked to the case. Investigations have been underway since two suitcases were found on Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of the capital, on Wednesday. They contained the remains of two men, police previously said. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that officers believed the newly discovered body parts \u201care connected to the human remains found in Bristol.\u201d It added that a 36-year-old man arrested in London over the grisly find has been released without charge. They are now on the hunt for another man believed to be linked to the case. Officers said their priority is to find Yostin Andres Mosquera, a 24-year-old Colombian national, naming him for the first time. They released a photo of Mosquera clad in a black Adidas baseball cap, black jeans, a black jacket, black trainers with thick white soles, with a black backpack. Officers also believe they know the identity of the two male victims, but \u201cformal identification is yet to take place,\u201d they said. Police are trying to locate and inform their next of kin. \u201cBoth victims are thought to have been known to Mosquera and the Met is appealing for information on his whereabouts,\u201d the statement added. \u201cThis is a fast-moving enquiry with detectives in London and Bristol actively pursuing a number of lines of enquiry,\u201d Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine said. The investigation began when Avon and Somerset Police received a call late on Wednesday about a man with a suitcase \u201cacting suspiciously\u201d on the bridge in Bristol. The suitcases were later found in the area, the force said on Thursday. Authorities later said a \u201cman wanted in connection with the incident had traveled to Bristol from London earlier the same day.\u201d Police previously did not identify the individual, despite a large-scale search involving a police helicopter and coastguard. They arrested the unnamed 36-year-old early Friday but said the person was not the same individual as the one police were initially looking for. Vicks Hayward-Melen, acting Bristol commander of Avon and Somerset Police, told the BBC\u2019s Today program Friday that officers and initial attendants at the scene are being supported after the \u201creally horrendous discovery.\u201d The police have said that it is \u201cnot aware of any current risk to the wider public,\u201d adding that high-visibility patrols are being carried out in the area.

One perfect thump of his three-iron later, the South Korean made history. The four-time PGA Tour winner struck the first hole-in-one ever recorded on the 17th hole during the major at the fabled Scottish course, acing from 238 yards to light up the end of his third round. Nicknamed \u201cRabbit\u201d, the par-three has garnered a reputation for being one of the course\u2019s most menacing challenges across the 10 Opens hosted at Royal Troon since 1923. Playing as the sixth hardest hole during the second round, a sharply sloping green guarded by four deep bunkers makes leaving with par \u201cgold,\u201d according to tournament organizers. That was more than Si-woo had managed before Saturday, having double bogeyed and bogeyed the 17th hole across his opening two rounds. Imagine his shock then, when the shrieks of the crowds gathered by the green rippled back up the fairway. \u201cI went back to the bag and there were people yelling at me \u2026 I didn\u2019t realize the ball had gone in,\u201d Si-woo later told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of holes-in-one in my life \u2026 but I think this is the most memorable.\u201d It marked the longest hole-in-one in recorded history at the major (since 1980), according to golf statistician Justin Ray, bettering Frank Lickliter II\u2019s 212-yard ace at Royal Lytham and St Anne\u2019s fifth hole in 2001. \u201cThat is perfection \u2026 what a treat,\u201d three-time Open champion Nick Faldo cooed on the Sky Sports broadcast. \u201cHe\u2019ll frame the ball but he won\u2019t frame the shirt,\u201d he added. Si-woo followed up his eagle with a closing par to card an even-par 71, keeping him at five-over overall for the week. A mammoth 12 strokes behind clubhouse leader Shane Lowry before the Irishman teed off for his third round, the South Korean\u2019s hopes of a first major title this week are all but over, but his hole-in-one lifted the gloom on a frustrating week. \u201cI was not doing very well, I was feeling terrible for my shot the last couple days,\u201d the 2017 Players Championship winner said. \u201cThen finally I got the best golf shot I\u2019ve ever had this week.

{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes\u00a0between students, pro-government supporters\u00a0and armed police fueling\u00a0widespread\u00a0anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities. State broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTV) was off air on Friday after student demonstrators allegedly set fire to its headquarters, according to local media, and protesters have called for a nationwide shutdown in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Mobile and internet services have been cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Why are students protesting? Many Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government\u2019s quota system, which reserves more than half of\u00a0civil service posts for certain groups. Some 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation\u2019s history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler. Many of the country\u2019s contemporary political elite are related to that generation \u2013 including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975. The reserved roles are linked to\u00a0job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina\u2019s ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit. \u201cA government job is a really good opportunity,\u201d said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. \u201cAbout 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Driving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has \u201cwidened in urban areas.\u201d\u00a0In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education. In 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case. Critics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth. \u201cThe freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation \u2026 for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,\u201d said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. \u201cBut there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota \u2026 has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.\u201d Why did the protests escalate? The protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades. The demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League \u2013 the\u00a0student wing of the ruling Awami League party \u2013 reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus. Since then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after \u201cwidespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.\u201d The student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd. \u201cSomeone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.\u201d Another protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: \u201cThere are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah. Reports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting\u00a032 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data. Authorities have also moved to block online communications. Internet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a \u201cnear-total national internet shutdown\u201d across Bangladesh on Thursday. \u201cThe new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,\u201d it said on X. What has the government said? The demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks. Hasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court. \u201cI especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,\u201d Hasina said in a news conference Thursday. But she has been accused of enflaming\u00a0protester anger by reportedly calling them \u201crazakar,\u201d\u00a0 an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war. \u201cWe expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,\u201d said protester Salman Farsi. \u201cWhat did the students do to deserve this tag?\u201d Student protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system. \u201cThis is a people\u2019s movement against the authoritarian government,\u201d Hossain said. \u201cThis is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn\u2019t go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.\u201d What has global reaction been? Bangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere,\u00a0including in New York\u2019s Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen. The US said it was \u201ccontinuing to monitor the reports of violence from the ongoing protests in and around Dhaka,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said in a briefing on Thursday. \u201cFreedom of expression and peaceful assembly are essential building blocks to any thriving democracy, and we condemn the recent acts of violence in Bangladesh.\u201d UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0called for restraint on all sides and urged the government to investigate all acts of violence, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. \u201cThe secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh. Violence can never be the solution,\u201d Dujarric  said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/asia/bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) both said they had carried out tests and found samples of the virus in sewage water. \u201cPoliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) had been identified at six locations in sewage samples collected on 23 June from Khan Younis and Deir al Balah,\u201d WHO said Friday. WHO said the findings are linked to the \u201cdisastrous sanitation situation\u201d created by Israel\u2019s brutal military assault in Gaza since the Hamas attacks of October 7. \u201cIt is important to note the virus has been isolated from the environment only at this time; no associated paralytic cases have been detected,\u201d WHO added. It said no one has yet been treated in Gaza for paralysis or other symptoms of polio, but that residents must now \u201ccontend with the threat\u201d posed by the disease. Various United Nations agencies \u2013 including UNICEF, the children\u2019s fund, and UNRWA, the agency for Palestinian refugees \u2013 are working with local health authorities to determine how far the virus has spread. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said polio vaccination rates prior to the conflict were \u201coptimal,\u201d but that Israel\u2019s war against Hamas had created \u201cthe perfect environment for diseases like polio to spread.\u201d \u201cThe decimation of the health system, lack of security, access obstruction, constant population displacement, shortages of medical supplies, poor quality of water and weakened sanitation are increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio,\u201d Tedros warned. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza called for practices to improve hygiene and safety. \u201cDetecting the virus that causes polio in sewage portends a real health disaster and exposes thousands of residents to the risk of contracting polio,\u201d it said in a statement, demanding \u201can immediate halt to the Israeli aggression.\u201d Wild polio was eradicated from Gaza more than 25 years ago, with pre-war vaccination coverage reaching 95% in 2022, according to WHO. Poliovirus can emerge when poor vaccination\u00a0coverage allows the weakened\u00a0form of the orally administered vaccine virus\u00a0strain\u00a0to mutate into a stronger version\u00a0capable of causing paralysis, a spokesman from WHO\u2019s global Polio Eradication program said. Meanwhile, hospitals in central Gaza said more than 20 people were killed after two Israeli air strikes on houses in the Nuseirat area. A CNN stringer on the ground said the majority of the casualties were women and children.

In February,\u00a0he told the Munich Security Conference \u201cthe American security blanket has allowed\u00a0European security to atrophy,\u201d arguing that in a world where munitions manufacturing is limited, the only option for Ukraine is a negotiated settlement. Vance was echoing the GOP\u2019s presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has long criticized NATO and accused partners in the security alliance of failing to pay their fair share. The former president has also hinted at paring back military aid to Ukraine and claimed that he could have the war settled through negotiation in 24 hours if reelected. And yet the mood among European leaders arriving in the rolling\u00a0Oxfordshire countryside is one of resignation, and resolve. \u201cI think whoever wins the US race\u2026 it will be more America first,\u201d\u00a0Belgium\u2019s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told CNN.\u00a0\u201cAnd I think the only answer to that is Europe needs to stand on its own legs\u2026 what we see in the Republican convention confirms that.\u201d Finland\u2019s President Alexander Stubb, the head of one of NATO\u2019s newest members, has read Vance\u2019s book, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d describing it as \u201cvery good.\u201d On the isolationist leanings of a Trump-Vance ticket,\u00a0he is circumspect. \u201cAm I worried? No. Because the United States wants to remain a superpower,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIs there a rebalancing going on? Yes.

The EU and NATO can address all their issues without this one individual.\u201d Europe did manage a show of unity, but one that faces mounting tests,\u00a0including\u00a0the prospect of a new US administration that may pull its support for Ukraine, and an increasingly active Ukraine-skeptic in its midst.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/europe-russia-isolationist-us-unity-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_israel-invitation-to-hiroshima-japan-sparked-controversy-intl-hnk", "text": "Hiroshima, the Japanese city devastated by a US atomic bomb in 1945, is at the center of a growing controversy after local officials dismissed calls to disinvite Israel from its annual ceremony promoting world peace as war rages in Gaza. Every year on August 6, Hiroshima gathers foreign officials, along with locals, in a minute of silence at 8:15 a.m. to mark the exact moment the bomb dropped, killing tens of thousands of people and leading to the end of World War II. Some activists and atomic bomb survivors\u2019 groups say the ceremony is no place for Israel, which is pounding Gaza with strikes as it seeks to eradicate\u00a0Hamas in response to the Palestinian militant group\u2019s devastating attack on October 7 last year. They say the Hiroshima city government should exclude Israel from this year\u2019s ceremony, as it has Russia and Belarus for the past two years over Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But Hiroshima authorities say they have no intention of excluding Israel. \u201cIt is not a double standard. Our policy is to invite all countries. However, Russia and Belarus are exceptions due to the invasion of Ukraine,\u201d a Hiroshima city government spokesperson told CNN. \u201cRussia and Belarus are not invited in order to ensure the ceremony goes smoothly.\u201d Authorities in Nagasaki, the\u00a0Japanese city hit by an atomic bomb just days after Hiroshima, told CNN they haven\u2019t decided whether to invite Israel to their peace ceremony on August 9. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza may \u201cprevent the smooth execution of the ceremony,\u201d they said, stressing the move was not a gesture of protest but a practical consideration. Calls for Israel\u2019s exclusion Of the two ceremonies, Hiroshima\u2019s is the largest with representatives from\u00a0115 countries and the European Union set to attend this year. Envoys from Russia and Belarus haven\u2019t attended since Hiroshima excluded them in 2022 following Moscow\u2019s invasion of\u00a0Ukraine in February that year. Russia used Belarus as one of the launch pads for its assault and later moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons there. This year\u2019s Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony takes place against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel\u2019s bombardment has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire enclave\u2019s more than 2 million people, who now face severe shortages of food, shelter, water and medical supplies. \u201cWhy invite Israel if they are committing genocide-like crimes, just like Russia and Belarus?\u201d said Tetsuji Kumada, executive director of Hiroshima\u2019s Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organization, one of the groups opposing Israel\u2019s presence. \u201cIt is very disappointing that our request wasn\u2019t taken into account,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the organization wrote to the Hiroshima government in June to ask for Israel to be disinvited. Another group, Hiroshima-Palestine Vigil Community, launched an online petition in May, calling for Israel\u2019s representatives to be excluded, saying that \u201ccurrent global protests against Israel clearly outnumber those against Russia in both scale and frequency.\u201d The petition has since amassed more than 30,000 signatures. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations from critics as well as rights groups and experts that it has broken international humanitarian law with the breadth of its response to Hamas\u2019 attacks. It argues its war is against Hamas, not Palestinians, although anger over the extent of the destruction and civilian deaths in Gaza has swelled globally. CNN has reached out to the Israeli embassy in Japan for comment. Japan has taken a strong stance in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, pledging to stand with Kyiv, offering billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and military vehicles and equipment for mine-clearing operations. It has also imposed sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Tokyo has offered humanitarian aid to Gaza, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d for the critical situation in the strip and supports a two-state solution to the conflict. According to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, the Hiroshima government referred to the war in Gaza in its invitation to Israel, urging the country to cease its offensive. The invitation said it was \u201cdeeply regrettable that the lives and everyday existences of many people are being taken away,\u201d Kyodo reported. Palestinians not invited The bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later led to Japan\u2019s unconditional surrender and brought an end to World War II. But it also killed tens of thousands of people, both instantly and in the months and years to come due to radiation sickness. Every year, diplomats in Japan are invited to Hiroshima to join the commemoration that highlights the importance of peace and cautions against the use of nuclear weapons. But while some advocacy\u00a0groups urged Hiroshima to shun Israel, others supported its presence. \u201cAs a city of international peace, Hiroshima city needs to invite all nations, regardless of whether they are at war or not,\u201d said Kunihiko Sakuma, president of Hiroshima Hidankyo, an atomic bomb survivors\u2019 advocacy group. However,\u00a0the Permanent General Mission of Palestine in Tokyo complained on social platform X that it had not been invited to the ceremony. \u201cThis decision is a double standard,\u201d it said. Its envoy was never invited to the ceremony, the office told CNN. Hiroshima authorities said they only send invitations to countries with embassies in Japan and have never invited Palestinian representatives to the ceremony.

The Eugenic Protection Law, in place from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to forcibly sterilize people with disabilities, including those with mental disorders, hereditary diseases or physical deformities and leprosy. It also allowed forced abortions if either parent had those conditions. At least 25,000 people were sterilized\u00a0under the law, Kishida told a meeting at his official residence of about 130 survivors, many now elderly and in wheelchairs, public broadcaster NHK reported Wednesday. \u201cI decided to meet with you today in order to personally express my remorse and apology for the tremendous physical and mental suffering that many people have endured based on the former Eugenic Protection Law,\u201d Kishida said. The law was unconstitutional and had violated individuals\u2019 human rights and dignity, the prime minister said, adding he had ordered authorities to prepare a new compensation plan for survivors, without sharing the details. Plaintiffs and their supporters have argued that a previous government compensation offer of 3.2 million yen (about $20,000) each was too low.\u00a0They won a significant victory\u00a0earlier this month, when Japan\u2019s Supreme Court ordered the government to pay 16.5 million yen (about $105,000) each in damages to plaintiffs of several lawsuits and 2.2 million yen ($14,000) to their spouses. One plaintiff, Kikuo Kojima, described being taken to the hospital when he was 19, where he said he was \u201cgiven the nickname \u2018Schizophrenic\u2019 and forced into eugenic surgery.\u201d \u201cI will never forget that,\u201d he said, according to NHK. Other plaintiffs said they were bedridden for years following their operations, faced a lifetime of discrimination, were unable to work due to the physical and mental toll, and wished their bodies could return to their \u201coriginal\u201d state, NHK reported. Eugenics law Japan experienced a brief baby boom after World War II, alarming authorities as they struggled to deal with severe nationwide food shortages and a war-ravaged economy, according to academics and Japanese medical associations. The government leapt to implement population control measures, including a national campaign to promote contraception \u2013 and the Eugenic Protection Law, which \u201cmade abortions and sterilizations available,\u201d and was described as \u201cgovernment policy in the population field\u201d in a 1972 report by the government-run Institute of Population Problems. The legislation aimed to \u201cprevent the increase of the inferior descendants from the eugenic point of view and to protect the life and health of the mother,\u201d according to a copy of the law \u2013 which listed \u201cremarkable abnormal sexual desire\u201d and \u201cremarkable clinical inclination\u201d among the conditions targeted. Besides an official apology, the plaintiffs have also demanded a compensation law that would benefit all survivors, even those who haven\u2019t filed lawsuits. They also urged authorities to quickly conclude ongoing related legal cases, stressing that most plaintiffs were\u00a0reaching the end of their lives, NHK reported. \u201cI heard the apology directly from the prime minister to the victims, but I think we could have heard it earlier,\u201d said Koji Niisato, an attorney for plaintiffs, according to NHK. \u201cToday, I hope that you will listen to the actual conditions of the victims and their real voices and do your utmost to achieve a full resolution for them.\u201d Some plaintiffs also said they were not fully satisfied with the government\u2019s apology and the Supreme Court ruling. \u201cIt has been really hard for a long time, and even after hearing the verdict, I cannot put my mind at ease,\u201d one plaintiff said, according to NHK.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/asia/japan-kishida-apology-forced-sterilization-eugenics-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_style_rajesh-vora-punjab-architecture-snap", "text": "Looking down a street in Daulatpur, a rural village in Punjab, India with a mishmash of eclectic, colorful architecture, photographer Rajesh Vora felt he had struck lucky. In front of him, was a large facsimile of an Air-India plane on top of a pale green\u00a0building. Facing it from across the street, a replica of an army tank atop a yellow residence pointed its gun, the painted figure of a soldier rising from its hatch. Though the designs could have been plucked from an amusement park, they were actually elaborate rooftop water tanks of private homes. Vora\u2019s images of this phenomenon \u2014 a vernacular tradition of architectural icons that sprung up across the\u00a0across the northwestern state some five decades ago \u2014 became a multiyear project that the Mumbai-based photographer is\u00a0now exhibiting at Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles\u00a0in France this summer.\u00a0He visited 150 villages and photographed hundreds of these designs. The ostentatious d\u00e9cor is \u201ca brilliant idea combining form and function,\u201d Vora said in a phone call with CNN. The first time he noticed the water tanks while on assignment in the region in 2014, he was \u201camused, like anybody would be seeing this kind of sculpture,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut then I realized, as an architecture photographer, what amazed me was the integration of the sculptures on the houses, built by local artisans.\u201d Crowning the tops of these homes, the unusual status symbols are often commissioned by Indian emigrants\u00a0who return home during the year, or by their families who still live in the region. Some are functional water tanks while others sit on top more traditional plumbing designs. Each tell a specific story, he explained. \u201cIf somebody plays sports, they\u2019ll put up a football there, if they are a chef they will put a pressure cooker\u2026 if somebody likes a nice drink, they\u2019ll put a bottle of whiskey,\u201d he explained. Planes, tanks and cars became popular motifs, too. \u201cAll their personal aspirations are embodied in their houses.\u201d Last year, Vora published a book, \u201cEveryday Monuments\u201d that features images from some the villages he visited and brings together texts from architectural, scholarly and curatorial experts to explore the unique tradition. Through their research, they approximate that there are around 30 artisans in the region who work with homeowners and their families via word of mouth to create these lively sculptures. Diasporic icons Vora came across the buildings by chance, as he visited a gurdwara\u00a0\u2014 a Sikh temple \u2014 in the village of Talhan while working on a commissioned photo story about global migration. Known as Hawaijahaj, or \u201cAirplane,\u201d gurdwara, visitors bring offerings of model aircraft in hopes that they will be blessed with swift visa approval to leave India. He heard that many who were successful eventually returned to their villages to add planes to the exteriors of newly built homes, he explained. Over the course of six trips from 2014 to 2019, Vora began to better understand the full scope of the trend. It had begun sometime in the 1970s, as Punjabi diasporic communities flourished in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, among other countries.\u00a0As the popularity of custom-designed water tanks grew, local builders became specialized in their craft. The favored icons tend to shift in popularity over the years \u2014 when the country began manufacturing its popular Maruti van, for example, in the 1980s, it began appearing on homes, too. He also observed how architectural styles from different countries began to mix into the villages as owners brought back ideas from abroad to unique effect. But documenting the water tanks proved difficult when he first began. The remote areas of Punjab weren\u2019t yet mapped by Google, he explained, so he visited villages and hoped for the best. \u201cSome days are lucky \u2014 you might get three or four kinds of water tanks; others, you might not get anything,\u201d Vora said. Daulatpur Village, where multiple designs could be seen in one frame, was a rarity. Vora doesn\u2019t know how the tradition will grow or change as the region continues to see major shifts \u2014 especially as Indians from marginalized backgrounds gain more economic mobility and second- or third- generation immigrants amass wealth overseas. \u201cWill they come back to India? Will they build their own houses? Will they take care of these houses?\u201d We don\u2019t know,\u201d Vora said of younger generations. \u201cThese houses are perishable if you don\u2019t maintain them after 30 or 40 years\u2026 maybe they will disappear.\u201d The photographer hopes to continue to create an archive of Punjab\u2019s distinctive architectural legacy \u2014 and he\u2019ll keep looking out for a home that bears the icon of what he would choose if he were commissioning a design. \u201cIt would have to be a camera,\u201d he said with a laugh. After traveling more than 3,500 miles, he has yet to spot one.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/style/rajesh-vora-punjab-architecture-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

The arrests all took place between July 4 and 14 and most were in the state of T\u00e1chira, according to the report.

Critics of President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government have long\u00a0accused it\u00a0of rigging votes and silencing the opposition, with the 2018 election that returned Maduro to office described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States. This time around, two opposition candidates \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 have been barred from running despite Maduro\u2019s pledge to the United States that he would hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief. Two days after Laboratorio\u2019s report came out, Machado said in a post on X that her security chief had been arrested on Wednesday. Machado said her security chief Milciades \u00c1vila was \u201ckidnapped by the Maduro regime and accused of gender violence against some women.\u201d The opposition leader said the women who accuse \u00c1vila of gender violence tried to \u201cattack\u201d her and opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia in a restaurant last Saturday. \u201cThere are dozens of witnesses and videos that demonstrate that this was a planned provocation to leave us without protection 11 days before July 28,\u201d Machado wrote.

The election is scheduled to take place on July 28. Ten candidates are in the running, including the incumbent Maduro, who aspires to re-election for six more years after 11 years in power. Maduro\u2019s main opponent is Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, who represents an alliance bringing together the main opposition parties and leaders in Venezuela. The legal adviser to the opposition campaign, Perkins Rocha, said Sunday that at least 11 people linked to the campaign command had been arrested over the weekend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/americas/arbitrary-detentions-venezuela-election-ngo-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

In an earlier pitch to the European parliament in Strasbourg, France, von der Leyen on Thursday pledged to invest in infrastructure and industry, create a new \u201cEuropean Defense Union\u201d and stay the course on the continent\u2019s green transition. After a secret ballot, von der Leyen was reelected with 401 votes in favor and 284 against. She needed more than 360 ballots to secure a majority in the 720-seat parliament. Von der Leyen, who led the commission through the Covid-19 pandemic and the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, will now preside over a bloc that shifted rightward after last month\u2019s European elections, when far-right parties won a record number of seats. Addressing the parliament before the lunchtime vote, von der Leyen said the next five years of her term \u201cwill define Europe\u2019s place in the world for the next five decades. It will decide whether we shape our own future or let it be shaped by events or by others.\u201d Von der Leyen, a 65-year-old German national, was parachuted into the presidential candidacy process as a compromise candidate in 2019, but has since become one of Europe\u2019s most solid pillars. Several of the continent\u2019s other leaders \u2013 from Germany\u2019s former Chancellor Angela Merkel to French President Emmanuel Macron \u2013 have retired or been weakened by domestic politics. Von der Leyen\u2019s own position was somewhat diminished by last month\u2019s election, which saw a surge in support for the far right and saw Brussels\u2019 center ground shrink. Her reelection was not certain but widely expected, after she was proposed by EU leaders and could rely on the support of her center-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP), as well as the center-left Socialist and Democrats (S&D) and liberal Renew blocs. Shortly before Thursday\u2019s vote, the Green bloc also announced it would support her. After the vote, von der Leyen said her reelection was \u201ca very emotional and special moment\u201d and that she was grateful for the trust the parliament had placed in her. \u201cWe have spared no effort. We have navigated the most troubled waters that our union has ever faced. And we have kept the course on our long-term European goals,\u201d she said, praising the work done under her first term. Earlier Thursday, von der Leyen published a 31-page policy proposal, setting out her priorities if she won a second term. Echoing remarks she made after last month\u2019s vote, she stressed \u201cit is essential that the democratic center in Europe holds\u201d in the face of resurgent extremes, calling on mainstream parties to \u201clive up to the scale of the concerns and the challenges that people face in their lives.\u201d Von der Leyen pledged to \u201cturbo charge investment\u201d needed by cash-strapped EU governments for their \u201cgreen, digital and social transition.\u201d She also vowed to create a European Defense Union and appoint a commissioner for defense, a new role for the bloc that was forged in peacetime but has since had to respond to Russia\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine, and the prospect of a Donald Trump-led United States retreating from the world stage. Under the proposed new defense union, member states will retain responsibility for their own troops, but will work more closely with others to \u201ccoordinate efforts to strengthen the defense industrial base.\u201d She also proposed a Europe-wide air defense system and cyber protection measures. Speaking in Strasbourg before her reelection, von der Leyen said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s recent trip to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201can appeasement mission,\u201d and pledged to maintain EU support for Ukraine. Von der Leyen\u2019s reelection comes a day after the EU\u2019s second-highest court delivered an unusual rebuke to the commission, ruling it was not transparent enough about the contracts it signed for Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/eu-parliament-von-der-leyen-second-term-commission-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

The eight-time PGA Tour winner navigated a testing Royal Troon in two-under 69 to edge clear by a stroke but will have to hold off a chasing group of six players in his rearview mirror to clinch his first major title. A closing bogey put a dampener on what had been another strong showing from Horschel, who tore out of the blocks with four birdies across his first nine holes. The 37-year-old has often struggled at the Open \u2013 missing the cut in six of his previous nine outings \u2013 but continues to impress amid brutal wet and windy conditions that sent half of the world\u2019s top-10 ranked players tumbling towards an early exit. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be here my entire life. I\u2019m finally here. I\u2019m embracing it,\u201d Horschel, whose career best major performance was a tied-fourth finish at the 2013 US Open, told reporters. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve done this year \u2026 is manifest seeing myself holding the trophy before I go to sleep every night, envisioning myself holding that trophy on 18, walking out to the crowd and being congratulated as Open champion. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do again tonight, and hopefully that comes true tomorrow. If it doesn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll get back on the grind and work harder to get back in a position like this again.\u201d A bunched chasing pack sets the stage for a grandstand finish, with South Africa\u2019s Thriston Lawrence, American trio Sam Burns, Russell Henley and Xander Schauffele, as well as English pair Justin Rose and Daniel Brown just one stroke behind Horschel\u2019s four-under par benchmark. World No. 272 Brown had looked on course to take a shock lead into Sunday after birdieing the 16th hole, only to finish with a bogey and a double bogey that resigned him to a two-over 73. Regardless, the 29-year-old \u2013 who had to go through final qualifying just to stamp a last-minute ticket to his major debut this week \u2013 sits within striking distance of what would be a truly stunning sporting upset. \u201cI suppose a lot of people probably thought I was going to be shaking this morning and really nervous, but I\u2019ve been absolutely fine,\u201d Brown, who clinched his first victory on the European Tour last year, told reporters. \u201cAfter the last two holes it\u2019s a little bit of a kick in the teeth, I suppose, but if you\u2019d have told me I was going to go into the final round of the Open one or two shots back, I would have ripped your hand off.\u201d \u2018Coffin\u2019 puts Lowry\u2019s hopes in grave danger Brown\u2019s playing partner Lowry had carried a two stroke advantage over the Englishman into the weekend and started confidently, but was sent into a tailspin after the pair both found the infamous \u201ccoffin\u201d bunker from the eighth tee. While Brown managed to exit the sand relatively smoothly to leave the \u201cPostage Stamp\u201d hole with bogey, his Irish counterpart put himself in even greater trouble when he pulled his escape effort into the thick rough beyond the green. The 2019 champion had rebounded superbly from a double bogey at 11th hole during the second round, but could not channel the same response on Saturday, signing off with his fifth bogey of the back nine for a 77. Having taken a three shot advantage to the eighth tee, the 37-year-old will start the final round three strokes adrift of leader Horschel, and one back from world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who shot even-par 71 to stay in contention for a second major title of the season. \u201cThis game is just hard, and now you feel how hard it was for playing well the first two days in those conditions. Honestly, it was brutal,\u201d Lowry told reporters. \u201cThe 8th hole was killer really, make par there, and you can still shoot three or four-over from there and still be leading the tournament. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to say. It was a grind. It wasn\u2019t much fun.\u201d Lowry will tee off alongside Australian Adam Scott at 1:45 pm local time (8:45 am EDT) Sunday, with leader Horschel and Lawrence the last group out at 2:25 pm (9:25 pm EDT).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/sport/billy-horschel-open-championship-third-round-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

The internet has chosen its new favorite national uniform at the forthcoming Paris 2024 Olympics: Mongolia\u2019s. Featuring intricately embroidered vests, pleated robes and accessories inspired by traditional attire, the country\u2019s opening and closing ceremony outfits have taken social media by storm since being unveiled last week. The designs are the work of Michel&Amazonka, an Ulaanbaatar-based label producing couture and ready-to-wear garments that \u201cexpress the essence of Mongolian tradition and culture\u201d in what the brand calls a \u201ccontemporary light.\u201d The label revealed its designs via a series of glossy photos and a video shoot reminiscent of a luxury fashion campaign.\u00a0Female athletes\u2019 outfits come with\u00a0ceremonial earrings and embroidered bags, while male flag-bearers will wear an archery hat, belt and traditional Mongolian boots. Designs incorporate the national colors of blue, red, and white, as well as various traditional patterns and motifs, including the \u201cSoyombo\u201d symbol that appears in the country\u2019s flag. Motifs associated with Paris and the Games, namely the Eiffel Tower and the Olympic flame also feature. The outfits took an average of 20 hours each to craft, according to the Mongolian National Olympic Committee. The uniforms have attracted attention on\u00a0social media \u2014\u00a0especially TikTok, where fashion and sport commentators applauded the designs. \u201cThey just won the Olympics before it even started,\u201d said style writer Ryan Yip in a video viewed over 2 million times. In another TikTok video, viewed almost 300,000 times, Australian user Bee Jamieson said: \u201cThe detailing is really beautiful\u2026 it looks like everything\u2019s been really well thought out.\u201d Popular sports creator geoff0w_ meanwhile said: \u201cThese go ridiculously hard.\u201d On the\u00a0brand\u2019s\u00a0Instagram page, users heaped further praise on the outfits. \u201cThe most beautiful uniform so far,\u201d read one comment. \u201cSuch intricate, and beautiful designs!\u201d wrote another user.

Mongolia has participated in all but one summer Olympics since 1964. The landlocked nation won its first \u2014 and, to date, only \u2014 gold medals (in judo and boxing) at the Beijing 2008 games. This year, the country is sending more than 30 athletes to the Paris Olympics, which kick off on July 26. Mongolian athletes will compete in nine different sports, including cycling, shooting and wrestling. Elsewhere at the Games, Berluti have designed France\u2019s opening and closing ceremony unforms and Ralph Lauren will again dress Team USA, having done so at every Olympics since 2008.

{"id": "2024_07_16_europe_trump-vp-jd-vance-europe-ukraine-intl", "text": "Many of America\u2019s closest allies were already dreading the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Now that the former president has picked JD Vance as his running mate, they potentially have a lot more to worry about. By choosing Vance, Trump has sent a clear signal that, if elected, his America-first foreign policy will be back in force. Vance, a junior senator for Ohio, is a staunch critic of sending support to Ukraine as it tries to defend itself against Russia. Like Trump, he has repeatedly criticized NATO and its European members for not spending enough on defense. And he has made a number of comments that have raised eyebrows across the pond \u2013 including when he said the United Kingdom would become the \u201cfirst truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon\u201d under the new Labour government. His nomination puts an end to the hopes by some of America\u2019s allies that Trump might soften his foreign policy stance if reelected. That hope was fueled by Trump himself. While he has often repeated his claim that he \u201cwould end the war\u201d in Ukraine in one day if reelected and said he would not send any more money to Kyiv, he stopped short of getting his allies in Congress to block the $61 billion aid package approved earlier this year. \u201cHe could have told members (of the Congress) not to vote for it and instead he tacitly allowed it\u00a0to go through,\u201d said Kristine Berzina, a geopolitics and security expert who leads the German Marshall Fund of the United States\u2019 Geostrategy North program. \u201cSo there was a sense in Washington that Trump has been in a fairly pro-Ukrainian moment, and that he should have the benefit of the doubt \u2013 perhaps his views on Europe and Ukraine have evolved, especially given the much higher defense spending in Europe now,\u201d she\u00a0told CNN in an interview. But with the selection of his running mate, Trump dashed these hopes. \u201cJD Vance does not appear to be interested in being a good ally to Europe,\u201d Berzina said. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance suggested Ukraine should negotiate with Russia because the US and other allies do not have the capacity to support it. Ukraine and NATO have dismissed that scenario, because it would most likely mean Kyiv would have to give up some of its pre-war territory. \u201cI think what\u2019s reasonable to accomplish is some negotiated peace. I think Russia has incentive to come to the table right now. I think Ukraine, Europe and the United States have incentives to come to the table,\u201d he said at the conference, adding that the fact that Putin \u201cis a bad guy does not mean we can\u2019t engage in basic diplomacy.\u201d On Wednesday, Russia welcomed Vance\u2019s stance on Ukraine. \u201cHe (Vance) stands for peace, for cessation of aid. We can only welcome this because, in fact, it is necessary to stop pumping Ukraine with weapons, and the war will end,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a press conference at the United Nations. Lavrov added that Russia \u201cwill be ready to work with any American leader elected by the American people\u201d as long as this leader \u201cis ready for an equitable, mutually respectful dialogue.\u201d In Munich, Vance notably skipped a key meeting between a bipartisan delegation of US senators and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d learn anything new there. He did attend a meeting with Zelensky in Washington in December but left early. Asked by CNN\u2019s Kaitlin Collins about Vance\u2019s assertion that the outcome of the war would not change even if Ukraine received US funding, Zelensky said Vance did \u201cnot understand what is going on here.\u201d \u201cTo understand it is to come to the frontline to see what\u2019s going on\u2026 without this support. And he will understand that millions of people will be killed,\u201d he added. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand it, of course, God bless you don\u2019t have the war on your territory.\u201d Pivot to China Vance has argued that the US should turn its focus away from Russia and toward\u00a0East Asia. Earlier this week, he said the war in Ukraine must be brought to a \u201crapid close\u201d so that America could focus on \u201cthe real issue, which is China.\u201d That\u2019s the \u201cbiggest threat to our country and we\u2019re completely distracted from it,\u201d Vance said in an interview with Fox News Monday. In an op-ed published in the New York Times in April, Vance also argued that US efforts to supply Ukraine with air defense systems could be detrimental to Taiwan\u2019s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing. \u201cThese weapons are not only needed by Ukraine. If China were to set its sights on Taiwan, the Patriot missile system would be critical to its defense,\u201d he wrote. The idea that East Asia, and China specifically, poses as big, if not a bigger, threat to the US than Russia is not unique to Vance. Trevor McCrisken, an US foreign policy expert and associate professor at the University of Warwick, said there is bipartisan agreement between Democrats and Republicans that China is the biggest threat internationally to US interests. \u201cBoth parties say you\u2019ve got to be strong, and you\u2019ve got to prevent China from fulfilling whatever ambitions it might have, economically, militarily, and so on. It\u2019s just that most Democrats and the more moderate Republicans believe that Russia is also a threat,\u201d he told CNN in an interview. In the eyes of most Western leaders, the threats from China and Russia go hand in hand. Just last week, NATO leaders called China a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine in the alliance\u2019s most forceful statement on Beijing\u2019s involvement in the conflict. \u201cTo have a rather simplistic view that if you back away from Ukraine that\u2019s going to help you with China, it might not be the case,\u201d McCrisken said, adding that Vance is likely trying to use his more anti-European stance for political reasons too. \u201cIt is a way of painting Europe as not standing up for itself when it should. Historically, the US has had to go in and bail out Europe so many times.\u201d Sam Greene, the director of the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) and a professor of Russian politics at King\u2019s College London, said Vance\u2019s nomination should make it clear to America\u2019s allies that the shift toward the Trumpian kind of Republican foreign policy is likely more long-term. \u201cThe last time we had a Trump presidency, I think Europeans looked at this as potentially a four-year blip, and then breathed a sigh of relief when Biden was elected and thought that we\u2019d return to normal \u2026 and I think that there was some wishful thinking in that, and people have now begun to recognize that,\u201d he said. The effect of this shift, Greene said, is apparent even now \u2013 despite the White House being in Democratic hands. US President Joe Biden had an extremely hard time getting the latest Ukraine aid package through Congress, forcing Ukraine\u2019s European allies to start thinking about a plan B. The initial delay in Congress approving the package resulted in a Czech-led initiative to find and fund alternative sources of ammunition for Kyiv, among other efforts to look for assistance elsewhere. \u201cThe unreliability of American leadership in Europe has been a fact that Europeans have now had some time to get used to. Even if Biden is reelected, America will be difficult to rely on,\u201d Greene said. If Trump chose someone with a more traditional foreign policy stance to be a running mate \u2013 for example the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, America\u2019s allies could have hoped that post-Trump, the Republican party might pivot back to what Greene called \u201ctrans-Atlantic solidarity.\u201d \u201cBut if in fact, not only are we looking at another Trump administration, but we\u2019re looking at a future of the Republican Party that is dominated by people like JD Vance, then that is a much more sobering prospect for Europe,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/europe/trump-vp-jd-vance-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Archaeologists in the square outside the Archbasilica of St John Lateran in the city center unearthed a complex architectural structure including walls believed to have protected the Patriarchio, a monumental basilica envisaged by Emperor Constantine in the 4th century, the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily important find for the city of Rome and its medieval history, as no extensive archaeological excavations have ever been carried out in the square in modern times,\u201d the ministry said. The initial structure of the building, which follows Constantine\u2019s declaration of tolerance for Christianity in the Roman Empire in 313, was expanded in stages between the 9th and 13th centuries and housed the papacy until 1305 when it temporarily moved to Avignon in France, the ministry added. The area around St John Lateran is being spruced up ahead of the Jubilee, a year-long event starting in December that is expected to attract more than 30 million pilgrims and tourists to the Italian capital. During a Jubilee, Catholics can obtain special indulgences, or remission of their sins, if they fulfill certain conditions and do good works or make pilgrimages. Rome\u2019s long history, stretching back almost 2,800 years, means that roadworks often lead to archaeological discoveries.

{"id": "2024_07_18_china_trump-vance-china-taiwan-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "The official launch of the Republican presidential campaign ticket of Donald Trump and JD Vance this week has been closely scrutinized by governments around the globe looking for clues to what a return of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy might look like \u2013 including in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Vance, a junior senator from Ohio, wove several mentions of China\u00a0\u2013 and what he painted as its negative impact on the American economy \u2013 into his introduction of his own life and views to the Republican National Convention (RNC) Wednesday, when he accepted the nomination to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential candidate. Much like his running mate, Vance claimed that policies in past decades supported by President Joe Biden and \u201cout-of-touch politicians\u201d\u00a0in Washington meant the US \u201cwas flooded with cheap Chinese goods, with cheap foreign labor, and in the decades to come, deadly Chinese fentanyl.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to build factories again \u2026 together, we will protect the wages of American workers and stop the Chinese Communist Party from building their middle class on the backs of American citizens,\u201d Vance said. The comments,\u00a0which were among the few direct references to foreign nations throughout the nearly 40-minute speech, come in a week where Vance and Trump have shown signals\u00a0of how their administration would shape US policy and relations with China \u2013 and US partners in Asia. That\u2019s drawn attention from the region, where countries\u2019 ties with the US start to look different if power changes hands in the November elections. Beijing has already obliquely called for the rhetoric to tone down, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson on both Tuesday and Wednesday repeating that Beijing is \u201copposed to making China an issue in US elections,\u201d when asked about statements from each Trump and Vance in recent days. \u2018Biggest threat\u2019 Vance has already rattled allies in Europe by strongly criticizing US support for Ukraine as it tries to defend itself against Russia. Like Trump, he has also repeatedly criticized NATO and its European members for not spending enough on defense. That view drew praise from Russia\u2019s top diplomat on Wednesday. \u201cHe (Vance) stands for peace, for cessation of aid. We can only welcome this because, in fact, it is necessary to stop pumping Ukraine with weapons, and the war will end,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. Part of Vance\u2019s skepticism toward support for Ukraine lies in his view that a much more pressing danger to the US is being ignored. Vance was swift to name China the \u201cbiggest threat to our country,\u201d in an interview with Fox News Monday as the RNC got underway. The war in Ukraine must be brought to a \u201crapid close\u201d so America can focus on \u201cthe real issue, which is China,\u201d he said. The vice-presidential candidate has in recent months also argued that the US supplying Ukraine with air defense systems could hurt its ability to aid Taiwan\u2019s defense \u2013 if China were to attack the self-ruled island. Vance doesn\u2019t have the long-standing China-hawk credentials of other potential running mates Trump reportedly considered, such as Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and vice presidents can have a varied level of involvement in foreign affairs. But Trump\u2019s selection of the 39-year-old senator is seen by some observers to reinforce a hard line on China \u2013 a position Beijing is likely watching closely. The former president reshaped American policy toward Beijing during his four years in office \u2013 even as he has professed to \u201crespect\u201d and \u201clike\u201d autocratic Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u2013 launching a tech and trade war and casting\u00a0China as a rival whose success comes at the US\u2019s expense. US President Joe Biden has largely kept \u2013 and more recently expanded \u2013 tariffs Trump placed on a wide swath of Chinese goods. He\u2019s made countering what Washington says is a\u00a0security threat from China a cornerstone of his foreign policy, even as he\u2019s worked to stabilize communications with Beijing. All that considered, \u201cthe Chinese administration is (likely) scenario and contingency planning with alarm for the prospective return of an administration that is even less keen on cooperation and engagement than the current Democrat administration,\u201d Brian Wong, a fellow at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Centre on Contemporary China and the World. View on Taiwan Another issue that Beijing is watching closely is how these candidates frame their stance on Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims as its own, despite never having controlled it. In an interview this week with Bloomberg Businessweek, Trump said Taiwan \u201cshould pay us for defense,\u201d according to a transcript released by the media outlet Tuesday. The former president also suggested that the US would struggle to defend the island because of distance, saying \u201cTaiwan is 9,500 miles away. It\u2019s 68 miles away from China.\u201d The US maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan, under which it provides the island with the means for its defense. Taipei has for decades purchased weapons from Washington and only last year for the first time received US aid for arms support. While there may be a wide latitude between campaign rhetoric and policy once an administration is in office, Trump\u2019s comments cut a sharp contrast to those of Biden, who has been a staunch advocate of support for Taiwan and maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. They\u2019ve also caught the notice of Beijing and Taipei. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, which has long slammed US arms transfers to Taiwan, on Wednesday said, \u201cthe Taiwan question is purely China\u2019s internal affair and brooks no external interference.\u201d And in Taipei, Premier Cho Jung-tai insisted that Taiwan is willing to take more responsibility for its defense and maintaining peace. \u201cWe are willing to do more in our shared responsibilities towards the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region. This is for our own defense and to ensure our own security,\u201d Cho said. But observers are skeptical of whether such a tone from Trump would be reflected in his administration, especially one likely to be stacked with more hawkish figures. Trump is unlikely to be \u201cin a position to change the fundamentals of US policy on Taiwan, or ignore Taiwan\u2019s security,\u201d said Yun Sun, director of the China program at Washington-based think tank the Stimson Center. Beijing, however, may see a boon in Trump\u2019s use of similarly skeptical rhetoric toward other governments in the region such as Japan and South Korea. While Biden has tightened ties with these American allies amid security concerns about China, Trump has taken a much more transactional view of Washington\u2019s historical defense alliances and reportedly demanded as president that the two countries pay more for US troops stationed on their territory. Vance, speaking generally of US \u201callies\u201d on Wednesday, also nodded to such rhetoric warning of \u201cno more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer.\u201d Tough trade talk If elected again, Trump has also threatened to inflame economic frictions between Beijing and Washington \u2013 at one point floating upwards of 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports to the US \u2013 levels economists say would amount to a de facto decoupling of the world\u2019s two largest economies. In the Bloomberg Businessweek interview, Trump denied 60% tariffs but suggested he could raise tariffs to around 50% and that this would encourage American companies to manufacture in the US and not China. \u201cEconomically, they\u2019re phenomenal,\u201d he said. The comments come with trade tensions between the US and China on the rise again, and Beijing looking to challenge US industrial policy on electric vehicles at the World Trade Organization \u2013\u00a0a move that followed Biden\u2019s decision in May to raise levies on Chinese products including electric vehicles and their batteries. And Beijing \u2013 which is grappling with its own economic woes \u2013 may be preparing for more friction if Trump takes office. \u201cChina is watching the election very closely,\u201d said Sun in Washington. The substance of Biden\u2019s China policy \u2013 in terms of sanctions, tariffs and competition \u2013 has not been that different from Trump\u2019s, she noted, and Biden has been keener on strengthening alliances and coalitions to counter China together. \u201cBut the style of Biden\u2019s China policy is more predictable and stabilizing. Since neither is China-friendly, Beijing at least prefers the predictability and stability of Biden.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/china/trump-vance-china-taiwan-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_style_dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon", "text": "Pristine, crisp and all-white \u2014 tennis whites have been a tradition dating back centuries. The distinctive look has not only made the racquet sport stand out, it has also become a sartorial mainstay off the courts, too. And even though most of the major tournaments have done away with the hueless uniformity, Wimbledon, the very first of them, has remained strict in its policy (as have many private clubs around the world). The prestigious championship even clamped down on the rule a decade ago, prohibiting colorful accents that had become increasingly common \u2014\u00a0 the year after Roger Federer\u2019s now-infamous pair of orange-soled sneakers were banned after his first round in 2013. The rules once called for \u201cpredominantly white\u201d outfits, allowing some competitors to play with color combinations, such as Serena Williams\u2019 tribute to Wimbledon treat strawberries and cream in 2010. But the crackdown changed the wording to \u201calmost entirely white,\u201d per the organizers: no off-white, no panels of color, no varying colorways on sneakers. The only recent loosening of rules was in 2023, to allow women to wear dark-colored shorts on the court following criticisms that the rules weren\u2019t accommodating for menstruation leaks. But why did tennis whites become the standard? The reasons often cited are practical ones, from heat reflection to sweat-masking. But senior curator Kevin Jones of the ASU Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (ASU FIDM) Museum in Los Angeles, who organized the recent traveling exhibition \u201cSporting Fashion: Outdoor Girls 1800 - 1960,\u201d said it really comes down to a long history of clubs enforcing social status, starting when lawn tennis skyrocketed in popularity in Victorian-era England as a leisure sport \u2014 and a rare one that allowed women, too. \u201cIt\u2019s completely elitist because white clothes are difficult to maintain,\u201d he said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cAnd the types of materials that these dresses were made of, which were cottons and linens, creased easily, so to keep them nice and freshly starched was also an aspect of that care.\u201d Challenging the rules Of course, tennis style has drastically changed in a century-and-a-half since it first became a recreational sensation for the upper class, hot off the heels of croquet (and utilizing the same neatly trimmed lawns). Early tennis attire was more akin to 19th-century leisurewear: women wore striped and patterned garments with long skirts, corseting and wide-brimmed hats; men donned wool pants, button-downs or sweaters. Because spectators and players have often adhered to similar styles, fashion and tennis have had a \u201cmutual exchange over time, where various tennis trends have seeped into wider culture as well,\u201d said sports journalist Ben Rothenberg, author of \u201cTennis: The Stylish Life\u201d as well as a recent biography on Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s been more than apparent in the past few months as Zendaya turned out a series of tennis-inspired high-fashion red-carpet looks matching the on- and off-court drama of the film \u201cChallengers,\u201d and recently faced Federer in an \u201cair tennis\u201d match for a campaign by the sportswear brand On. The close alignment with fashion has also led to the success of classic tennis-born labels such as Lacoste and Fred Perry, as well as radical new fashion innovations introduced on the court, like Elsa Schiaparelli dressing Spanish player Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez in culottes, a split skirt, for Wimbledon in 1931, to onlookers\u2019 shock. Like with De \u00c1lvarez, dress codes in tennis have often changed after an initial scandal. The French player Suzanne Lenglen was one of the earliest and most memorable cases, when she did away with layered, long dresses and wore a more airy calf-length skirt and shorter sleeves at Wimbledon in 1919. A muse to the designer Jean Patou, Lenglen became tennis\u2019 first fashion icon with her signature headscarf and then-provocative shorter hems. At the US, French and Australian Open, players have challenged definitions of what tennis clothes can be thanks to looser rules (subject to referee opinion). None have done so more than the Williams sisters, with Serena wearing a denim mini, tutus and cape-like silhouettes and Venus\u2019s lacy black-and-red ensemble that drew comparisons to lingerie. More recently, Serena Williams\u2019 Nike kit became the topic of conversation at the 2018 French Open when she opted for a black compression catsuit that didn\u2019t feature the compulsory tennis skirt. Though she cited its circulation benefits following a severe blood-clot scare with the birth of her child, the French Open said it would bar the style in the future. However, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association formally allowed it, and Williams continued to wear versions of the bodysuit at the 2019 and 2021 Australian Opens, normalizing the agile and simplified cut for the tennis court. \u201cI love wearing skirts,\u201d she told CNN in April while reflecting on the controversy. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure that my blood was always circulating and I had been in a near-death experience.\u201d \u201cSo I think there should have been\u2026 understanding around that whole outfit,\u201d she added. Brand distinctions Most of the Grand Slam tournaments dropped the all-white rules decades ago, likely in a bid to attract more television viewers and advertisers in an age of increased visibility for the sport. \u201cColor is vital to draw the eye and especially for those sports companies to be able to advertise their logos and their colors,\u201d Jones explained. Sports and luxury brands advertise through fashion in multiple ways, from dressing star players in custom statement pieces to promoting merchandised designs on competitors. Wimbledon\u2019s restrictive rules have been \u201cfrustrating\u201d for brands trying to sell their tournament collections, Rothenberg said. When Fila introduced Bjorn Borg throwback shirts in 2001, replicating what the tennis star wore during his five-time-winning Wimbledon streak from 1976 to 1980, Wimbledon officials said they no longer adhered to the rules. The decision sent the sports brand \u201cscrambling\u201d to get new shirts to the players wearing them, Rothenberg explained. And, after Federer\u2019s orange-soled shoes were banned, Nike had to act fast to spin their brief appearance, advertising them as \u201cOne Match Wonders\u201d in a print ad. For players, the smallest infractions have proved controversial, and some players have outright refused to play along, as Andre Agassi did from 1988-90 when he boycotted Wimbledon entirely. In 2017, Jurij Rodionov was told to change blue underwear that was peeking out of his shirts, while Sabine Lisicki recently said that she and women were often required to switch out their skin-colored bras. But Rothenberg doesn\u2019t see more leniency happening anytime soon from Wimbledon\u2019s decision-makers. \u201cI think Wimbledon sees its anachronisms as a big part of its brand and its value,\u201d he explained. \u201cWimbledon has clung on to it as a way to be distinct and different \u2014 and I think it\u2019s largely been successful. It doesn\u2019t look like any other tournament.\u201d There have been criticisms levied against the major tournaments whenever women players seem to be disproportionately affected by their dress codes, and though Rothenberg agrees, he also points out that women\u2019s styles have been more creative. Men\u2019s tenniswear has deviated less from shorts and lightwear polos or shortsleeve athletic shirts since they were introduced. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of men\u2019s short length getting markedly shorter over the last 12 months though, especially players who really have hiked up their shorts a lot,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe someday there will be rules against that if they start showing too much cheek.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled a source\u2019s surname and misstated the current name of the ASU FIDM Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_rwanda-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Rwandans lined up on Monday to elect their next president, with early results putting incumbent Paul Kagame in the lead in a vote widely expected\u00a0to give him a fourth term and extend his near quarter century in charge of the East African country. The two men standing against him \u2013 Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana \u2013 said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame\u2019s overwhelming victory was all but certain. Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end\u00a0the 1994 genocide in\u00a0Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy. Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening. Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed. Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stability candidate. His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of\u00a0supporting rebels\u00a0in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 a charge he has also denied. Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling center in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent. \u201cWe voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,\u201d Pheneas said. \u201cI voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.\u201d Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen. \u201cI voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,\u201d Vedaste said. The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame\u2019s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents. Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress. \u201cWe toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,\u201d Habineza said after voting. \u201cWe have to maintain this momentum and not regress,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are confident, each of us is confident, it\u2019s half and half,\u201d independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote. The US State Department says on its website\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0has made \u201cprogress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation.\u201d It also says it backs\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0efforts to \u201cincrease democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/rwanda-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_middleeast_israel-west-bank-jerusalem-occupation-icj-opinion-intl", "text": "The United Nations\u2019 top court said Friday that Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an unprecedented opinion that called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation of territories claimed by Palestinians for a future state. The advisory opinion, while non-binding, was the first time the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has expressed its view on the legality of Israel\u2019s presence in territories it captured in the 1967 war. An advisory opinion is not legally binding but carries moral authority and can shape international law,\u00a0according to the ICJ. Friday\u2019s opinion prompted condemnation from Israeli leaders and praise from Palestinian officials. In its sweeping judgment, the ICJ ran through a list of Israeli practices that it said violated international law, including confiscating land, building Israeli settlements in the territories, and depriving Palestinians of natural resources and the right to self-determination. The court called on Israel to\u00a0cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused. \u201cThe sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying Power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel\u2019s presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful,\u201d the opinion read. Judge Nawaf Salam, the president of the ICJ, which is based in The Hague in the Netherlands, said the court observed that \u201clarge-scale confiscation of land and the degradation of access to natural resources divests the local population of their basic means of subsistence thus inducing their departure.\u201d The court also found that Israel\u2019s declaration of Jerusalem as its capital helped to \u201centrench Israel\u2019s control of the occupied Palestinian territory\u201d and said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are \u201cin violation of international law.\u201d During the 1967 war, Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights from neighboring Arab states. Soon after, it began establishing Jewish settlements in those territories. The Palestinians want the West Bank and Gaza for a future state, with East Jerusalem at its capital. Israel considers the entirety of Jerusalem as its \u201ceternal capital.\u201d In its opinion, the court concluded that all states and international organizations, including the United Nations, are under an obligation \u201cnot to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\u201d The case predates the current Israel-Hamas war, and stems from a 2022 request for an advisory opinion by the UN General Assembly. The 15 judges on the court were asked to consider \u201cthe legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\u201d It is also separate from the ICJ proceedings held in January over an accusation from South Africa that Israel was committing genocide in its war against Hamas following the October 7 attacks \u2013 a claim Israel has vehemently denied. \u2018False decision\u2019 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians rejected the ICJ opinion. \u201cThe Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cNo false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth, just as the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\u201d Foreign Minister Israel Katz also condemned the opinion, calling it \u201cfundamentally warped, one-sided, and wrong.\u201d Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, himself a settler, also spoke out against the court.\u00a0\u201cThe answer to The Hague \u2013 sovereignty now,\u201d Smotrich\u00a0said on X, a call for Israel to annex the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority (PA) welcomed the opinion, calling it \u201ca watershed moment for Palestine, for justice, and for international law.\u201d The opinion \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more timely or sorely needed,\u201d the PA said in a statement, adding that it \u201cis a vindication of their steadfastness and perseverance.\u201d The PA also urged all states and the UN not to recognize the legality of the settlements and to \u201cdo nothing to assist Israel in maintaining this illegal situation.\u201d Implications of the ICJ opinion While the ICJ has previously given advisory opinions about Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank, Friday\u2019s announcement is a step further, some experts said. The ICJ in 2004 delivered an advisory opinion on the Israeli separation barrier around the majority of the West Bank, urging Israel to remove it from occupied land. The nonbinding opinion had found that Israel was obligated to return confiscated land or make reparations for any destruction or damage to homes, businesses and farms caused by the barrier\u2019s construction. \u201cIf the 2004 opinion held that Israel had to dismantle the wall, or at least the parts of it that encroach onto the West Bank, (Friday\u2019s opinion) holds that Israel has to withdraw as rapidly as possible from the occupied territories,\u201d Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s a major difference \u2013 not the legality of the settlements per se, but the implications of the settlements and the entire practice around them,\u201d Lieblich said. While ICJ opinions are not binding, they are perceived as \u201cvery authoritative statements of international law as is,\u201d he said, adding that they may have an impact on international organizations taking this opinion to domestic courts, demanding for example that individual counties refrain from exporting weapons that may be used in the occupied territories.

{"id": "2024_07_17_weather_summer-heat-temperatures-us-climate", "text": "Heat is normal during the summer, but this year\u2019s has been anything but, and halfway through the season\u2019s hottest month it\u2019s clear this one is for the record books. Hundreds of cities in nearly every US state \u2013 including parts of Alaska and Hawaii \u2013 are on track for one of their 10-warmest summers on record. About 100 of these cities are enduring their hottest start to summer on record. The deadly heat has not been unexpected. Forecasters have been warning of a searing\u00a0summer for months due to the troubling combination of a budding La Ni\u00f1a and a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Last summer was the warmest on record globally and one of the warmest for several states. But so far, this summer has felt even worse for many in the US. Extreme heat has baked almost all of the\u00a0Lower 48 so far this summer, but the worst of it has concentrated in the East Coast states and West. Average daily temperatures \u2013 calculated by taking the average of each day\u2019s high and low \u2013 have soared several degrees above normal for hundreds of cities since June 1. These temperatures are a more complete indicator of how hot the season has been, as they factor in both hotter days and warmer nights. Summer nights in the US have been warming nearly twice as fast as summer days since records began in the late 1800s, according to data from NOAA. Warmer nights increase the danger of heat by compounding heat stress through a reduction in the amount of time the body has to cool down naturally. Las Vegas is experiencing its hottest summer on record and holds the top spot in the entire country. Many of the cities experiencing the most exceptional summer heat are in the West, notably in or near California\u2019s Central Valley. Searing heat there has been relentless since it started in early June. On the opposite coast, a historic mid-June heat wave has only been spelled by brief bouts of relief. Dozens of cities from New England to the Mid-Atlantic are experiencing their hottest start to the summer on record, including Washington, DC, which just smashed a high temperature record Tuesday when it hit 104 degrees. Some of the most abnormal heat in the region is focused in New England and New York state. The\u00a0South has also sweltered under more than its fair share of historic heat so far this summer.\u00a0Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, are both on pace to record their hottest summer on record.\u00a0For some locations in the region, it\u2019s the second consecutive year summer has had a blistering start. Last summer ended up quite warm for the Lower 48, but the worst heat was confined to the Gulf Coast. By mid-July last summer, the season was pacing as one of the warmest on record for cities nearest the coast, including cities like New Orleans, Houston and Brownsville, Texas. But in other parts of the country, last summer was downright cool compared to this year\u2019s extreme heat. Washington, DC, is currently on track to record its hottest summer on record, but it was only the 44th-warmest summer by this time last year. Sacramento, California, is experiencing its hottest start to summer on record. But this time last year California\u2019s capital city was experiencing is 62nd-warmest summer. Forecasts for the rest of the season aren\u2019t cool, either. Despite some upcoming brief periods of respite, much of the Lower 48 is expected to endure above-average temperatures through August and into September, according to the Climate Prediction Center.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/weather/summer-heat-temperatures-us-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_sport_zhou-guanyu-history-maker-profile-f1-spt-intl", "text": "There have been 776 drivers in the 74-year history of the Formula One World Championship, but the sport had never had a Chinese racer until the arrival of Zhou Guanyu. After getting his chance in 2022, the Kick Sauber (formerly Alfa Romeo) driver has blazed a trail for his nation across three seasons in F1, even if he had to wait to achieve his dream of racing in front of his home fans. The Chinese Grand Prix, which had been a fixture of the F1 calendar since 2004, was suspended between 2020 and 2023 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and its restrictions. F1 did eventually return to Shanghai earlier this year, and Zhou took to the track in front of an adoring home crowd. His 14th place finish in the grand prix was almost secondary on a weekend that he described on social media as \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Around 60,000 fans packed the stands on each day of the race weekend. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s more about bringing a sport (to China) that is probably not relevant to us or not so popular for us,\u201d Zhou told CNN at a recent Zero Petroleum\u2019s Fuel Reinvented event. \u201cAnd when it looks like it\u2019s impossible, to get a drive on the grid and then to make that breakthrough to be the first one, in China it basically gives a lot of hopes for the younger generations.\u201d Chasing a dream Zhou began his motorsport career in karting, getting into racing at eight years old. He left China four years later, moving to Sheffield, England to continue his development with the Strawberry Racing Karting team. He enjoyed success in the UK, winning multiple titles before being signed to the prestigious Ferrari Driver Academy. He then progressed into open-wheel racing and competed in various junior series, such as Formula Three, before joining the Alpine (then Renault) academy in 2018 ahead of his jump to Formula Two. A third-place finish in the F2 championship in 2021 caught the eye of F1\u2019s Alfa Romeo, who signed Zhou to a multi-year deal and gave him his opportunity on the biggest stage as part of an overhaul of its driver lineup partnering the incoming Valtteri Bottas. An arduous journey \u2013 that began with Zhou moving all the way across the world as a child in pursuit of his dream \u2013 was finally complete \u201cAll these achievements, sacrifice, anticipating we\u2019ve done as a family, as a group of people in my team \u2013 I\u2019ve just been really grateful to have them there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe finally achieved the goal that looked like it was impossible at the beginning.\u201d \u2018I went through it all\u2019 At the opening of the 2022 season in Bahrain, Zhou scored points at the first time of asking, coming home to finish 10th on debut. However, Zhou has had an up-and-down two and a half seasons in F1. He finished in the points on a further five occasions and came within two places of scoring on several occasions, despite the Sauber car often being uncompetitive. He also has two fastest laps to his name. \u2018Obviously, (it\u2019s been) only three years but time flies,\u201d said the 25-year-old Zhou. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve been through a lot of things, first year scoring points on debut and then having that big incident at Silverstone. Then having multiple technical issues that put me out of points. \u201cSo all these things, it\u2019s a bit more challenging, but I went through it all. I\u2019m quite happy with the achievement we did.\u201d Zhou might have only mentioned his 2022 incident at Silverstone in passing, but it is impossible to forget the horrific crash he sustained. At the start of that year\u2019s race, he made contact with Mercedes\u2019 George Russell, causing his Alfa Romeo to flip over, skid across the track and gravel upside-down for several seconds before flipping over the tire barrier and catch fencing, which is there to protect fans. It was one of the most terrifying crashes in recent years, but Zhou escaped unscathed and said afterwards that the halo protection device on his car saved his life. Having never been one to shy away from adversity, Zhou did not let the incident affect his rookie campaign or his career as a whole, looking back on what he has achieved positively. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the opportunity given by the Sauber group, who gave me the opportunity to reach my dream, to get on this grid,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of things I can improve on, so hopefully I\u2019ll be continuing for many more years on this grid.\u201d Driving with style Away from the racetrack, Zhou is known for his fashion sense and frequently turns heads with his outfits on race weekends, often sporting designer attire. He has drawn comparisons to seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton for his sartorial tastes, with Zhou crediting the Briton for helping drivers feel comfortable about expressing themselves in different ways in the paddock. His colorful helmet designs are just as eye-catching as his black and neon green Kick Sauber liveried car, which is emblazoned with the number 24 on it. Zhou explained that he was unable to use his favorite number three upon arriving in F1 as it was already being used by Daniel Ricciardo, while 33 had been used the season prior by Max Verstappen \u2013 numbers have to be out of use for two whole seasons before they become available again. As a result, he opted to pay tribute to one of his heroes, the late Kobe Bryant, who wore 24 on his jersey during the second part of his Hall of Fame NBA career. \u201cI wanted to have a number that means something to me,\u201d he said. \u201cKobe was an athlete I grew up watching him all the time, playing for the (Los Angeles) Lakers. I just had a massive inspiration \u2026 I just wanted to make sure that this number gives me energy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/sport/zhou-guanyu-history-maker-profile-f1-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Dramatic images showed a huge column of black smoke billowing from the 14-story building in the city of Zigong, Sichuan province. Several people were also seen gathered on a balcony. About 30 people were rescued from the blaze after nearly 300 emergency workers and dozens of vehicles were dispatched from the local fire department to the scene, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Preliminary investigations suggest the fire was caused by construction work, CCTV said, citing local authorities. In a statement Thursday, China\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Management urged rescue workers and provincial officials to determine the cause of the fire as soon as possible, and to learn lessons to ensure greater security in the future. Such incidents are not uncommon in China, where enforcement of safety standards is often lax.

{"id": "2024_07_19_middleeast_israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk", "text": "Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security lapses around a deadly drone blast in Tel Aviv that killed one man and injured at least 10 others on Friday. The attack was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, in what the Iranian proxy group said was a response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sare\u2019e said the\u00a0operation was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy\u2019s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Sare\u2019e said. \u201cOur operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.\u201d The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. In a televised briefing on Friday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.  A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli territory to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders. An Israeli military official said the drone was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to \u201chuman error.\u201d It was armed with a warhead\u00a0and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device\u2019s payload. The official didn\u2019t provide details about what the human error was but noted that Israel\u2019s aerial defense systems don\u2019t always operate autonomously. The Iron Dome defense system, for example, can operate in manual mode, where its radar detects and tracks incoming threats but needs input from an operator before launching an interceptor missile. According to an initial inquiry \u201cno sirens were activated\u201d during the incident,\u00a0the IDF said earlier. Jack Lew, the US Ambassador to Israel, said Friday he was \u201cshocked by the brazen Houthi drone attack\u201d and sent his condolences to the victims\u2019 families. \u201cWe are thankful our US Embassy Branch Office personnel are safe,\u201d he added. Deadly explosion The explosion occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, and hit about 100 meters (330 feet) from a US Embassy branch office, according to CNN analysis and information from local authorities. There was no damage to the US diplomatic mission\u00a0and\u00a0no reports of injuries of US personnel or \u201clocally engaged staff,\u201d the US State Department said. \u201cWe are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens. Emergency crews responded to \u201can object\u201d that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. \u201cThe dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,\u201d MDA paramedic Roi Klein said. At least four of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds, the MDA said. Israeli far-right\u00a0National Security\u00a0Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Israeli government for being unable to protect the country, saying on social media that the attack showed the government \u201ccannot give security to the citizens of Israel.\u201d \u201cThere are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions are about themselves,\u201d he said. Ben Gvir said the attack on Tel Aviv and other areas of Israel are \u201cprecisely why I insist on being around the table in determining Israel\u2019s\u00a0policy.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June disbanded the country\u2019s war cabinet after former war cabinet member Benny Gantz announced his withdrawal from the body, and Ben Gvir asked to join. Houthi attacks The Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles since the start of the country\u2019s war with Hamas, most of which have been intercepted by Israel\u2019s defenses. The Houthis have also been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7\u00a0attack, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others kidnapped. Israel\u2019s air and ground offensive\u00a0on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of the strip\u2019s population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. The war has raised fears of a wider regional conflict, with the potential consequences of further human suffering and shocks to the global economy. The Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, for instance, have forced some of the world\u2019s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the most important maritime trade routes. Sare\u2019e, the Houthi spokesperson, said the operation targeting Tel Aviv was carried out with a new drone called \u201cYafa\u201d that can \u201cbypass the enemy\u2019s interception system and (is) undetectable by radars.\u201d Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, wrote on X that Houthi claims shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value. \u201cIn general, Houthi claims are a mixed bag. Sometimes they are accurate, sometimes they are exaggerated, sometimes they are just straight-up fabrications,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201ctheir factual claims have to be taken with a much bigger grain of salt than Iran\u2019s or Lebanese Hezbollah\u2019s.\u201d He said however that the drone used in the Tel Aviv attack is likely to be a Sammad, \u201cthe Houthi\u2019s standard long-range strike drone\u201d that has already been used in attacks against Israel, but with a more powerful engine. For the Houthis, he wrote, an extended drone range would be attractive \u201cas it would allow them to strike targets further away, fly routes evading enemy defenses, and attack from unexpected angles.\u201d Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN that the Houthis are likely to capitalize on the attack, especially as Israel\u2019s defenses failed to intercept it. \u201cThey will capitalize on it, not just inside Yemen but also outside Yemen,\u201d Nagi said, adding that the attack took place ahead of the rebel group\u2019s weekly rallies, which take place every Friday in support of Gaza in Houthi-controlled Yemeni cities. The attack \u201cgives momentum\u201d to these rallies, he said. The drone attack Friday in Tel Aviv comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq. The IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.

{"id": "style_ciel-tower-dubai-yahya-jan-spc", "text": "If you look out onto the Dubai skyline, you\u2019re likely to be admiring the work of Yahya Jan. He is president and design director of architecture and engineering firm NORR, which is behind some of the city\u2019s best-known landmarks, including the Atlantis and Shangri-La Hotels. Now he is working on one of his most ambitious creations. Due for completion by the end of 2024, the Ciel Dubai Marina, colloquially called Ciel Tower, will have more than 1,000 rooms and suites spread over 82 floors \u2014 and at around 1,200 feet (365 meters) high, it is set to become the world\u2019s tallest hotel. A passion project For the project, Jan was tasked with designing the skyscraper on a triangular plot of land at Dubai Marina with an area of just 2,500 square meters \u2013 small for a building of that height. \u201cIt\u2019s a property that\u2019s very compressed,\u201d he told CNN in 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s like what you would face in Manhattan or London. The constraints were tremendous, and yet we had to make it work.\u201d A glass observation deck will offer 360-degree views of the city, as well as the coastline and iconic landmarks such as the Palm Jumeirah man-made island, according to the developer, The First Group. Visitors will also be able to take in the sights from a rooftop swimming pool and restaurants. As well as appealing to the senses, the project is energy efficient, using 25% less power for air conditioning than is typical for similar buildings, Jan said. \u201cThis project is not just about architecture. It\u2019s about architecture and engineering coming together,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love the project so much. It \u2026 is my passion, the convergence of science and art.\u201d Throughout the build, Jan said he has been \u201cextremely involved\u201d in the work. \u201cWhen you design a project as complex as the Ciel, you can never let your guard down, you can never say it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuous process.\u201d An extended stay When Jan first arrived in Dubai in 1996, he never envisioned he would leave such a legacy, designing some of the city\u2019s most iconic office developments, residential towers and malls. He grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, and moved to the US aged 18 on a scholarship. After studying structural engineering at Princeton, he got a Master\u2019s in architecture. After that, Jan worked in the US for nine years and had no intention of leaving until he received a job offer as a senior designer working on the Emirates Towers office and hotel complex. Now aged 61, he said that he never planned to stay in the UAE for so long, now having spent 28 years in Dubai. \u201cI got carried away with the excitement here,\u201d he said. As for the Ciel Tower \u2014 named for the French word for sky \u2014 Jan hopes that it will come to be seen as timeless, like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building in New York City. \u201cThe reason I like the fact that it\u2019s called Ciel is because I believe in our own lives the sky is the limit, and that\u2019s the case certainly in my own life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to grow, to do things that I didn\u2019t think I would get a chance to do.
