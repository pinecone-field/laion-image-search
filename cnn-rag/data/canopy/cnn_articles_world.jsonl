{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "Five Americans have been arrested in Turks and Caicos over the past six months under gun control laws that make bringing firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police a crime. Michael Lee Evans, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, of Oklahoma; and Tyler Wenrich, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. All have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers who went to the British Overseas Territory in May as part of efforts to petition for their expedited release. Though the infractions had carried a mandatory 12-year prison sentence and fine \u2013 with reductions only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2013 a mid-June revision clarified courts may impose a fine, a custodial sentence or both in exceptional circumstances, a member of the territory\u2019s House of Assembly said June 14. Four Americans arrested under the law have pleaded guilty, been sentenced and returned to the US, while the last is due in court next week. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the laws in Turks and Caicos and the affected Americans: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased \u2013 and that\u2019s a worry, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The mandatory sentence was in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. Judges could use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d she said. But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said: \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly.\u201d Even so, the \u201camendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity,\u201d House of Assembly member\u00a0Edwin\u00a0Astwood said in a statement. \u201cThis often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender.\u201d US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick has said, and none got a 12-year sentence. While Turks and Caicos collaborates with the US in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to the United States after he received a suspended 52-week sentence in late May, which meant he didn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He got home May 24, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. Arriving at Pittsburgh International Airport, Hagerich told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife had packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home \u2013 they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark; you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced May 28 to three weeks time-served in jail and fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, a Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands spokesperson said that day in a statement. He returned home to Virginia on May 30. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9 mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. He was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation and to attend his June sentencing hearing virtually, said his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel. Evans got a suspended 33-month sentence, and his attorney believes it is unlikely he will have to serve time in jail. \u201cIf he has no problems in (Turks and Caicos) within 12 months, he will not have to do any time,\u201d Smith told CNN on June 24. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays when he was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. He plead guilty in May. The first of the Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, he got a suspended 13-week sentence and a $2,000 fine, or $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on June 21. Watson soon returned home and reunited with his family, US Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said on X. Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was\u00a0arrested in mid-May and is awaiting trial after making bail, Tynes said\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. The Florida mother had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said. Grier\u2019s next court appearance is July 5, police said. US lawmakers tried to free Americans The Americans\u2019 arrest has stoked tension between US officials and their counterparts just a few hundred miles away. A request by a US congressional delegation to the islands in May for charges against the five Americas to be dropped did not yield the desired result. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Republican US Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said May 20 in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully (in) Turks and Caicos,\u201d Republican US Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler told ABC News the same week. Meanwhile, the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the United Nations for humanitarian concerns, Reschenthaler told CNN. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler wanted to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on May 20. \u201cThey were innocent mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On May 28, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, calling it \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

Russian state news agency TASS, quoting law enforcement agencies, reported Monday that five of the attackers who targeted the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala on Sunday had been identified. Gunmen opened fire at multiple places of worship and a police traffic stop in the two cities in the Muslim-majority republic on Sunday, killing at least 15 police officers and at least four civilians, including an Orthodox priest, according to authorities. Some of the attackers were from the Sergokalinsky district, which lies between the two cities, and were related to the head of the district, TASS reported. Former mixed martial arts fighter Gadzhimurad Kagirov \u2013 a cousin of the head of the Sergokalinsky district Magomed Omarov \u2013 was among those who attacked sites in Derbent, according to TASS. A son and a nephew of Omarov were also among the attackers, TASS reported. The head of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov, told reporters Monday that Omarov had since been relieved from his post and expelled from one of the main parties in the Russian parliament, the United Russia party. Melikov didn\u2019t specify how many of Omarov\u2019s relatives were allegedly involved in the attacks.

{"id": "2024_06_23_weather_flooding-upper-midwest-heat-wave-mid-atlantic", "text": "Millions of people across the US are still trudging through a record-setting heat wave that is shifting to the mid-Atlantic, while many Americans \u2013 including those in areas of New Mexico, Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota \u2013 contend with \u201ccatastrophic\u201d flash flooding this weekend. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022\u00a0More than 11 million people are under a tornado watch: A tornado watch was issued Sunday for much of New England, including the entire states of Vermont and New Hampshire and parts of New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The threat continues until 8 p.m. ET for cities including Burlington, Vermont; Albany, New York; Hartford, Connecticut; Providence, Rhode Island; and Portland, Maine, plus the suburbs of Boston. A line of strong thunderstorms could bring tornadoes, damaging winds up to 70 mph and hail the size of ping pong balls, according to the Storm Prediction Center.  \u2022\u00a0Heat wave shifts to mid-Atlantic: As heat alerts persist for over 100 million people over the weekend, the\u00a0extreme heat risk\u00a0will spread from the Ohio Valley on Saturday to the mid-Atlantic on Sunday. Highs across the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic have been 10 to 15 degrees above average. \u201cAn intense heat wave will continue across the Mid-Atlantic, where record high temperatures are likely. In the West, triple-digit high temperatures are possible in central and southern California, Arizona, and Utah,\u201d the National Weather Service said Sunday on its website. \u2022\u00a0Temperatures break records: Triple-digit heat broiled Baltimore and Washington, DC, on Saturday. The nation\u2019s capital hit the 100-degree mark Saturday \u2014 the first time that\u2019s happened since 2016. It\u2019s also the first time DC has recorded a temperature that high this early in the summer since 2012. Baltimore also hit 101 degrees, breaking the daily record of 100 degrees set back in 1988. The combination of this heat coming early in the summer season and persisting over several days \u201cincreases the level of heat stress for those without reliable air conditioning,\u201d the weather service said. \u2022 Iowa flooding prompts evacuations and disaster proclamation: In Rock Valley, Iowa, all homes north of Highway 18 were evacuated amid high floodwaters Saturday. \u201cI cannot even believe what I\u2019m seeing right now,\u201d said Daniel Heitritter, who evacuated his neighborhood in Spencer on Saturday. As water in his home reached shin-deep, he flagged down a boat to come pick him, his wife and cat up, he said. On Saturday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties in northwest Iowa and directed all available state resources to assist Rock Valley and other communities in response to \u201ccatastrophic flooding.\u201d On Sunday, Reynolds said she submitted a request for an expedited presidential major disaster declaration. She is asking for additional federal assistance for nine counties and public assistance for 22 counties. \u2022\u00a0People rescued from rising water in South Dakota: In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people were rescued from rising water due to heavy rain, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith. Emergency personnel responded to five stranded drivers, 30 vehicles stalled in water, 10 calls regarding water problems and 75 traffic accidents, according to Smith. City of Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken on Saturday signed an emergency declaration in response to the flooding. The cumulative rainfall amounts for the Sioux Falls region range from 6.5 to 8 inches over the last 72 hours, TenHaken said. \u2022 Emergency flood operations readied in Minnesota: Parts of Minnesota were under flood warnings Saturday night, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to declare an emergency authorizing the Minnesota National Guard \u201cto be available to provide support for emergency flood operations as areas across the state experience extreme flood conditions,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. Water in lakes Tetonka and Sakatah has reached \u201cuncontrollable\u201d levels. \u201cResidents have been evacuated and the flood has already caused significant damage,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cIntense rain has had catastrophic effects. Flooding has left entire communities under feet of water, causing severe damage to property and numerous road closures,\u201d Walz said in a statement. The warnings were still in effect on Sunday for southern parts of the state, as well as northwest Iowa and southeast South Dakota.  \u2022 New Mexico residents to return home after wildfire: The Salt and South Fork blazes in New Mexico have together burned over 25,300 acres. The South Fork Fire was 31% contained and the Salt Fire was 7% contained as of Sunday morning. Residents of the village of Ruidoso will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and officials advised them to bring at least a week\u2019s worth of food and drinking water as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Although rain in the area could help with fire suppression, it can also cause flooding as well as mud and debris flows\u00a0in the burn scars. Meanwhile, the FBI is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading them to the cause of the wildfires. \u2022 Storms move into Northeast: Severe thunderstorms were pouring down on areas of New England on Sunday, and a severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for parts of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia until 10 p.m. ET. There is also an excessive risk of rainfall in the Upper Midwest on Monday and Tuesday. New England is facing the potential for damaging winds, a few tornadoes and isolated hail, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Elsewhere, monsoon-like conditions may also produce isolated flash flooding in the Four Corners region, the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/weather/flooding-upper-midwest-heat-wave-mid-atlantic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_china_china-rocket-debris-falls-over-village-intl-hnk", "text": "Suspected debris from a Chinese rocket was seen plummeting to the ground over a village in southwest China on Saturday, leaving a trail of bright yellow smoke and sending villagers running, according to videos on Chinese social media and sent to CNN by a local witness. The dramatic footage surfaced online shortly after a Long March 2C carrier rocket blasted off at 3p.m. local time Saturday (3 a.m. Eastern Time) from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the southwestern province of Sichuan. The rocket sent into orbit the Space Variable Objects Monitor, a powerful satellite developed by China and France to study the farthest explosion of stars known as gamma-ray bursts. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to establish the country as a dominant space power, ramping up missions to compete with other major world powers, including the United States. Saturday\u2019s launch was declared a \u201ccomplete success\u201d by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), a state-owned contractor that developed the Long March 2C rocket. CNN has reached out to the CASC and the State Council Information Office, which handles press inquiries for the Chinese government, including its space agency, for comment. A video posted on Kuaishou, a Chinese short-video site, appeared to show a long, cylindrical shaped piece of debris falling over a rural village and crashed next to a hill, with yellow smoke billowing from one end. CNN geolocated the video to be filmed from Xianqiao village in Guizhou province, neighboring the launch site province of Sichuan to the southeast.\u00a0The video was posted on Kuaishou from an IP address in Guizhou. Other videos circulating on Chinese social media platforms analyzed by CNN showed multiple angles of the falling debris. In one of them, villagers, including children, were seen running away while looking back at the orange trail in the sky, with some covering their ears for the crash. Some videos had been taken down by Monday afternoon. Witnesses on social media said they heard a loud explosion after the debris crashed into the ground. An\u00a0eyewitness told CNN they saw the rocket fall with their \u201cown eyes.\u201d \u201cThere was a pungent smell and the sound of an explosion,\u201d they added. In a now-deleted government notice reposted by a local villager shortly after the launch, authorities said that Xinba Town, near Xianqiao village,\u00a0was going to carry out a \u201crocket debris recovery mission\u201d from 2:45 p.m. to 3:15 p.m.\u00a0local time on Saturday. Residents were asked to leave their homes and other buildings an hour before the launch and scatter out in more open areas to observe the sky. They were warned to keep away from the debris to prevent harm from \u201ctoxic gas and explosion,\u201d according to the notice. Residents were also \u201cstrictly forbidden\u201d to take photos of the debris or \u201cspread relevant videos online,\u201d the notice said. There were no reports of immediate injuries from local authorities. \u2018Extremely toxic\u2019 Markus Schiller, a rocket expert and associate senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the debris appeared to be the first-stage booster of the Long March 2C rocket, which uses a liquid propellant consisting of nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). \u201cThis combination always creates these orange smoke trails. It\u2019s extremely toxic and carcinogenic,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cEvery living being that inhales that stuff will have a hard time in the near future,\u201d he added. Such incidents happen frequently in China due to the location of its launch site, he said. \u201cIf you want to launch something to low Earth orbit, you usually launch it in the easternly direction to get some extra boost from the rotation of the Earth. But if you launch to the east, there are definitely always some villages in the pathway of the boosters of the first stage.\u201d Most rockets in China are blasted from the country\u2019s three inland launch sites \u2013 Xichang in the southwest, Jiuquan in the Gobi Desert in the northwest, and Taiyuan in the north. Built during the Cold War, these bases were deliberately located far from the coast\u00a0out of security concerns. In 2016, a fourth launch site, Wenchang, opened in Hainan Island, the country\u2019s southernmost province. In comparison, NASA and the European Space Agency usually launch their rockets from coastal locations toward the ocean, said Schiller, who\u2019s also a director of ST Analytics in Munich, Germany. Western space agencies have also largely phased out the kind of highly toxic liquid propellants for their civilian space programs, which China \u2013 and Russia \u2013 still use, he added. Multi-staged rockets shed debris shortly after blast-off, along trajectories that can be predicted before the launch. Before each launch, China\u2019s civil aviation authority typically issues a notice to pilots, known as NOTAM, to warn them against the \u201ctemporary danger areas\u201d where rocket debris are likely to be falling. Debris from Chinese rockets have hit villages before. In December 2023, the debris of a rocket landed in southern Hunan Province, damaging two houses, state media reported.\u00a0In 2002, a boy in northern China was injured when fragments from a satellite launch fell on his village in Shaanxi province. \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see something like that for quite a while, for many years to come,\u201d Schiller said. China has previously faced criticism from the international space community for its handling of debris from its out-of-control rocket boosters when they reenter Earth. In 2021, NASA lambasted China for its failure to \u201cmeet responsible standards\u201d after debris from its out-of-control Long March 5B rocket plunged into the Indian Ocean just west of the Maldives after reentering the atmosphere.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/china/china-rocket-debris-falls-over-village-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_asia_us-aircraft-carrier-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "A United States Navy aircraft carrier has arrived in South Korea for a show of force as Washington, Seoul and Tokyo released a joint statement on Monday condemning deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia. The nuclear-powered USS Theodore Roosevelt docked in the port of Busan on Saturday ahead of trilateral exercises with South Korea and Japan in the waters near the peninsula. The Freedom Edge exercises resulted from an agreement made by the defense chiefs of the US, South Korea and Japan before Russian leader Vladimir Putin made his high-profile  trip to Pyongyang last week. But the strongly worded joint statement the three partners released Monday shows the gravity with which they view a new \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d between North Korea and Russia made during Putin\u2019s trip. Besides signing the defense deal with Kim Jong Un, Putin also linked security on the Korean Peninsula to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, threatening to arm North Korea should South Korea provide military aid to Kyiv. The US, South Korea and Japan \u201ccondemn in the strongest possible terms deepening military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia,\u201d the joint statement said, using the acronym for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, North Korea\u2019s official name. Deepened ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, and the mutual defense pact \u201cshould be of grave concern to anyone with an interest in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, upholding the global non-proliferation regime, and supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia\u2019s brutal aggression,\u201d it said. The joint statement comes after all three partners separately expressed deep concerns over the treaty, including South Korea condemning it and summoning Russia\u2019s ambassador on Friday, a rare diplomatic step that illustrates the soured tensions between Seoul and Moscow. The aircraft carrier\u2019s presence in Busan is just the latest in a series of US military moves to show Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to its own treaty ally in South Korea. Earlier this month, US Air Force B-1B bombers participated in a live-fire exercise on the peninsula, the first time in seven years those long-range strike aircraft have dropped live munitions in South Korea. And last week, a US Air Force AC-130 gunship also performed live-fire strikes on the same range where the B-1s dropped their bombs. Joint drills with the US have long been a source of frustration and ire for North Korea which has pressed ahead with its illegal nuclear weapons program and missile testing under Kim, who has found a common cause with Putin. Russia, which once supported sanctions on North Korea, used its veto power in the United Nations earlier this year to shield Pyongyang from further scrutiny and Putin has backed often backed Kim\u2019s narrative. \u201cThis confrontational policy on the part of the US to expand its military infrastructure in the subregion was accompanied by significant increases in the intensity and scale of military drills involving South Korea and Japan that are hostile towards North Korea,\u201d Putin said in Pyongyang on Wednesday. The visit of the USS Theodore Roosevelt to Busan marks the second time a Nimitz-class carrier has visited South Korea in seven months. The USS Carl Vinson called in Busan last November. The Roosevelt, with some 5,000 personnel aboard, carries an air wing of more than 60 aircraft, including F/A-18 Super Hornet fighters. The presence of the Roosevelt and its carrier strike group of supporting warships \u201cdemonstrates the solid combined defense posture and resolute will of the South Korea-US alliance to respond to the sophisticating threat from North Korea,\u201d a statement from the South Korean military said. Neither the US nor South Korea would give details or exact dates of the upcoming Freedom Edge exercise. But the three have been working more closely together, including recent exercises involving forces from all three countries. The Pentagon on Sunday gave a clue as to the timing of the Freedom Edge exercise, releasing a statement saying the Roosevelt would be departing the Indo-Pacific theater next week and heading to the Middle East to replace the carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Eisenhower left the region on Saturday after more than seven months of operations that included attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen to protect commercial shipping in the region from the Iran-backed group\u2019s missiles and drones. The movement of the Roosevelt from the western Pacific leaves temporarily only one US carrier in the region, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is homeported in Yokosuka, Japan.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/us-aircraft-carrier-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

The region has been battered by heavy rainfall over the last week, causing deadly flooding and landslides that have killed at least 71 people, according to Chinese state media. Southern Guangdong province, an economic powerhouse home to 127 million people, is subject to annual flooding from April to September. But the coastal region has faced more intense rainstorms and severe flooding in recent years as scientists warn the climate crisis will amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent. After\u00a0displacing tens of thousands of people in Guangdong, the storms have moved slightly northward into southern central China, with footage emerging of waterlogged highways and a swamped metro system in Hunan province. On Monday, China\u2019s Meteorological Administration hoisted the highest red rainstorm signal for the first time this year. It warned of\u00a0high risks of torrential rain in several provinces. The high-risk area stretches from Chongqing province in the west to Zhejiang in the east, covering Hubei, Hunan and Anhui provinces. China\u2019s State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters accelerated its flood response to level 3 (level 1 is the most urgent response) in the provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi and Hunan on Monday, Chinese state media reported. Cars floated down city streets and people waded through flooded subway tunnels Monday in Changsha, one of the hardest hit areas in the capital of Hunan province in southern central China. Local rivers rose a record 4.59 meters (15 feet), according to Chinese state broadcaster CGTN. The state-run weather service measured 65.1 millimeters (2.5 inches) of rainfall in Changsha in a single hour \u2013\u00a0a new record for the city in June \u2013\u00a0shuttering tourist attractions and two local subway lines. Emergency crews transported residents to and from their homes in rubber boats, Reuters reported. No deaths were immediately reported in Changsha, but fatalities have been reported across multiple provinces and cities. Mountain torrents, which occur when heavy rainfall in a mountainous area causes sudden and extreme rushes of water, killed five people on June 21 in Yuanlin county, Hunan, CCTV reported Monday, bringing the death toll in that province to at least 13. More than 300 villagers in Taoyuan county, Hunan were also unreachable Tuesday, CCTV reported. At least 511,000 people in 29 cities and counties in Anhui province, northeast of Hunan, have been affected by relentless rainfall and flooding and 64,000 have been forced to relocate as of Monday morning, according to CCTV. Last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for all-out efforts to safeguard lives and property, as China grapples with the heavy rains in the south and severe drought and record temperatures in the north.

{"id": "2024_06_20_europe_france-alleged-rape-anti-semitism-intl-latam", "text": "The\u00a0alleged gang-rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl in northern France has triggered an outcry over surging antisemitism in the country, a key issue in the looming French parliamentary elections this month. Politicians from all sides have weighed in on the alleged attack, with French President Emmanuel Macron condemning a \u201cscourge of antisemitism\u201d\u00a0that he said is\u00a0festering in French schools, and far-right leaders placing blame on the left for failing to take anti-semitism seriously enough. The Nanterre prosecutor\u2019s office announced Wednesday that it has launched an inquiry into the\u00a0alleged \u201caggravated rape\u201d of a minor, after receiving \u201creports from a 12-year-old girl\u201d\u00a0of the incident on June 15.  Three boys, aged 12 and 13, have been taken into custody, the prosecutor also said. Whether the girl was targeted for her religion is part of the probe, with two of the boys now being investigated for\u00a0aggravated gang rape of a minor, group violence against a minor for reasons of religion, death threats and insult for reasons of religion, according to the prosecutor\u2019s statement. The third boy\u00a0has been\u00a0placed under \u201cassisted witness\u201d status in relation to the alleged rape, the prosecutor added. The alleged attack took place as the girl tried to return home after meeting a friend. Two boys\u00a0approached her and attempted to block her path outside her house. After a third boy\u00a0arrived,\u00a0the group began to physically attack the girl, hurling antisemitic insults at her, BFMTV reported,\u00a0citing police sources. The girl received several death threats and one of the boys called her\u00a0a \u201cdirty Jew,\u201d according to the account reported by BFMTV. Antisemitic incidents have increased by 284% in France between 2022 and 2023, according to data from the French interior ministry. In 2023, antisemitic acts constituted 60% of all anti-religious acts, compared to 26% in 2022, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told the French Senate earlier this year. Growing fears of an antisemitism problem The incident has sparked an intense political debate on what politicians have described as a spiraling\u00a0antisemitism problem in France\u00a0linked to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. On Wednesday,\u00a0Jordan Bardella, the far-right firebrand hoping to score big wins for his National Rally party in the upcoming elections, pledged to tackle antisemitism if elected in three weeks\u2019 time. \u201cSince October 7, an atmosphere of anti-Semitism has spread and developed in an extremely worrying manner in our country, which we must combat,\u201d Bardella told reporters. Bardella\u2019s party colleague and far-right juggernaut, Marine Le Pen said in a post on X that the attack revolted members of her party, highlighting the uptick in antisemitic incidents across the country. Le Pen said the recent surge in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war reveals a worrying \u201cstigmatization\u201d of Jewish people which \u201ceveryone should be fully aware of\u201d when hitting the ballot boxes on June 30 and July 7. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal meanwhile described the incident as a \u201cdespicable\u201d and took direct aim at his left-wing political opponent, Jean-Luc Melenchon, whom he accused of previously downplaying the severity of antisemitism in France by describing it as a \u201cresidual\u201d issue. Politicians in France have a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to ensure that antisemitic rhetoric does not become \u201ctrivialized,\u201d Attal said in an interview with TF1 Info Wednesday, warning that if trivialized it can lead young people in particular to \u201cthe worst.\u201d Melenchon for his part said he was \u201chorrified by this rape,\u201d saying in a social media post that \u201cit put under a concerning spotlight the conditioning of criminal male behavior from a young age, and antisemitic racism.\u201d Voter anger over the issue appeared clear on Wednesday, as demonstrators gathered outside Paris\u2019s city hall on, according to reporting from BFMTV. Protesters carried placards with slogans such as \u201cRaped at 12 because she was Jewish,\u201d and \u201cAnti-Semitism is not residual,\u201d and listened to speeches from Jewish rights activists in attendance. \u201cAll light must be shed on the circumstances of this crime, including its anti-Semitic nature, if this is confirmed,\u201d the main Jewish interest group in France, the Conseil repr\u00e9sentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF) said.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_highlights-menswear-shows-paris-fashion-week", "text": "Paris may be readying itself for the Summer Olympics, but sporting events are not the only buzzy affairs taking place in the French capital. This past week, fashion designers converged in the city for Paris Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2025 menswear collections \u2014 but nothing was business as usual. Both the menswear shows and the couture shows (now in full swing) were moved up a week to avoid interfering with sport\u2019s most celebrated event, and simmering political tensions ahead of the country\u2019s surprise snap election, called by President Emmanuel Macron, have filled the streets with near daily protests in the past few weeks. In this climate, there was no shortage of political commentary on the menswear runways, but perhaps the loudest by the American designers showing in the city. At Rick Owens\u2019 grandiose show at the Palais de Tokyo, which featured a near-all white collection mixing biblical references and Art Deco, he sent out a diverse cast of models whom he called his \u201cWhite Satin Army of Love\u201d and urged solidarity with one another. \u201cExpressing our individuality is great but sometimes expressing our unity and reliance on each other is a good thing to remember too\u2026 especially in the face of the peak intolerance we are experiencing in the world right now,\u201d he wrote in the show notes. Rapper A$AP Rocky, too, made a statement for his Paris Fashion Week debut \u2014 a secret show for his label AWGE, which launched earlier this year. Calling the presentation \u201cAmerican Sabotage,\u201d it was hosted in Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s former home, the 18th-century mansion H\u00f4tel de Maisons, and attended, of course, by\u00a0Rihanna, as well as Pusha T, Casey Affleck, and designers Jonathan Anderson and Willy Chavarria. Guests were greeted with invitations bearing an antiwar sign and cakes resembling guns and cocaine bags, for an air of dystopia. On the runway, models marched with their heads covered by American eagle flags, wore slogans like \u201cDon\u2019t be Dumb\u201d and carried plastic bags filled with cash. In the show notes, the rapper declared that his label is \u201cmore than just a brand\u2014it\u2019s a movement.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re wrecking boundaries and making statements through every piece, reflecting the spirit and resilience of our communities. This is fashion with purpose, where art meets activism,\u201d he explained. For his fourth showing with Louis Vuitton, Pharrell also played up military symbols, combining camouflage and damier \u2014 the luxury house\u2019s signature checkerboard \u2014 into \u201cdamoflage.\u201d The show, hosted at UNESCO headquarters, featured cartography graphics and military berets, and pointed to travel, aviation, international diplomacy and a creative dialogue \u2014 notably through collaborating with the creative collective Air Afrique on graphics. And then there was KidSuper, another majestic show with giant marionette hands to which the models staggered out like puppets. Designer Colm Dillane wanted to \u201cexplore interconnectedness and the unseen forces shaping our world,\u201d he wrote in show notes, inviting the audience to \u201creflect on autonomy\u201d and the narratives we each construct for ourselves. Subcultures as craft Elsewhere on the runways, designers brought subculture styles to the fore. German magazine 032C showed something akin to techno couture, which bridged a party-to-office lifestyle. Minimalist and functional, clothes spanned neon orange workwear to faux vintage sportswear to chokers and XXL cargo pants, all reminiscent of Berlin\u2019s legendary nightlife style. Junya Watanabe, meanwhile, presented a mix of tartan and heavy metal with reworked ACDC, Skorpions and Black Sabbath t-shirts onto a tailored wardrobe; and Doublet mixed club-kid aesthetics with suiting and graffitied tops. Models carried gold and silver pom poms \u2014 some as props, others as clutches \u2014 adding an unexpected accessory to both casual and more formal looks. And of course there was queer fashion label Jeanne Friot, with feather-adorned denim pants and belt bandeau skirts for all genders, entirely crafted out of deadstock. The designer wants to offer a wider range of expressions for men. \u201cFor me, punk today means\u2026 doing things locally, responsibly\u2026 just as much as addressing gender norms,\u201d Friot explained in an interview following the show. Pretty boys Across the menswear shows, other designers joined Friot in redefining what menswear looks like. Storied luxury house Comme des Gar\u00e7ons played with bright fuchsia tailoring and skirt pants, blending former gender distinctions. The layered maximalist collection featured ruffles, giant lapels and tulle, evoking the elaborate and delicate court attire of France\u2019s former monarchy rather than functional fashion. Japanese brand Sacai, meanwhile,\u00a0brought experimental couture to everyday clothes with a collection that focused on the joy and freedom of discovery, offering up\u00a0skirts-shorts, layered suits and giant bouffant sleeves.\u00a0The label Taakk also offered romantic lines, sheer shirts, floral motifs and a sense of delicacy, with candy-coloured silk and satin, as well as coiled pin curls worn by models. Last but not least, Etudes Studio centered its work on what artists might need, quoting Andy Warhol and notably Jean-Michel Basquiat as an inspiration for his \u201claid-back, nonchalant\u201d sense of elegance, as the trio of designers \u2014 J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Egry, Aur\u00e9lien Arnet and Jos\u00e9 Lamali \u2014 described backstage. Dries bids goodbye Belgian designer Dries Van Noten presented his final \u2014 and 150th \u2014 collection, stepping down from his role as of his eponymous brand after 38 years. Shown on a runway made of silver foil, the shimmery, delicate pieces were not a \u201cbest-of\u201d or a retrospective, but a final collection that will no doubt sell. The show received a standing ovation as\u00a0Donna Summer\u2019s \u201cI Feel Love\u201d set the ebullient mood. A giant disco ball appeared at the end of the runway welcoming the guests to join the party \u2014 a celebration for Van Noten to take his final bow.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/highlights-menswear-shows-paris-fashion-week/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_fehmarnbelt-tunnel-denmark-germany", "text": "Descending up to 40 meters beneath the Baltic Sea, the world\u2019s longest immersed tunnel will link Denmark and Germany, slashing journey times between the two countries when it opens in 2029. The first tunnel element of the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel was inaugurated June 17 by King Frederik X of Denmark, in what was a milestone moment four years after construction began in 2020, with more than a decade of planning preceding that. On the Danish side, east of R\u00f8dbyhavn, the factory that will build the 89 massive concrete sections that will make up the tunnel was completed last year. Fermern A/S, the state-owned Danish company in charge of the project, says it\u2019s the largest and most advanced production facility of its kind. The tunnel, which will be 18 kilometers (11.1 miles) long, is one of Europe\u2019s largest infrastructure projects, with a construction budget of over 7 billion euros ($7.1 billion). By way of comparison, the 50-kilometer (31-mile) Channel Tunnel linking England and France, completed in 1993, cost the equivalent of \u00a312 billion ($13.6 billion) in today\u2019s money. Although longer than the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel, the Channel Tunnel was made using a boring machine, rather than by immersing pre-built tunnel sections. It will be built across the Fehmarn Belt, a strait between the German island of Fehmarn and the Danish island of Lolland, and is designed as an alternative to the current ferry service from R\u00f8dby and Puttgarden, which carries millions of passengers every year. Where the crossing now takes 45 minutes by ferry, it will take just seven minutes by train and 10 minutes by car. Faster journey The tunnel, whose official name is Fehmarnbelt Fixed Link, will also be the longest combined road and rail tunnel anywhere in the world. It will comprise two double-lane motorways \u2013 separated by a service passageway \u2013 and two electrified rail tracks. \u201cToday, if you were to take a train trip from Copenhagen to Hamburg, it would take you around four and a half hours,\u201d Jens Ole Kaslund, technical director at Femern A/S, said in 2022. \u201cWhen the tunnel will be completed, the same journey will take two and a half hours. \u201cToday a lot of people fly between the two cities, but in the future it will be better to just take the train,\u201d he adds. The same trip by car will be around an hour faster than today, taking into account time saved by not lining up for the ferry. Besides the benefits to passenger trains and cars, the tunnel will have a positive impact on freight trucks and trains, Kaslund said, because it creates a land route between Sweden and Central Europe that will be 160 kilometers shorter than today. At the moment, traffic between the Scandinavian peninsula and Germany via Denmark can either take the ferry across the Fehmarnbelt or a longer route via bridges between the islands of Zealand, Funen and the Jutland peninsula. Work underway The project dates back to 2008, when Germany and Denmark signed a treaty to build the tunnel. It then took over a decade for the necessary legislation to be passed by both countries and for geotechnical and environmental impact studies to be carried out. While the process completed smoothly on the Danish side, in Germany a number of organizations \u2013 including ferry companies, environmental groups and local municipalities \u2013 appealed against the approval of the project over claims of unfair competition or environmental and noise concerns. In November 2020 a federal court in Germany dismissed the complaints. \u201cThe ruling came with a set of conditions, which we kind of expected and we were prepared for, on how we monitor the environment while we are constructing, on things like noise and sediment spill. I believe that we really need to make sure that the impact on the environment is as little as possible,\u201d Henrik Vincentsen, CEO of Femern A/S, said in 2022. Several other phases of the project are underway, including the digging of the actual trench that will host the tunnel. Each section will be 217 meters long (roughly half the length of the world\u2019s largest container ship), 42 meters wide and 9 meters tall. Weighing in at 73,000 metric tons each, they will be as heavy as more than 13,000 elephants. The factory has three halls and six production lines. The sections will be placed just beneath the seabed, about 40 meters below sea level at the deepest point, and moved into place by barges and cranes. Positioning the sections will take roughly three years. A wider impact Up to 2,500 people will work directly on the construction project. Michael Svane of the Confederation of Danish Industry, one of Denmark\u2019s largest business organizations, told CNN in 2022 that he believes the tunnel will be beneficial to businesses beyond Denmark itself. \u201cThe Fehmarnbelt tunnel will create a strategic corridor between Scandinavia and Central Europe. The upgraded railway transfer means more freight moving from road to rail, supporting a climate-friendly means of transport. We consider cross-border connections a tool for creating growth and jobs not only locally, but also nationally,\u201d he said. While some environmental groups have expressed concerns about the impact of the tunnel on porpoises in the Fehmarn Belt, Michael L\u00f8vendal Kruse of the Danish Society for Nature Conservation thinks the project will have environmental benefits. \u201cAs part of the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel, new natural areas and stone reefs on the Danish and German sides will be created. Nature needs space and there will be more space for nature as a result,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the biggest advantage will be the benefit for the climate. Faster passage of the Belt will make trains a strong challenger for air traffic, and cargo on electric trains is by far the best solution for the environment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/fehmarnbelt-tunnel-denmark-germany/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_flagstaff-arizona-best-towns-america", "text": "For years, Flagstaff was a place that you passed through on your way to the Grand Canyon or following Route 66 to the California shore. Unless you needed gas or a quick meal, there was little reason to stop. Yet slowly but surely, the northern Arizona city has transformed into a vacation destination in its own right. Flagstaff remains a gateway to the Grand Canyon and other natural wonders. But since the turn of the century, it\u2019s become more than just a pit stop. Nowadays, there are multiple reasons to linger in a city surrounded by the world\u2019s largest ponderosa pine forest at the base of the snowcapped San Francisco Peaks. A stark contrast to the desert cities of southern Arizona, Flagstaff offers cooler temperatures, fresh mountain air and a growing reputation for outdoor recreation ranging from winter skiing to summertime hiking, biking and trail running. The renaissance of downtown Flagstaff brought new life to its old brick buildings in the form of hip new places to eat, drink and sleep. With Lowell Observatory in the forefront, the city has become a hub of scientific research as well as being named the world\u2019s first official \u201cInternational Dark Sky City\u201d in 2001. Meanwhile, Northern Arizona University upped its game in athletics and academics, bringing even more attention and visitors to a place considered a backwater for many decades. With around 76,000 residents, Flagstaff is no longer a small town. Yet the vibe is anything but big city. Some of the first things you notice \u2014 a slower pace, the woodsy air and a star-filled night sky \u2014 are more or less absent from larger urban areas. Spectacular skies The university is what brought local ceramic artist Robin Cadigan to town, but she soon fell in love with Flagstaff\u2019s wide-open spaces, active lifestyle and flourishing creative community. \u201cA lot of people move here because of the landscape and natural beauty, the access to trails and mountains and the Grand Canyon,\u201d says Cadigan, who grew up in Maine. \u201cThere\u2019s like over 300 days of sun here a year. And it\u2019s a wonderful place to raise a family, especially if you like to do things outdoors with your kids. I love my tree time!\u201d she beams. (Sunny days may stack up a bit shy of 300, but not by much). Cadigan mentions Lowell Observatory as a place she often visits with her two kids for science-based summer camps or one-off astronomy programs aimed at locals and out-of-town visitors. In addition to tours, exhibits, stargazing and a chance to peer through historic telescopes, the observatory that discovered Pluto in 1930 is opening the new Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center (ADC) this fall. One of the most advanced astronomy centers anywhere on the planet, the ADC will feature a state-of-the-art theater with wrap-around screen and a curiosity zone for kids. It will also have the world\u2019s first dark sky planetarium on the top floor \u2014 a roofless viewing area with theater-like seats where visitors can look straight up at the sky while an astronomer explains what they\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s not Flagstaff\u2019s only connection to outer space. Meteor Crater shows the impact of a meteorite crashing into the Earth\u2019s surface around 50,000 years ago just east of town. The 10-day Flagstaff Festival of Science in September often features speakers from the city\u2019s lunar legacy, including scientists from the USGS Astrogeology Science Center, which helped design the Lunar Rover and map the surface of the moon and planets in our solar system. Buffalo Park on the mesa behind the Astrogeology Science Center is one of the city\u2019s best spots for stargazing and a venue for star parties organized by the Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition. Despite its heavenly reputation, it was things happening on the ground that really sparked Flagstaff\u2019s emergence as a bona fide travel destination. Downtown Flagstaff\u2019s rebirth Once upon a time, downtown Flagstaff was home to restaurants and bars that largely catered to locals who worked in the timber and ranching industries but not students or tourists. By the 1990s, even the cowboys and lumberjacks had stopped coming. Fortunately, many of the antique redbrick structures were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. So they couldn\u2019t be knocked down, and that left them ready for their transformation into today\u2019s shops, restaurants and entertainment outlets. Riffing off the historic buildings, new redbrick sidewalks and throwback street signs and lampposts have been installed. In the middle of downtown, a once vacant lot has been transformed into Heritage Square, a \u201ccommunity living room\u201d that hosts events in a 1,200-person capacity amphitheater and puts on exhibits on the city\u2019s history, biology, geology and anthropology. From summer outdoor movies and concerts to the Northern Arizona Book Festival in the spring and Flagstaff Music Festival in the fall, the square hosts scores of events throughout the year. Another anchor of Flagstaff\u2019s revitalized downtown is the Orpheum Theatre. Opened in 1916, the stage and movie palace fell into the same disrepair as the rest of the neighborhood but was saved from demolition and revived in the early 21st century to host a broad gamut of films and live performances. Another heirloom building, with an original 1888 pressed tin ceiling and sandstone fa\u00e7ade, houses Babbitts Backcountry Outfitters, where anyone headed for the great outdoors around Flagstaff can buy or rent gear. New on the downtown scene is Planet Science, which taps into the city\u2019s astro-tourism scene with merchandise such as meteorite fragments, NASA swag and spaceship models. Vintage clothing stores, fashion boutiques and Western art galleries also populate the revitalized downtown. A culinary shift The local food scene has also flipped the script. Dara Wong, the chef-owner of Shift Kitchen & Bar and Oeno Wine Lounge (and another NAU graduate), says downtown Flagstaff dining was \u201cvery steak and potatoes about 10 years ago\u201d when Shift debuted. \u201cI thought it was time for a little more fine dining \u2014 small plates and unique flavor combinations utilizing local products.\u201d Were local diners ready for such a drastic change? \u201cLike any new business,\u201d says Wong, \u201cit took a little bit of time. But we definitely got some wonderful regulars right off the bat, and I would say it was right on trend.\u201d That trend has brought a diverse range of eateries to downtown and the Southside neighborhood on the other side of the railroad tracks. Among the most talked about are modern American restaurant Atria, FLG Terroir: Wine Bar & Bistro and Beaver Street Brewery & Whistle Stop Caf\u00e9. The latter is one of eight stops on the Flagstaff Brewery Trail that highlights the city\u2019s top craft beermakers. The outdoor scene The city\u2019s location in the middle of Coconino National Forest and near the base of the San Francisco Peaks means it offers outdoor adventure opportunities for all seasons and just about every level of fitness. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to see professional runners come here to train because of the altitude and the access to different types of terrain,\u201d says local photographer and trail runner Austin Corbett. But you don\u2019t have to be a professional or competitive athlete to take off down the many trails that fan out from Flagstaff. The ever-expanding Flagstaff Urban Trails System (FUTS) stretches 56 miles (90 kilometers) through forests, fields and canyons. Hiking many of the sections of the Flagstaff Loop Trail surrounding town takes only one to two hours. A portion of the long-distance Arizona Trail meanders through the middle of the city on its way from the Mexican border to the Grand Canyon and beyond. The three sections around Flagstaff are long (averaging around five hours to hike) but not especially challenging. Humphreys Peak is ground zero for Flagstaff\u2019s winter sports scene. Or more specifically the Arizona Snowbowl in Coconino National Forest on the mountain\u2019s west side. The ski area boasts 55 runs, three terrain parks and eight lifts including an enclosed gondola. Topping out at 11,500 feet (3,500 meters), the resort recorded 23 feet (7 meters) of snow for the 2023-24 season. \u2018Living in heaven\u2019 Looming just north of Flagstaff, Humphreys is the highest of a handful of summits that comprise San Francisco Mountain \u2014 more commonly called San Francisco Peaks. In addition to its scenic and recreational roles, the mountain is revered by Native American groups including the Navajo, Hopi, Zuni and Apache peoples of northern Arizona. \u201cGrowing up in this area, the San Francisco Peaks \u2014 Dook\u02bco\u02bcoos\u0142\u00ed\u00edd as we call it in Navajo \u2014 is one of four sacred mountains for Navajo people. And being here, in this area, at the base of this mountain, is literally living in heaven,\u201d says Darrell R. Marks, a community activist, educator and Native American mentor at two Flagstaff high schools. Marks, winner of a 2021 JFK Profile in Courage Award, worked with his teenage sons to petition the state government to change the name of Agassiz Peak to \u00d6o\u2019mawki, its Hopi name \u2014 a change that was approved by Arizona officials last year.\u00a0As a member of the city\u2019s Indigenous Commission, Marks is advocating the development of cultural centers to host \u201cpublic events that celebrate indigenous culture, identity, voice, presence and share those narratives of just how important this area is to us.\u201d For the time being, he says the best way for visitors to tap into local Native American culture is attending the Flagstaff High School Powwow in May, which features more than 250 dancers and drummers or browsing the many Native American exhibits at the city\u2019s Museum of Northern Arizona. \u201cBefore curating and putting exhibits together,\u201d says Marks, the museum \u201cconsults with the tribes, brings them into the space and has them help organize what needs to be present. They\u2019ve done a really good job.\u201d Just outside Flagstaff are two significant Ancestral Puebloan sites \u2014 the 12th-13th century cliff dwellings of Walnut Canyon National Monument and the 12th century pueblos of Wupatki National Monument. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to celebrate in this space,\u201d says Marks of his hometown. \u201cThe variation is one of the things that blows my mind. One side of town could be snowing, and the other side could be sunny. And you have to drive a short distance to go from forests to the Painted Desert to grasslands with pronghorn antelope and Oak Creek Canyon. It\u2019s amazing how the landscape changes in just a couple of miles.\u201d Next town: Macon, Georgia is No. 7 Find out how this Southern town went from \u201cghost town\u201d to \u201cpopping\u201d destination.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/flagstaff-arizona-best-towns-america/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_gaza-famine-ipc-report-intl-latam", "text": "A high risk of famine persists in Gaza and the situation \u201cremains catastrophic\u201d as the war between Israel and Hamas continues, according to a report\u00a0released Tuesday by\u00a0the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). Nearly half a million are projected to face catastrophic levels of hunger, the most severe level on the IPC scale where people \u201cexperience an extreme lack of food, starvation, and exhaustion of coping capacities,\u201d according to the report. 96% of the population of Gaza \u2013 more than 2 million people \u2013 will face crisis, emergency, or catastrophic levels of food insecurity through at least the end of September, the report projects. \u201cA high risk of famine persists across the whole of the Gaza Strip as long as conflict continues and humanitarian access is restricted,\u201d the\u00a0report said. \u201cOnly the cessation of hostilities in conjunction with sustained humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip can reduce the risk of a famine occurring in the Gaza Strip.\u201d \u201cThe last few months have demonstrated that food and humanitarian access and malnutrition prevalence can change very quickly, the risk of epidemics is increasing and eight months of extreme pressure on the lives of the population make them much more vulnerable to collapse into famine,\u201d said the report, compiled by the IPC\u2019s Famine Review Committee. \u201cGiven the unpredictability of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian access challenges, any significant change may lead to a very rapid deterioration into Famine,\u201d the report said. The findings of the report echo testimonies from those on the ground about the dire humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Nearly nine months of Israel\u2019s bombardment and siege have depleted the health care system, battered water infrastructure and created dire conditions for the entire population of more than 2.2 million people. Increased Israeli attacks in the southern city of Rafah have triggered mass displacement and an outbreak of infectious diseases in the sprawling tent camps where people cannot access basic sanitation. With no signs of\u00a0an imminent ceasefire\u00a0being agreed to stop the fighting, relief workers say the suffering of civilians on the ground will only get worse. \u201cThe latest data shows\u00a0that, to be able to purchase food, more than half of the households had to exchange their clothes for money and one third resorted to picking up trash to sell,\u201d the report detailed in its \u201cspecial snapshot.\u201d \u201cMore than half also reported that, often, they do not have any food to eat in the house, and over 20 percent go entire days and nights without eating.\u201d The report acknowledged there were some improvements to the situation in the north of Gaza, where the IPC warned in March that famine was imminent. Tuesday\u2019s report assessed that due to an increase in food deliveries in March and April, \u201cthe available evidence does not indicate that Famine is currently occurring\u201d in the north. However, it notes the possibility remains throughout the entire Gaza Strip. Although there was also some improvement in the south of Gaza in that time, the report said, the situation deteriorated with the launch of Israel\u2019s military operations in Rafah. The Rafah crossing \u2013 a key transitway for humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2013 has been closed since early May, and only a handful of other land crossings remain open. Humanitarian aid workers continue to face tremendous risks to try to distribute the desperately needed aid to Gaza. The majority of the infrastructure to support humanitarian work in Gaza has been destroyed in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. \u201cThe humanitarian space in the Gaza Strip continues to shrink and the ability to safely deliver assistance to populations is dwindling,\u201d the report\u2019s special snapshot said. \u201cThe recent trajectory is negative and highly unstable. Should this continue, the improvements seen in April could be rapidly reversed.\u201d The report also \u201cencourages all stakeholders who use the IPC for high-level decision-making to understand that whether a Famine classification is confirmed or not does not in any manner change the fact that extreme human suffering is without a doubt currently ongoing in the Gaza Strip.\u201d It \u201cdoes not change the immediate humanitarian imperative to address this civilian suffering by enabling complete, safe, unhindered, and sustained humanitarian access into and throughout the Gaza Strip, including through ceasing hostilities,\u201d the report continued. \u2018Specter of famine continues to hang over Gaza\u2019 The United States, Israel\u2019s closest ally, has repeatedly called on the Netanyahu government to do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. US President Joe Biden warned in early April that Israel had to take immediate concrete steps or risk changes in US policy. Thus far, there have been no such changes in policy. A spokesperson for the US humanitarian agency USAID said in response to the report that \u201cthe scale of food insecurity in Gaza is staggering.\u201d \u201cMore than 2 million people are in need of food assistance And the inability of food to get into the hands of people and the ongoing insecurity is driving that need,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. The spokesperson said that \u201ccivilians and aid workers must be protected; attacks on hospitals, health facilities, ambulances, water services, civilian telecoms services, and IDP shelter locations must stop; and the health, water, and sanitation system must be strengthened in order to avert worse outcomes.\u201d \u201cSince the conflict first began unfolding, USAID has worked relentlessly to increase assistance into Gaza and we will continue to do so,\u201d they said. \u201cThe IPC report \u2026 obviously it confirmed what we all know and what we\u2019ve been dealing with for some time is that the humanitarian situation on the ground is extremely dire. That\u2019s why we have been so incredibly focused on alleviating that situation,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for a ceasefire, obviously, even as we try to get one and we need to do more to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do \u2026 through working to resolve these issues between the government of Israel, the Israeli security forces and the UN humanitarian agencies.\u201d Meanwhile, humanitarian workers are warning that the situation in Gaza is untenable. \u201cIn the north, when we raised the famine alarm, we were able to get some more trucks in. And so for the moment, it is better. Not great \u2014 I don\u2019t want to give false illusions here that this is all hunky dory, because it\u2019s not,\u201d said World Food Programme Director Cindy McCain. \u201cThere\u2019s still great need in the north, and it\u2019s complex. It\u2019s complex for this reason. It\u2019s not just food they need. They need water, they need sanitation, they need health care. All of those things contribute to famine.\u201d A humanitarian official told CNN, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to very rapidly be back on the sort of trajectory that we were seeing in north. The scale will be much larger because it was 300,000 people give or take in northern Gaza. It\u2019s one and a half to 1.8 million people now in the southern middle areas who are in similar boat.\u201d Kate Phillips-Barrasso, of Mercy Corps, added, \u201cThe population cannot endure these hardships any longer. The toll of military action has been far too high, and we fear without dramatic changes to the provision of humanitarian aid, the death toll will climb as people succumb to months of deprivation. \u201cThe humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly, and the specter of famine continues to hang over Gaza,\u201d Phillips-Barrasso told CNN. \u201cDespite some aid getting in, the glaring contradictions remain. Commercial trucks are allowed passage, yet humanitarian aid is limited, scrutinized at the border, and, when permitted to cross, typically only reaches some city centers without proper security.\u201d \u201cCompounding the suffering is oppressive summer heat, no access to clean water, and increasing exposure to garbage and sewage. This lethal equation will undoubtedly lead to acute suffering and mortality,\u201d she said. On Friday, the commissioner-general for the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinia refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, urged the \u201cuninterrupted, regular, coordinated and meaningful flow of humanitarian assistance.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_24_style_vivien-maier-street-photography-new-york", "text": "For much of her life, Vivian Maier was something of a mystery. Her photographic talent went largely unrecognized because she kept her work a secret from most of the people who knew her, including the New York and Chicago families she worked for as a live-in nanny and caregiver. Maier only printed a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of images of bustling city life she snapped with her Rolleiflex and Leica cameras over some five decades, and showed them to almost no one, instead amassing boxes and boxes of negatives and unprocessed film. Her fame came about posthumously, and only because the contents of her Chicago storge lockers were sold off at auction in 2007, after she had stopped paying the rent. \u201cVivian Maier the mystery, the discovery, and the work \u2014 those three parts together are difficult to separate,\u201d said Anne Morin, curator of the touring exhibition \u201cVivian Maier: Unseen Work,\u201d which opened 31 May at Fotografiska New York, the American outpost of the Swedish contemporary photography museum. The show, which runs through 29 September, does not attempt to unravel the puzzle of Maier\u2019s life, however, instead focusing on the work itself, with more than 200 photographs on display, including about 50 vintage prints made by Maier. Morin places her work on the same level as that of renowned street photographers like Robert Frank and Diane Arbus, and worthy of a place in the history of photography. \u201cNobody doubts that,\u201d Morin told CNN. \u201cThe work is strong and Maier had a marvelous eye. And in 10 years, we could do another completely different show \u2014 she has more than enough material to bring to the table.\u201d The exhibition is also a homecoming of sorts for Maier, who was born in New York to a family of French and German immigrants. She started capturing street scenes in the city as a young woman in the 1950s, first borrowing her mother\u2019s Kodak Brownie box camera and then buying her own professional-grade Rollieflex, which she taught herself to use. Her confidence and skill in finding the right moment to snap the shutter is evident even in these early works, in which Maier zeroed in on the unique characters and situations that make up city life: Men snoring open-mouthed on park benches; a balloon from the Central Park Zoo floating to hide a doting father\u2019s face as his baby reaches towards him. But while Maier was known to use commercial studios in New York to have her film processed, she never seems to have made a serious effort to exhibit or sell her work. Maier\u2019s return to New York as a popular icon is \u201ca big thing not only for women, but also for all the artists who are working and are never recognized and never have the opportunity to be seen, to be shared, to exist,\u201d Morin said. \u201cIt is never late to repair history.\u201d New York is \u201cin many ways, the heart of photography history in America,\u201d said Sophie Wright, the museum\u2019s director. \u201cSo it\u2019s amazing now to be in a position to be bringing Vivian back to that world. She\u2019s a rediscovered, important voice of 20th-century photography.\u201d Wright added that Maier\u2019s photographs were taken with \u201cso much thought and care and lack of self-consciousness \u2014 there\u2019s no audience in mind. In a way, it\u2019s pure, artistic expression for her.\u201d Maier\u2019s name and work first captured the public imagination in 2009, the same year she died in Chicago, after the collector and amateur historian John Maloof shared scans of her work on the photo-sharing website Flickr. He was seeking advice on what to do with the thousands of negatives, prints and undeveloped rolls of film he had acquired over the past two years, after stumbling across Maier\u2019s work at the auctions of her storage lockers. Photographers and critics immediately remarked on Maier\u2019s well balanced compositions, and her incisive and often humorous view of the people and places she came across, not just in New York, but also Chicago, where she moved in 1956 and spent most of her adult life, as well as the far flung locations she visited on vacations, from California to Europe and Asia. In 2011, Maloof published a book, \u201cVivian Maier: Street Photographer,\u201d and with the filmmaker Charlie Siskel co-directed the 2013 documentary \u201cFinding Vivian Maier,\u201d which was nominated for an Academy Award. A number of other gallery shows and biographies have also debuted in the years since\u2014 as well as a legal tussle over Maier\u2019s estate, which is now overseen by Chicago\u2019s Cook County Probate Court, and with which Maloof has signed an agreement to display and sell her work. (While Maier did not have any children of her own to inherit her estate, 10 potential heirs in Europe have been found among her extended family, and the court is looking into whether her brother Carl, who died in a psychiatric hospital in 1977, might have had any children.) The public\u2019s appetite for Maier hasn\u2019t diminished, however. When the current exhibition was on display at the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris in 2021, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 213,000 people attended over its four-month run. The opening preview in New York on 30 May had over 600 visitors. Despite her immense popularity, some museums have been slow to accept her work, even those that have major photography collections. Wright attributes this caution over Maier\u2019s work to the fact that she did not make many prints herself. \u201cThere\u2019s a reticence to be seen to be driving a narrative for the work that\u2019s not the artist\u2019s,\u201d\u00a0she explained, as well as a nervousness around the politics of her situation as a woman who was vulnerable in her later years. (At the end of her life, as her hoarding led to her losing caretaking jobs, Maier was believed to have been facing homelessness, until two of her former charges, Lane and Matthew Gensburg, paid for an apartment for her to live in, and later a nursing home.) Maloof and the photography dealer Howard Greenberg, who represents his extensive collection, acknowledge the concerns around posthumous printing of Maier\u2019s work, and during a talk at the exhibition opening, said that led to their decision to only create uncropped, direct reproductions from her negatives. In the show, there are many instances where these later prints are displayed next to the ones Maier made herself, showing how she chose to focus on certain elements in a scene. Maier\u2019s presence can also be felt in the exhibition through audio recordings she made\u00a0 interviewing the children she cared for to encourage their critical thinking, which were also found in her storage lockers. They are played throughout the galleries. But the most persistent reminders of the artist behind these works are the numerous self-portraits she took, often as reflections in mirrored and glass surfaces, or simply as her shadow cast on the ground or a wall. \u201cThe beating heart of the work is the self-representation,\u201d Morin said, and it is these works she sees resonating the most with today\u2019s audiences. \u201cEverybody says, \u2018Oh, my God, Vivian was the godmother of the selfie.\u2019 But it\u2019s different,\u201d the curator continued. Maier\u2019s self-portraits are a stubborn insistence in declaring her independence and identity, at a time when women, and especially domestic workers like her, were ignored and marginalized. \u201cShe wanted to record that,\u201d Morin said, imagining Maier as saying: \u201cI\u2019m here at this moment. No one will erase my face. I exist and I have the proof.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/style/vivien-maier-street-photography-new-york/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_world_julian-assange-plea-deal-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was released from a British prison on Monday and was making his way back to his home country Australia after his 12-year battle against extradition to the United States ended in a plea deal. The controversial figure has spent the past five years in a high-security prison in southeast London and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in the British capital,\u00a0trying to avoid arrest that could have led to life imprisonment. On Monday, Assange, 52, agreed to plead guilty to a single felony charge related to his alleged role in one of the largest US government breaches of classified materials after his whistleblowing website published nearly half a million secret military documents relating to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He officially entered that guilty plea in a court in a remote US territory in the Pacific on Wednesday. The plea deal caps a long-running legal saga, allowing Assange to avoid prison in the US and return to Australia as a free man. Here\u2019s what we know: Where is Assange? Assange boarded a flight from London\u2019s Stansted airport on Monday after being released on bail from prison, according to\u00a0a\u00a0statement\u00a0from WikiLeaks on Tuesday. \u201cJulian Assange is free,\u201d WikiLeaks said. \u201cHe left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of 24 June, after having spent 1,901 days there.\u201d Traveling with Australia\u2019s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Stephen Smith, Assange flew to Saipan, the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific. Under the terms of the agreement, US Justice Department prosecutors will seek a 62-month sentence \u2013 which is equal to the amount of time Assange served in\u00a0the United Kingdom while he fought extradition. The plea deal\u00a0would\u00a0credit that time served, allowing Assange to immediately return to Australia. With Assange resistant to setting foot in the continental US to enter his guilty plea, a judge conducted the hearing and sentencing together on Wednesday in Saipan. The Pacific island chain is a US territory some 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) west of Hawaii and\u00a0a US federal district court is based in the capital Saipan. The islands are also closer to\u00a0Australia, where Assange is a citizen and is expected to return to after the court hearing, prosecutors said. What did Assange do? Assange was wanted by\u00a0US authorities on\u00a0espionage charges\u00a0connected to Wikileaks\u2019 publication of\u00a0hundreds of thousands of sensitive military and government documents supplied by\u00a0former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning\u00a0in 2010 and 2011. The US accused Assange of endangering the lives of confidential sources by releasing the unfiltered cables and had for years been seeking his extradition. He faced 18 charges for his alleged role in the breach and faced a maximum of up to 175 years in prison. British authorities had sought reassurances from the US that he would not receive the death penalty. From Townsville, eastern Queensland, Assange started WikiLeaks in 2006 as an online repository that would publish anonymously submitted material, including the US military\u2019s operating manual for its detention camp in Guantanamo Bay and internal documents from the\u00a0Church of Scientology. In 2010, WikiLeaks was catapulted to global attention when it released video that claimed to show a deadly 2007 US helicopter attack in Iraq. Soon after, WikiLeaks released thousands of classified US military documents relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as a trove of diplomatic cables. Assange described the documents previously to CNN as \u201ccompelling evidence of war crimes\u201d committed by US-led coalition and Iraqi government forces. Fight against extradition Assange had long argued the case against him was politically motivated, that he would not face a fair trial, and his handover would violate the European Convention on Human Rights. Free speech advocates condemned the extradition attempt, saying it would have a chilling effect on press freedom. In August 2010, Assange was accused of sexual assault in Sweden and faced an international arrest warrant. He denied the allegations as \u201ca smear campaign\u201d and refused to go to Stockholm for questioning. He turned himself in to British authorities but while out on bail in 2012 as he appealed extradition to Sweden, Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy requesting political asylum. During his time in the embassy, WikiLeaks kept up its data dumps, including in 2016 when it released thousands of emails apparently hacked from the Democratic National Committee and emails stolen from the private email account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, on the eve of the US election. But over time, his relationship with his host soured and Ecuador\u2019s president came under pressure from the US\u00a0to expel him from the diplomatic bolthole. In 2019, Assange was pulled from the embassy by London\u2019s Metroplitan Police on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department, and spent the next five years living\u00a0mostly isolated, in a 3-by-2-meter cell at Belmarsh prison. The prison has capacity for more than 900 inmates and is known for once housing infamous terror suspects such as the radical Egyptian cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri\u00a0within its high-security unit. Support for Assange\u2019s release There has recently been increased pressure for Assange\u2019s case to be resolved. In May, London\u2019s High Court ruled that Assange\u00a0had the right to appeal in his final challenge against extradition to the US, and US President Joe Biden had alluded to a possible deal pushed by Australian government officials in April. The UN special rapporteur on torture and Amnesty International were among those who called on the United Kingdom to halt the possible extradition, citing concerns over the risk of abuse and other ill-treatment if Assange was sent to the US. Upon his release Monday, Assange\u2019s wife, Stella\u00a0Assange, posted on social media, \u201cJulian is free!\u201d \u201cWords cannot express our immense gratitude to YOU- yes YOU, who have all mobilised for years and years to make this come true,\u201d she wrote. Assange\u2019s mother, Christine Assange, said she is \u201cgrateful that my son\u2019s ordeal is finally coming to an end,\u201d in a statement obtained by CNN on Tuesday. Speaking in parliament, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, \u201cregardless of\u00a0the views that people have about\u00a0Mr. Assange\u2019s activities,\u00a0the case has dragged on for too\u00a0long. There is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia.\u201d Former Ecuadorian president Len\u00edn Moreno told CNN he is glad the WikiLeaks founder won\u2019t be handed over to the US. Moreno withdrew\u00a0Assange\u2019s asylum in April 2019, which had\u00a0allowed him to stay at the South American country\u2019s embassy in London. Among those celebrating Assange\u2019s release were the presidents of Colombia and Mexico. \u201cAssange\u2019s eternal imprisonment and torture was an attack on press freedom on a global scale,\u201d said Colombian President Gustavo Petro.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned. His office declined to give details, saying an official announcement was being prepared", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/style/fumihiko-maki-architect-dies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_americas_boluarte-allegations-icc-crimes-against-humanity-intl-latam", "text": "Two human rights groups have made a submission to the International Criminal Court accusing Peru\u2019s President Dina Boluarte and members of her government of crimes against humanity in connection with the deaths of 49 people during the Andean country\u2019s weeks-long protest movement in 2022 and 2023. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and Peru\u2019s Association for Human Rights (APRODEH) submitted a communication to the ICC Tuesday, asking it to open a preliminary examination against Boluarte and members of her government regarding the allegations. According to the ICC, submitting a communication is the first step for it to establish if, based on available information, it appears that crimes within its jurisdiction have been committed. If it decides this is so, the court can proceed to\u00a0open a full preliminary examination. Lawyers Jimena Reyes, director of the Americas desk at FIDH, and Gloria Cano, director of APRODEH, met members of the Prosecutor\u2019s office on Tuesday and submitted documentation alleging crimes against humanity took place between December 7, 2022 and February 9, 2023, a statement released by the FIDH says. \u201cThe persons implicated in the commission of the crimes of murder and attempted murder were state authorities, including members of the Peruvian Army and the Peruvian National Police, who acted in accordance with a state policy planned or, at a minimum, approved by omission, by the highest national authorities of\u00a0Peru,\u201d\u00a0a report issued by FIDH and Aprodeh concludes. The victims \u201cwere part of a civilian population of protesters or persons perceived as such, mainly young, poor men from indigenous areas of the country\u201d the report added. CNN has reached out to the Peruvian government and the attorney representing Boluarte for comment. President Boluarte has denied any personal responsibility since the protests started while former Prime Minister Alberto Otarola said the government defended \u201cPeruvians\u2019 right to peace and calm\u201d. Apart from the victims, there were also hundreds of people injured \u201cas a result of the indiscriminate use of lethal force by the military and by the police who were in charge of patrolling the demonstrations after the declaration of a state of\u00a0emergency,\u201d\u00a0Cano told CNN. \u201cThe majority were killed while exercising their legitimate right to protest,\u201d Cano said. The victim profiles submitted to the ICC include 32-year-old Leonardo\u00a0Hancco\u00a0and 18-year-old\u00a0Beckhan Quispe, whose cases have been previously reported by CNN. Allegations of \u2018extrajudicial executions\u2019 The Andean country\u2019s weeks-long protest movement was sparked by the impeachment and arrest of former President Pedro Castillo in December 2022, fuelled by deep dissatisfaction over living conditions and inequality in the country. While protests occurred throughout the nation, the worst violence was in the rural and indigenous south. An\u00a0Amnesty International report in May 2023\u00a0found that Peruvian\u00a0security forces\u00a0carried out widespread attacks against protesters including young men and children. The report alleges the security forces took part in\u00a0\u201cextrajudicial executions \u201cand \u201cwidespread use of lethal ammunition\u201d while trying to contain the protests. Forty-nine civilians were killed,\u00a0and Amnesty International says that several of those killed were bystanders. \u201cIn none of the cases was evidence found that the deceased person posed a risk to the life or integrity of the officials,\u201d the Amnesty International report says. Peru\u2019s Prosecutor\u2019s office opened a preliminary investigation in\u00a0January 2023\u00a0against Boluarte, Otarola, and other ministers at the time for alleged genocide, homicide and serious injuries committed during the protests. Boluarte testified at a closed-door meeting last year\u00a0CNN en Espanol reported. This investigation remains open. Peru\u2019s defense and interior ministries had also been contacted for comment. Both ministries told CNN in February 2023 they could not comment until an ongoing investigation carried out by the Prosecutor\u2019s office is finished. Peruvian authorities have said that the country\u2019s security forces acted in self-defense. Last year Boluarte said that she and her ministers do not decide protocols for the Armed Forces or the Police. \u201cThey have their own law and protocols. Who do they comply with? Their commanders. We don\u2019t have any power over them. I can be the Supreme Chief of the Armed Forces, but I have no command (over them) and the protocols are decided by them,\u201d\u00a0she said. Yovana Mendoza, president of the victim\u2019s association in Ayacucho and who lost her 34-year-old brother\u00a0Jhon Mendoza, told CNN this request to the ICC\u2019s is a cry for help from the families in Peru.\u00a0She says\u00a0they have been forgotten and ignored by the authorities there. \u201cHere we don\u2019t trust the government, as they only introduce laws to protect\u00a0themselves,\u201d\u00a0she said. Ruth Barcena told CNN she is hopeful for justice with this request after the death of her husband Leonardo Hancco.

{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_ukraine-moldova-eu-talks-intl", "text": "Formal negotiations between Ukraine and Moldova on joining the European Union begin on Tuesday, a landmark moment for the two former Soviet-bloc countries that marks the start of a long, drawn-out process. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X:\u00a0 \u201cCongratulations to Moldova and Ukraine on opening accession negotiations. This is very good news for the people of Ukraine, Moldova, and the entire European Union. The path ahead will be challenging but full of opportunities.\u201d The two nations first applied to join the EU in 2022, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the bloc has been broadly supportive of Ukraine and sent over $100 billion, according to EU figures, the path to joining the EU for either country will  be far from smooth. Hungary, Russia\u2019s main ally within the EU, has dragged its feet on a number of issues concerning Ukraine, including military and financial aid. In December of last year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he would block Kyiv\u2019s bid to begin accession talks. He eventually dropped his objections, however, Orban will still have plenty of opportunities to frustrate Ukraine. The path to EU membership requires candidate to meet a set of criteria before entering into detailed chapters of negotiation \u2013 known as the chapters of the acquis \u2013 covering a range of issues, from economic standards to rule of law. There are 35 chapters in total, all of which must be agreed by all negotiating parties, including the 27 EU member states. The process of opening, negotiating and closing all 35 chapters is expected to take over a decade for both Moldova and Ukraine. Further to this, neither country has yet to meet the criteria to even reach this stage of the negotiations. Meeting the criteria is particularly complicated for Ukraine, as it is virtually impossible to meet the standards required while under invasion and at war. Moldova, too has domestic difficulties, with the self-declared Moldovan independent state of Transnistria seeking alliance with Russia while the rest of the country turns to Europe. Transnistria is internationally still recognized as part of Moldova, but it is not implausible that some will see this as a reason the country cannot join the EU while the matter is unresolved. Practical and technical negations aside, there is also a political dimension to this that is likely to complicate negations. Expanding the bloc to the east of Europe will have consequences for the rest of the EU member states. It is likely both Ukraine and Moldova will be net recipients of the EU budget. That makes it a harder sell for all the existing EU nations, as their spending will go up and their overall share of the budget will fall. There will also be implications for industry. Ukraine, for example, has already run into trouble with European partners over its agricultural industry. Poland, one of the most consistent supporters of Ukraine in its war effort, temporarily banned Ukraine from exporting grain into the country because it was harming Polish farmers. The spat escalated, with Poland suspending its military support for Ukraine. Perhaps more importantly, accepting Ukraine and Moldova to the bloc would mean adding around 40 million new EU citizens from Eastern Europe. This means giving freedom of movement within the bloc to many people who might want to escape what has recently been a war zone. It would also shift the balance of power within the EU further to the east. While there are no hard and fast rules about which member states align on which issues, it is broadly reasonable to say that the eastern countries have different political views to southern and Western European countries. That could mean some existing EU member states will slow down and frustrate the process unless certain safeguards are put in place protecting their own privileged positions within the bloc. The start of negotiations is a big moment for those hoping to join the bloc to they can move further away from Russian influence and into the EU yolk. But in reality, these opening talks are mostly symbolic and there is still a long way to go before either country becomes a full member state.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/ukraine-moldova-eu-talks-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

A Chinese woman school bus attendant was also critically injured in the attack in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, an official with the Japanese Nationals Overseas Safety Division of Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry told CNN. The mother and child did not suffer life-threatening injuries and were taken to hospital to receive care, the official said. The Japanese consulate in nearby Shanghai said \u201ca man, possibly Chinese\u201d attacked the mother and her child with a knife. In a statement Tuesday, police in Suzhou said they arrested an unemployed 52-year-old suspect at the scene, identified by his surname Zhou. A Chinese national who tried to stop the knife attack was critically injured and was still fighting for their life, police said. One of the injured Japanese nationals had been discharged from hospital, police added. \u201cThe investigation of the case is ongoing, and the criminal behavior will be severely punished in accordance with the law and regulations,\u201d the statement said. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Tuesday expressed regret over the stabbing and vowed to take effective measures to protect foreigners\u2019 safety in the country. \u201cSuch isolated incidents may happen in any country in the world,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular news briefing. Attacks against foreigners are rare in China,\u00a0but Monday\u2019s stabbing is the second such incident this month in the powerful security state, after four instructors from a US college were stabbed by a Chinese man at a park in the northeastern city of Jilin. A Chinese tourist who tried to intervene in that June 10 attack was also stabbed, but no one suffered life-threatening injuries, according to police. The 55-year-old suspect in the Jilin attack was arrested but police have not revealed his motive. In Suzhou, the attack took place Monday afternoon as the mother waited to pick up her child at a bus stop near a Japanese school, according to the Japanese official. A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy in Beijing told CNN the Japanese mother is in her 30s and her injured son is pre-school age. Two buses were at the bus stop at the time of the attack, a woman who was at the scene waiting to pick up her son told Japanese public broadcaster NHK. She said she heard shouting near one of the buses then saw a man, who appeared to be in his 50s or 60s, grab a boy and\u00a0swing toward him while holding knife, NHK reported. The school bus is from the Suzhou Japanese School, located less than a mile from the bus stop in an area where many Japanese nationals live,\u00a0NHK said. The region hosts many manufacturing plants for Japanese companies. The bus attendant and parents at the scene subdued the attacker using an umbrella and a bag, according to NHK. Knife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled. The country has faced a spate of stabbing rampages in public places in recent years, including schools and hospitals. \u201cRecently, stabbings have been reported in public places (parks, schools, subways, etc.) throughout China,\u201d the Japanese consulate in Shanghai said in a statement, urging Japanese nationals in the country to be aware of their surroundings in a warning echoed by Japan\u2019s Embassy in Beijing. The attack was initially censored on Chinese social media, with search results for \u201cJapanese school\u201d on X-like platform Weibo heavily filtered to allow only posts from official accounts on Tuesday morning. By Tuesday afternoon, the censorship appeared to have relaxed after China\u2019s Foreign Ministry commented on the incident. China\u2019s strictly censored social media platforms have seen\u00a0a rise in ultra-nationalism and anti-Japanese sentiment in recent years. Rooted in Japan\u2019s brutal invasion of China during World War II, Chinese public sentiment against Japan has waxed and waned \u2013 often tied to China\u2019s domestic politics and the state of bilateral ties. But as Chinese nationalism turns more aggressive and intolerant under the leadership of Xi Jinping, Japanese schools in China have faced growing criticism and suspicion. In recent months, some online posts and videos have called for Japanese schools to be shut down in China, while others accused the schools of being breeding ground for spies. Opened in 2005, the Suzhou Japanese School offers six-year elementary school and three-year junior high school curriculums, according to its website. Its rules state that students must be picked up by a parent or guardian from the school bus. The school was closed Tuesday following the attack, and security has been stepped up at other Japanese schools across China, NHK reported.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/china/japanese-mother-child-stabbed-china-bus-stop-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

They had walked for five hours to get here, and had been waiting all day. But they looked at us \u2013 and the\u00a0tribal dignitaries\u00a0on whose land they were trespassing \u2013 with only mild curiosity.\u00a0They were asylum seekers, looking for the green uniforms of US Border Patrol so that they could turn themselves in. Chairman Verlon Jose, leader of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, considered addressing them, and then turned away. \u201cThis is nothing that the nation can solve,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever I say to them is not even going to be relevant, other than our prayers for their journey.\u201d The Tohono O\u2019odham, or \u201cpeople of the desert,\u201d have lived in the Sonoran desert for thousands of years, their\u00a0ancestral\u00a0homelands stretching from what is now Pima County, Arizona, all the way to Mexico\u2019s Sea of Cortez. The\u00a0US-Mexico border now slices across those lands, a 62-mile line of low metal fencing weaves between ancient saguaro cacti and\u00a0that\u00a0marks the southern limit of the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0federal Indian reservation\u00a0\u2013 and the edge of the United States. The Tohono O\u2019odham do not recognize this border; enrolled members speak their own language, live on both sides and travel back and forth. But it has become impossible to ignore amid\u00a0record numbers of migrants crossing into the US from Mexico\u00a0and a bitter political storm over what to do with them. You could drive for miles on the sprawling Tohono O\u2019odham reservation without encountering anyone beside the free-ranging cattle. But for decades, migrants and asylum seekers, northbound drug smugglers and southbound arms traffickers, and US Border Patrol agents have roamed here in endless pursuit across the rocky terrain. The toll of all this traffic on the environment is obvious; discarded clothes, trash, diapers and even ID cards line the border. In December, during the peak of recent border crossings, thousands of asylum seekers camped out on\u00a0the Nation\u2019s territory, burning the reservation\u2019s wild mesquite trees for warmth as they waited to be apprehended. The sight of the broken branches, piles of abandoned plastic bottles and human waste left in the migrants\u2019 wake was heartbreaking to the tribe, Jose told CNN. \u201cYour heart feels for the migrants and so forth like that\u2026 but then other part says look at the destruction that they\u2019re causing us\u2026 look at the trash that they\u2019re leaving,\u201d Jose told CNN. The chairman and Arizona governor Katie Hobbs\u00a0wrote in a joint letter to the federal government last year requesting ramped up staffing and resources from the US Customs and Border\u00a0Protection (CBP)\u00a0to deal with the surge. But the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0longstanding reliance on the federal government to enforce the border means an uneasy trade of tribal sovereignty for security. Border\u00a0police have had violent run-ins with members, and the thought of a potential border wall is seen as a travesty here \u2013 a mutilation of the land itself. \u201cAll we want is safe passage to our traditional homes, to our sacred areas. The drug activity, the migrant activity is going to go on and go on. And we\u2019re caught in the middle of this,\u201d Jose said. Strangers in the desert The Tohono O\u2019odham reservation\u00a0is part of Arizona\u2019s Tucson sector and\u00a0one of the busiest immigration sectors in the country in both apprehensions of border crossers and marijuana seizures, according to the Customs and Border\u00a0Protection\u00a0website. Across the sprawling reservation, the tribe works closely with CBP, providing land for checkpoints, forward operating bases, surveillance infrastructure, and putting forward indigenous-led special units that investigate and track drug smuggling. The\u00a0Nation says that it spends an average of $3 million annually to assist with border security. Still, strangers walk onto the reservation all the time. In the small southern community of\u00a0Menagers\u00a0Dam, just a 15 minute walk from the border, people turn up asking for water or a phone, others march straight into homes to raid their kitchens, said Annette Mattia, 61, who lives in the village. Some\u00a0Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0members put out water or food for the migrants, others are afraid to. Some members have been involved in smuggling themselves, she says. \u201cWe\u2019re always calling (Border Patrol) because where we live is a bushy area with the trees still there and everything. And that was like the gateway for smugglers. You can just go walk in our yard and in the little trees, and you\u2019ll find the slipper shoes the smugglers use, or their camouflage clothes,\u201d she says. Still, seeing Border Patrol\u2019s trucks and helicopters on the reservation and frequent questioning by agents also makes many\u00a0of the Nation\u2019s residents\u00a0bristle. \u201cIf you decide to go out into the mountains for the day, if you want to pick the cactus fruit or get materials from the desert, Border Patrol will be out there, and they will be on you: \u2018What are you doing here, why are you out here?\u2019,\u201d Annette Mattia told CNN. \u201cYou know, this is our reservation. It\u2019s our nation. We can go hunting if we want to go hunting, we can gather if we want to gather,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re here because the border\u2019s here.\u201d A deadly landscape Sprawling across 2.8\u00a0million acres, it\u2019s easy to imagine getting lost in this desert reservation. Massive rock formations are the only landmarks, rising between low plains dotted with dry shrubs and cactus forests. Many migrants who cross here never make it out alive; the remains of at least 1,650 people have been found across the Tohono O\u2019odham reservation since 2000, according to local organization Humane Borders, which\u00a0works with the Pima County Medical Examiner\u2019s office to track deaths. Last year, the bodies of 81 people were found on the reservation, according to Humane Borders. So far in 2024, 10 bodies have been found here, according to the Humane Borders map, all discovered on the San Miguel corridor \u2013 the same route where we met dozens of people waiting with children as young as toddlers. Most, but not all, are reduced to skeletons in the arid desert. In May, one unidentified man found close to the border was found \u201cfully fleshed\u201d \u2013 he had\u00a0died from heat exposure within a day of being found, according to the county medical examiner\u2019s report. In February, the body of a 22-year-old woman was found on the Baboquivari Peak\u00a0mountain range; she was the victim of blunt force injuries, the medical examiner assessed. Summer is the deadliest time for border crossings. But while migration through the Sonoran Desert has historically slowed during these searing months, that\u2019s no longer the case today, a CBP spokesperson told CNN; human traffickers who\u2019ve made a business of promising asylum in America now push migrants through the border year-round in order to maximize profits. Demand for traffickers is high, despite the risks \u2013 which migrants may not always understand. Since the pandemic, people fleeing stuttering economies, climate change, crime and authoritarian governments have flocked to the US southern border, a CBP spokesperson told CNN \u2013 nearly all those journeys were facilitated by criminal groups. \u201cNo one crosses on their own anymore,\u201d the spokesperson told CNN. Cartels\u2019 grip on the border area is near-complete, he confirmed; attempting to cross the Mexican side of the desert into the US without paying is another way to end up dead. Migrants sent one way, drugs another Today, faced with vast numbers of asylum seekers in a blistering landscape, the day-to-day work of Border Patrol often ends up being humanitarian. In the Tucson Sector, Border Patrol agents perform dozens of rescues each week, according to statistics posted online by the agency, and frequently end up treating dehydrated or injured migrants in the desert. Even more often, agents simply ferry families from the desolate border where asylum seekers politely wait to be apprehended, to detention centers further inland \u2013 a task that one agent likened with annoyance to babysitting or Uber driving. Some describe with nostalgia a Wild West version of their jobs from decades past, chasing drug runners across a dramatic landscape. \u201cBack in the day when it was just single males with a lot of narcotics, it was dangerous but kind of exciting,\u201d said the agent, who requested anonymity because he did not have permission to speak publicly. \u201cSecure the border. We didn\u2019t have to babysit. We were up in the mountains getting narcotics and stuff, chasing gun traffickers, drugs. But now it\u2019s moms and infants. It sucks. Nobody wants to deal with a mama and baby.\u201d Border Patrol agents and Nation\u00a0members say migrants, on whom so much national attention is focused, are often used as a distraction for law enforcement on the reservation. Cartels funnel large groups toward remote areas that are difficult and time-consuming to reach, in addition to being more dangerous for the travelers, while smugglers trek with drug-loaded backpacks\u00a0up another route. \u201cThe cartels want migrants to cross in rural areas to pull us away, so drugs and stuff can make it through while we\u2019re busy\u2026 You\u2019ve got to drive the freaking 30 or 40 minutes out there, pick them up, drive 30 or 40 minutes back. You ain\u2019t got time to go chase three or four people with backpacks walking through the desert,\u201d the agent told CNN. Urban crossing areas are also often more closely patrolled than the desert wilds and are more likely to be blocked by a towering steel barrier, unlike these lands. Mike Wilson, a Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0member who has gained celebrity in human rights circles for years spent putting out water for migrants on the reservation, says many of the deaths on the reservation were predictable. In a recently published memoir, \u201cWhat Side Are You On?\u201d Wilson blames a US border policy of deterrence \u2013 blocking irregular migration at urban crossing points \u2013 for driving asylum seekers into Tohono O\u2019odham lands and the most perilous parts of the desert. The strategy, which originated in the 1990s, included a calculation that deaths resulting from the dangerous trek would deter future migrants. The number of illegal border crossings has risen since then. Security vs. sovereignty Frustrations over the border here came to a head last year, when Annette\u2019s brother Raymond Mattia was shot and killed by a group of Border Patrol agents at his home. Nothing to do with immigration \u2013 they\u00a0were supposed to be backing up a local Tohono O\u2019odham police unit\u00a0that was looking into a 911 call reporting two gunshots had been heard. Footage from\u00a0the agents\u2019 body cameras\u00a0showed their flashlights casting through the dark of the Arizona desert, choppily illuminating saguaro cacti and low shrubs in the neighborhood in search of movement in the area, before noticing the unarmed 58-year-old \u00a0standing in his front yard. Obeying agents\u2019 orders, he removed his hand from his pocket, withdrawing a cell phone. They began firing immediately. \u201cI thought they were yelling and shouting at illegals,\u201d she recalled, describing their attitude as a \u201chyped up and ready to hunt.\u201d \u201cThey had flashlights going like crazy, shouting, yelling at each other, and I was like, \u2018What the heck is going on?\u2019 Then I realized they were going to Ray\u2019s house.\u201d It is unclear if Raymond Mattia was the person they were looking for; authorities made no allegations following the incident. The US Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona has chosen not to press charges over the killing, prompting the Mattia family to launch a wrongful death lawsuit. But holding border agents to account has been\u00a0increasingly hard to do following\u00a0a 2022 Supreme Court ruling\u00a0that gave federal agents broad legal protection against claims of excessive force. \u201cI know they\u2019re here to protect the border: for the terrorists, the immigrants, the smugglers. But when they\u2019re coming to the reservation to shoot a Native American person who is at home, they should be accountable for that kind of action,\u201d Annette Mattia said. In a statement last year criticizing the US Attorney\u2019s decision not to prosecute, Jose linked Mattia\u2019s death to a larger failing of border management. \u201cThe US government\u2019s refusal to enact sensible border solutions has brought undue hardship to O\u2019odham and other border communities,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile politicians waste time debating walls and other ineffective and divisive ideas, our people are persecuted\u00a0and in this case, killed by federal agents.\u201d The chairman sees the federal approach toward the border as all too focused on maintaining an imaginary line and scoring political points, and expressed frustration\u00a0with the failure of Congress to find a bigger-picture, bipartisan solution\u00a0\u2013 something that in recent weeks has led the Biden administration to rely on executive orders instead. \u201cWhy would we want to protect a border? We want to protect the environment. We want to protect the people. We want to protect the communities around here,\u201d\u00a0Jose said. That\u2019s his mandate from Nation\u00a0elders, he said. What the US should do, he said, is focus on \u201ckicking its drug habit\u201d to shrink demand for smuggled narcotics, and widen sustainable immigration pathways for economic migrants that allow them to come, work and eventually leave. Still, as long as migrants keep coming here, so will Border Patrol \u2013 and the tribal government has been clear that it wants the federal agency to handle the immediate crisis. New buildings designed to serve as sleeping and living quarters for Border Patrol agents are currently being built on the reservation. Standing on the border halfway up a mountain, where the low posts that mark the border stop, and the rocks and dry shrubs flow seamlessly between the US and Mexico, Jose was clear on his own red line: While much is out of the Nation\u2019s\u00a0hands, he will resist any kind of border wall \u2013 a prospect that has haunted the nation since the Trump administration, and which looms again with the former President\u2019s reelection bid. From his view, the very first migrant surge started at Plymouth Rock. \u201cIf ever there was a time to build a wall,\u201d he said, \u201cit would have been 500 years ago.\u201d Edited by CNN\u2019s Rachel Clarke in Atlanta.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/americas/migration-us-mexico-border-tohono-oodham-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_europe_russia-dagestan-attacks-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Russia is reeling from another major terror attack, with at least 19 people killed and 25 injured in what appeared to be coordinated shootings at various places of worship in Russia\u2019s southernmost Dagestan republic. The attack is the second in the last three months after more than 130 people were killed at a concert hall near Moscow in a terrorist attack claimed by ISIS-K in March, and challenges President Vladimir Putin\u2019s self-declared reputation as a leader able to guarantee order across the vast, turbulent country. The uptick in violence comes as long-simmering ethnic tensions resurface, compounded both by drives to fill Russia\u2019s military ranks as Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine grinds on \u2013 and by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What happened in Dagestan? Gunmen opened fire at multiple places of worship and a police traffic stop in two cities in Muslim majority Dagestan, killing at least 15 police officers and four civilians including a priest on Sunday. Two synagogues\u00a0\u2013 one in the city of Derbent and one in the city of Makhachkala \u2013 were attacked, according to a statement from the Russian Jewish Congress (RJC). Attackers \u201cset the building on fire using Molotov cocktails\u201d at the synagogue in Derbent while police and security guards were killed outside during the attack, the RJC. In the provincial capital Makhachkala, Russian state-news agency TASS reported that a church security guard was killed in a shootout at Svyato-Uspenskiy Sobor, and 19 people had locked themselves inside the premises amid an attack.\u00a0 An attack was also reported at a police traffic post in Makhachkala. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but law enforcement agencies told TASS that the attackers were \u201cadherents of an international terrorist organization.\u201d The Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the Republic of Dagestan said it had launched a terror investigation into the attacks under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. TASS reported Monday that five of the gunmen had been identified and that some of them were related to the leader of the Sergokalinsky district, which lies between Derbent and Makhachkala. It identified one of the men as former mixed martial arts fighter Gadzhimurad Kagirov. Kagirov had taken part in the attack on Derbent and was also a cousin of the head of the Sergokalinsky district, Magomed Omarov, it claimed. Omarov\u2019s son and nephew were also among the attackers, authorities alleged. Where is Dagestan? Dagestan lies in Russia\u2019s Caucasus region on the western shores of the Caspian Sea. The republic is in many ways a microcosm of Russia\u2019s diversity. The mountainous region is home to over 30 ethnic groups with distinct languages and it is a\u00a0majority Muslim\u00a0republic\u00a0that has historically been home to a variety of Islamic religious practices. It has a miniscule Jewish population \u2013 Judaism is one of Dagestan\u2019s long-established religions, practiced by\u00a0communities of the Mountain Jews, who speak a form of Persian \u2013 but after centuries of coexistence with Muslim neighbors, that population has\u00a0dwindled through emigration. The Caucasus were mostly subsumed into the Russian empire in the nineteenth century had a long history of resentment towards rule by Moscow, during Tsarist, Soviet and post-Soviet times. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, insurgents in neighboring Chechnya fought two separatist wars for independence \u2013 which Russia labeled terrorism and responded with tactics that left much of the capital Grozny in ruins. Putin then installed feared warlord Ramzan Kadyrov in Chechnya who has since ruled with an iron fist. In Dagestan, Russian security forces fought an\u00a0Islamist insurgency\u00a0in the mountainous region in the 2000s that spilled over from neighboring Chechnya, though attacks have become rarer in recent years. But contemporary events have put the historically restless region once more on edge. Religious and ethnic tensions in Russia Over 200 ethnic minority communities live in Russia, which spans eleven time zones and is home to some 144 million people. Some of these communities have been hit especially hard by Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine with ethnic minorities disproportionately mobilized to face the horror of Moscow\u2019s human wave tactics. Protests broke out in multiple ethnic minority regions in 2022 against Putin\u2019s mobilization orders, including in Dagestan. In one video CNN geolocated from the time, women in the capital Makhachkala could be seen pleading with police outside a theater. \u201cWhy are you taking our children? Who attacked who? It\u2019s Russia that attacked Ukraine,\u201d they could be heard saying in the video. Israel\u2019s war against Hamas following the brutal October 7 attacks has also sent tensions soaring across the world, fueled by daily images of the destruction in Gaza, including in the Caucasus. Putin has played a delicate international balancing act, putting himself forward as a potential mediator and calling for restraint on both sides \u2013 a position that has\u00a0won praise from Hamas. But that confidence was shaken later that month when antisemitic rioters stormed Dagestan\u2019s Makhachkala Uytash Airport where a flight from Israel arrived. At\u00a0least 20 people were injured and 60 people were detained in the chaotic clashes, according to local authorities.  Multiple videos on social media showed a crowd of people inside the airport and on the runway, some waving the Palestinian flag, others forcing their way through closed doors in the international terminal. Interreligious violence is something that Russian leader Putin is \u201cvery, very worried\u201d about, said former CNN Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty in response to Sunday\u2019s attacks in Dagestan. Russia has a complex web of relationships in the Middle East: Putin backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (an enemy of Israel);\u00a0he relies on Iran\u00a0(another enemy of Israel) for a stockpile of drones to attack Ukraine; and he\u2019s a\u00a0high-fiving friend\u00a0of\u00a0Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, another power player in the region. He has also maintained cordial working relationships with Israeli counterparts, although\u00a0his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cooled. ISIS-K attack on music venue The coordinated attacks in Dagestan come just weeks after Russia suffered its worst terror attack in decades. In March, over 130 people were killed after assailants stormed a popular concert venue complex on the outskirts of Moscow. ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the massacre and four gunmen from the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan were charged with terrorism. The shocking terror attack came just a week after Putin won a stage-managed election which tightened his grip on the country he has ruled since the turn of the century. For a leader who has long promised security and stability to Russians, the major attack on Russian soil was another powerful blow. The emotion unleashed by the rampage \u2013 combined with the disturbing videos \u2013 unleashed a wave of xenophobia from some towards Central Asian migrant workers in general. Migrants from the former Soviet Union\u2019s Central Asian states \u2014 Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan \u2014 have traditionally been a valuable source of cheap labor in Russia. In the aftermath of the March attack, Putin called for Russia to remain united. \u201cWe must never forget that we are a multinational, multi-religious country. We must always treat our brothers, representatives of other faiths with respect, as we always do \u2014 Muslims, Jews, everyone,\u201d he said. But Sunday\u2019s attack in Dagestan shows deep fissures continue to pockmark Russia\u2019s border regions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/europe/russia-dagestan-attacks-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd", "text": "Pollsters were surprised by the burst of populism in 2016, but many now think they shouldn\u2019t have been. In the United States and United Kingdom, swaths of voters in deprived regions \u2013 places \u201cleft behind\u201d by globalization \u2013 were given the chance to stick it to the system, and they took it. Why was anyone surprised? Pollsters have now been surprised by another trend. In this month\u2019s European Parliament elections, far-right parties performed predictably well \u2013 but especially, and unexpectedly, among young people. A few years ago, \u201cGeneration Climate\u201d \u2013 thought to be unquestionably liberal and progressive \u2013 were voting mostly green. But now, their vote has helped far-right parties capture one in four seats in Brussels. What happened? Perhaps the \u201cleft behind\u201d is not only a geographical phenomenon, but generational. Gen-Z - those born between 1995 and 2012 - has been baptized in crises: first the financial, then the eurozone, then of the pandemic and now of war in Europe. More and more young people believe they will have harder lives than their parents. Why should a left-behind generation be less vulnerable to the lure of populism than left-behind places? Roberto Foa, co-director of the Centre for the Future of Democracy at the University of Cambridge, a leading researcher of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, sees \u201ctwo big divides\u201d in Western societies: \u201cThe wealth divide between economically successful and left-behind regions, and the intergenerational divide in life opportunities.\u201d Political scientists may have overlooked both cohorts because they have long been disconnected. But now their apathy is turning into antipathy \u2013 a desire, once more, to stick it to the system. \u201cIf you are a political entrepreneur who is seeking to break the established party system, those are your options, in terms of mobilizing fresh support,\u201d Foa told CNN. The trend, he says, has been a long time coming: \u201cI\u2019m surprised that people are surprised.\u201d Youth support for far-right parties is being felt in several European countries. In Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), won 16% of the under-25 vote in the EU elections \u2013 tripling its share in that demographic from the previous vote in 2019. Among French voters under 34, the National Rally (RN) was the most popular party, with 32% of the vote \u2013 a 10-point rise compared to 2019. In Poland, 30% of under-30 voters supported the far-right Confederation party, up from 18.5% in 2019. Far-right parties enjoyed a similar uptick in support in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria, and continued to do well in Italy. How alarmed \u2013 and surprised \u2013 should mainstream parties be? Generation, not geography Consider these policy proposals. Young people will pay no income tax. If they start a business, they will be exempt from corporation tax for five years. Students working part-time will have their wages topped up by the state, which will also build 100,000 units of student housing. They can also travel by train for free. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking this must be the platform of the far left. But no: This was RN doyenne Marine Le Pen\u2019s offer in the 2022 French presidential election, which she narrowly lost. Young people, unsurprisingly, loved it. Just under 50% of 25-to-34-year-olds who cast a vote opted for Le Pen, compared to just 41% of the general population and 29% of voters over 70. Whereas the \u201cgray vote\u201d took Donald Trump to the White House and Britain from the EU, it kept the French far right at bay. That may soon change. After his Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right in the EU elections, President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election, which could result in Jordan Bardella, the RN\u2019s 28-year-old leader, becoming France\u2019s prime minister next month. For Arthur Prevot, manager of the RN\u2019s youth wing in Paris, this is great news. Macron\u2019s presidency has failed to deliver for young people, he says. \u201cPurchasing power has decreased incredibly over the past seven years. Between the \u2018gilets jaunes\u2019 crisis, the rise in fuel prices, and all the different taxes that have been introduced \u2013 all of this impacts daily life, including mine,\u201d Prevot, 22, told CNN. His economic concerns prompted him to join the party which may soon govern France, although Macron will remain president. Jonathan Verbeken, a deputy RN candidate in Paris\u2019 15th district, said the main reason he joined the party was because, \u201cwe see people suffering daily, struggling to make ends meet. We see a deplorable situation in France, specifically with security and immigration. We want to react to that.\u201d To many older voters, the RN remains a terrifying prospect. Despite its years-long effort to \u201cnormalize,\u201d previous generations remember its antisemitic, neofascist origins. But young voters appear less concerned by these roots, says Simon Schnetzer, author of a recent survey of Germany\u2019s youth. \u201cYoung people are first-time voters. They are a blank sheet. What drives their decisions most is: Who can offer me something that best fits my needs?\u201d he told CNN. The lack of historical baggage, coupled with the strange death of center-left parties in many parts of Europe, has allowed the far right to appear respectable and armed with economic solutions to young people\u2019s problems. Sarah-Lee Heinrichs, a 23-year-old politician for the German Green Party, said economic concerns have become far more prevalent among young people since the last European Parliament elections in 2019, when the Greens became the second largest party in Germany for the first time. In the wake of the pandemic, the full-scale war in Ukraine and the return of soaring inflation, environmentalism is no longer young people\u2019s priority, she says. \u201cIf governments don\u2019t provide social security \u2013 good jobs and a place to live that doesn\u2019t cost more than 50% of your income every month \u2013 then the far-right will rise,\u201d Heinrichs told CNN. And with economic insecurity is coming fiercer opposition to immigration, nearly a decade after the continent \u2013 and especially Germany - welcomed a record number of refugees fleeing war in Syria. An alarming new trend began last month, after a short clip filmed on the German vacation island of Sylt was posted on X. In the video, well-dressed German youths belt out \u201cAusl\u00e4nder Raus!\u201d (\u201cforeigners out!\u201d) and \u201cDeutschland den Deutschen!\u201d (\u201cGermany for Germans!\u201d) over a 1999 Eurodance beat. The chant has since swirled across the country, currently hosting the European soccer championships. Its appeal is not confined to Germans. As Italy played Spain last week, fans in the stadium could be heard giving their own rendition. Swiping right If that\u2019s the \u201cdemand\u201d side, what about the supply? After her center-right bloc secured the most seats in the European Parliament, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen took to the stage in Brussels to give a victory speech. But her tone was more somber than victorious. She spoke of the importance of defending European values: integration, democracy and the rule of law. How do these abstract values sound to young voters? \u201cYoung people will double check, does that help me with any of my needs? Does it entertain me? Does it give me security? Is it fun? And if it\u2019s none of that, it\u2019s boring,\u201d said Schnetzer. \u201cIf you have this TikTok logic, you\u2019ll quickly swipe further.\u201d While Europe\u2019s mainstream gives grave speeches, the far right is developing vast followings on social media platform TikTok. The RN\u2019s clean-shaven Bardella posts videos of himself wine tasting and doing shots. Maximilian Krah, the AfD\u2019s lead candidate going into\u00a0the EU elections, offers his followers dating advice: \u201cDon\u2019t watch porn, don\u2019t vote for the Greens.\u201d In one TikTok, Nigel Farage \u2013 often described as the \u201carchitect\u201d of Brexit \u2013 approaches a fruit store, says \u201clovely melons,\u201d raises his eyebrows and walks off. The clip has been viewed 2.5 million times. Farage seems aware of this burgeoning market and keen to exploit it. In a recent interview, he praised misogynist online influencer Andrew Tate for being an \u201cimportant voice\u201d for \u201cemasculated\u201d young boys. Tate \u2013 who has racked up billions of views on TikTok \u2013 is facing charges in Romania of human trafficking and rape, which he denies. But those who have puzzled over Tate\u2019s appeal to young men should not be surprised that politicians making jokes about breasts enjoy similar success. The distinction between politicians and entertainment has long grown fuzzy \u2013 but for today\u2019s young, they no longer even exist in separate spaces. Just one swipe separates the voice of a figure like Tate and the voice of a politician. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised if here is where ideas are shaped. Thrill of the new It is not yet clear how deeply these far-right sympathies are held. In a trend especially pronounced among young people, voters are increasingly \u201cnot loyal to any particular party or platform,\u201d says Foa. \u201cThey\u2019re very volatile between one election and the next.\u201d Just as young voters campaigned vociferously for green parties in 2019, their allegiances could switch again. The appeal of the far right may also be dampened if its politicians begin to govern. Out of office, the far right is unable to break promises, while it can point endlessly to the mainstream\u2019s inability to deliver. Once in government, it will prove just as disappointing. That, at least, appears to be\u00a0Macron\u2019s theory. But the burst in support for far-right parties could spell a darker trend. In his studies of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, Foa noted a growing penchant for authoritarianism. Lacking a personal memory of life under authoritarian rule or the struggle to achieve democracy, young people are less enamored with the system than previous generations. This success of far-right parties should be a warning to Europe\u2019s mainstream. To Churchill\u2019s famous quote, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others,\u201d we should not be surprised if young people ask in reply: \u201cReally?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_sport_michael-phelps-congress-doping", "text": "Legendary Olympic champion Michael Phelps on Tuesday urged Congress to pressure the World Anti-Doping Agency to enforce its regulations equally across all nations as an investigation over alleged doping by Chinese swimmers plays out ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. The most decorated Olympian in history made his plea to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations at a hearing focused on an alleged doping scandal involving almost two dozen Chinese swimmers. The Chinese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned performance-enhancing substance, several months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, where they went on to win medals, according to a report from The New York Times released in coordination with German public broadcaster ARD. Phelps argued WADA\u2019s handling of the case \u2013 which is under an independent review \u2013 showed the agency\u2019s reforms have \u201cfallen short.\u201d He asked Congress \u201cto use its considerable leverage with WADA to make the organization independent and effective.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t reasonably be a coincidence that (WADA) has yet again succumbed to the pressures of international sport,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cClose friends were potentially impacted by (WADA\u2019s) failure to follow its own rules in investigating the nearly two dozen positive tests on Chinese swimmers. Many of them will live with the \u2018what ifs\u2019 for the rest of their lives. \u201cAs athletes, our faith can no longer be blindly placed in the World Anti-Doping Agency, an organization that continues to proves that it is either incapable or unwilling to enforce its policies consistently around the world.\u201d The hearing is the latest action from lawmakers, who have called for the Department of Justice and the International Olympic Committee to investigate how WADA and the Chinese Anti-Doping Agency handled the positive tests. Former Olympic swimmer Allison Schmitt and US Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart also testified. Tygart has accused WADA and CHINADA of covering up the positive tests, which occurred seven months before the Tokyo Games in 2021, and of leaving other athletes in the dark. CHINADA has said the 23 athletes tested positive for an \u201cextremely low concentration\u201d of trimetazidine at a national swimming competition in 2021. Trimetazidine has the potential to boost endurance and has been banned by WADA since 2014. The agency decided the swimmers were not responsible for the results because they were inadvertently exposed to the drug. WADA was notified of the positive tests in June 2021, roughly a month before the Tokyo Games kicked off. In a news conference earlier this year, WADA President Witold Ba\u0144ka said the agency \u201cfollowed all due processes and diligently investigated every lead and line of enquiry in this matter\u201d and found \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing \u2026 and no credible way to disprove the contamination theory that was accepted by CHINADA.\u201d WADA has launched an independent review into its handling of the tests, and Ba\u0144ka was invited to testify at the Tuesday hearing as well. He declined to testify, according to a committee spokesperson. CHINADA has argued media reports about the situations are misleading. In a statement, WADA acknowledged the hearing and said it decided against sending a representative because \u201cthe relevant organizations with responsibility for the anti-doping during the Olympic Games were not invited to the hearing.\u201d The statement alleged that the hearing was more about geopolitics than it was about doping and that it was not appropriate for WADA to wade into the fray. Ba\u0144ka said the hearing pushed out misinformation regarding the alleged Chinese doping scandal and denied showing bias toward China. \u201cWADA understands the tense relationship that exists between the governments of China and U.S. and has no mandate to be part of that,\u201d Ba\u0144ka said. \u201cIt is not appropriate for anti-doping to be politicized in this way. All it does is weaken confidence in the system, which ultimately does not benefit athletes from the U.S. or anywhere else. WADA always endeavors to protect clean sport and treat athletes fairly, regardless of where in the world they are from.\u201d Lawmakers at the hearing \u2013 including the chairman of the subcommittee, Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia \u2013 raised the prospect of withholding US taxpayer funding from WADA if things don\u2019t improve. The US provides about $4 million annually to the agency, Griffith said. \u201cTheir refusal to appear today calls into question their commitment to accountability. If they\u2019re not going to do the job, we shouldn\u2019t even fund them,\u201d he said. Tygart slammed WADA\u2019s handling of the case and China\u2019s influence on the agency. He said 11 of the 23 swimmers who tested positive in 2021 are going to compete in next month\u2019s Games in Paris. Tygart said he\u2019s concerned about a cozy relationship between WADA and the Chinese government, including that WADA decided to close an investigation into allegations of \u201csystemic doping in China.\u201d \u201cWe can all understand why the world\u2019s athletes are incensed that WADA did not even open an investigation into the outrageous claims that China found a potent prescription-controlled drug that somehow mysteriously found its way into a hotel kitchen and into these athletes\u2019 samples,\u201d Tygart said. He added, \u201cWhat is worse \u2026 is that WADA has said they would do nothing different and would act the same today.\u201d The top Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, said Banka\u2019s refusal to appear at the hearing left critical questions unanswered. \u201cWhy did WADA accept CHINADA\u2019s conclusions? Why did WADA keep the violations secret? Why were Chinese athletes treated differently than athletes from other countries? Why were the Chinese swimmers not provisionally suspended? \u2026 Did reported payments from the (People\u2019s Republic of China) to WADA influence WADA\u2019s decision-making?\u201d she asked. \u201cThese unanswered questions are why I\u2019m especially disappointed that WADA refused the committee\u2019s invitation to testify today.\u201d Tygart wants Congress to condition US funding for WADA on the group setting up an independent committee of experts that will make rulings on positive tests that don\u2019t result in a rule violation, alleging that those decisions are made in secret. He also wants an audit of WADA to assess how it is complying with its own rules and responsibilities. Schmitt was candid about what it meant to her to lose to a Chinese relay team that would later come under suspicion. \u201cWe raced hard. We followed every protocol and accepted our defeat with grace. Three years later, news surfaced that some Chinese athletes on that team were not subjected to the same anti-doping rules, casting doubt on the fairness of the competition. With these revelations, many of us will be haunted by this podium finish that may have been impacted by doping,\u201d she said. She also detailed the effects the scandal has had on athletes preparing for next month\u2019s Games, saying, \u201cAs recently as last week at the US swimming Olympic trials, I witnessed the frustration and disappointment of young athletes whose confidence in the anti-doping system has been shattered. They deserve better. They deserve a level playing field where success is determined by talent, hard work and dedication \u2013 not by banned substances.\u201d Phelps told the lawmakers that the process is more proof that WADA does not enforce its rules equally across nations. He expressed disappointment that he is once again testifying to Congress about WADA\u2019s shortcomings, having appeared in front of the same committee in 2017. \u201cSitting here once again, it is clear to me that any attempts of reform at WADA have fallen short, and there are still deeply rooted systemic problems that prove detrimental to the integrity of international sports and athletes right to fair competition, time and time again,\u201d Phelps said.

The bulk carrier Philipp Oldendorff spotted a canoe-shaped boat adrift with people on board roughly 440 nautical miles, or about 815 km, south of Tenerife, and provided first aid to those affected while passenger ship Insignia was sent to the area, the Salvamento Maritimo statement said. The Insignia, owned by Oceania Cruises, rescued a total of 68 people and recovered three bodies, the agency said, adding that it could not recover the remains of two people due to poor weather conditions. On Thursday, Insignia\u2019s crew reported that one of the rescued migrants was in critical condition and needed to be evacuated. He died before a search and rescue helicopter could reach him, the agency said. The 62 men, three women and three minors rescued were from sub-Sahara Africa, according to the Insignia\u2019s\u00a0report\u00a0to the agency. \u201cSafety of life at sea is of paramount importance for all seafarers,\u201d an Oceania Cruises spokesperson told CNN via email. \u201cWe can confirm that Insignia rescued 68 people from a vessel in distress between Cape Verde and Tenerife and bought them onboard for medical assistance and provided food, drinks, clothing and a safe place to rest.

Playing in her first international tournament this week, the 17-year-old has already created headlines after dominating at the FIBA Under-18 Women\u2019s Asia Cup, helping China remain unbeaten in its first two games. On Monday, Zhang came off the bench for her international debut and scored 19 points on 9-for-9 shooting in just 13 minutes, helping China brush aside Indonesia 109-50. She also racked up seven rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) subsequently released a video of her game highlights, showing the youngster towering over opponents and barely needing to jump to dunk the ball. Given her height advantage, she looked devastating in defense while demonstrating her shooting accuracy from distance. The footage has since gone viral on social media. \u201cZhang Ziyu is a cheat code,\u201d a social media user said on X, formerly known as Twitter. After Monday\u2019s breakthrough game, Zhang is showing no signs of slowing down. Earlier on Tuesday, the center totaled 36 points on 80% shooting along with 13 rebounds and four blocks as she inspired China past New Zealand 90-68 to maintain its perfect start to the tournament. China next plays on Wednesday against Japan, with the teenager set to star once again. FIBA lists Zhang as 7-foot-3 on its official website, meaning she is only one inch shorter than San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama. Given her height and nationality, social media users have already compared her to NBA legend Yao Ming, who was just three inches taller. While Zhang has a long way to go before matching Yao\u2019s career, her performances this week will surely pique the interest of teams across the WNBA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/zhang-ziyu-basketball-star-china-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_south-sudan-migration-c2e-spc-intl", "text": "From an aerial view, golden-brown specks cover the grass like ants. Zoom in and you\u2019ll see horns, backs, legs moving \u2013 all in the same direction. Antelopes, hundreds of thousands of them, are crossing the savannas of South Sudan. The central African country has been ravaged by war over the last few decades, making it unsafe for scientific research, and data on the movement of wildlife there has been limited. But a report published today estimates that South Sudan is home to the largest known migration of land mammals on Earth. Five million white-eared kob, 300,000 tiang, 350,000 Mongalla gazelle and 160,000 Bohor reedbuck (all species of antelope) are thought to traverse the landscape each year, moving from the savannas in the south of the country towards the wetlands in the north and east. The estimates come from a 2023 aerial survey of the\u00a0land around the Boma and Badingilo national parks and Jonglei region, referred to as \u201cthe Great Nile Migration Landscape.\u201d A plane flew over transects of land at a constant height above ground,\u00a0sampling\u00a0almost 4,000 square kilometers\u00a0(1,500 square miles) of a\u00a0122,000-square-kilometer (47,000-square-mile) area,\u00a0while an observer recorded what they saw, and a camera, fixed to the plane, took a photo every two seconds. The method is commonly used to assess the distribution of wild animals in large open spaces and was previously done in the region in the 2000s and the 1980s, during relatively peaceful intervals between periods of unrest. The latest results have astounded scientists: while wildlife has decreased in many areas of the world due to human development and climate change, this data shows that the migration has not only survived years of war but expanded. \u201cIf the numbers are right with these species, it looks like they\u2019ve increased since 2007. It looks like they\u2019ve increased since the 1980s even,\u201d says Mike Fay, lead researcher and conservation director for African Parks in South Sudan. He cautions that the margins of error are large, but even at its lowest estimate of four million antelope, the figure dwarfs the roughly two million wildebeest that move across Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti, in what has long been considered the world\u2019s largest land mammal migration. The distances covered also rival the world\u2019s longest annual land migration. While routes vary between species, the survey found that some tiang covered more than 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) \u2013 putting them on a par with caribou in Canada\u2019s Arctic. Fay, who has been working on conservation projects in Africa for more than 40 years, admits his exposure to natural phenomena has been extensive. He\u2019s seen countless elephants, lions, gorillas and other iconic animals. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to impress me, right?\u201d he says. Yet, when he observed thousands upon thousands of antelope running across the landscape, even he was flabbergasted. \u201cHow is it even possible that there can be this many wild animals?\u201d he marvels. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a sentimental thing for me, it\u2019s more about the biological and ecological capacity of this land to produce so much wildlife. It\u2019s truly phenomenal.\u201d War and peace The migration\u2019s survival \u2013 and growth \u2013 is likely to be linked to the decades of instability in the country, says Fay. South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of civil war. Quickly after that it descended into its own civil war, which ended in 2018, although local violence continues. As a result, the human footprint has remained low \u2013 the United Nations lists it among the least developed countries in the world. \u201cMaybe that provided this opportunity where the animals were left alone for a period of 10 to 12 years, and that\u2019s when they became much more numerous,\u201d Fay speculates. This idea is supported by data from GPS devices that were fixed onto around 125 antelopes, tracking their movements over the last year. While the sample is too small to make big assumptions, one thing is clear, says Fay: \u201cThese animals try to avoid humans as much as they can.\u201d Their tracks form a pattern like a donut, he says, with the antelopes circling around human settlements. In contrast, non-migratory animals that were unable to avoid human populations have not fared so well. The survey cites catastrophic declines in sedentary species such as giraffe, buffalo, zebra, hartebeest and waterbuck. \u201cThere was a gigantic proliferation of guns in the country, and you had thousands and thousands of people living in the bush. They weren\u2019t cultivating, so they were eating a lot of wildlife and feeding the troops with wildlife,\u201d says Fay. While moving wildlife populations could head to remote hinterlands, sedentary species were easy targets. \u201cThose species got hammered,\u201d he adds. However, the lack of development has meant that the natural ecosystem around the migration remains more or less intact. South Sudan often refers to itself as \u201cthe land of great abundance\u201d and in many respects, it lives up to this, says Fay. Despite being land-locked, South Sudan has vast freshwater resources, including Africa\u2019s largest wetland, the Sudd, which is fed by the overflow of the White Nile. The name is derived from the Arabic word for barrier, and for centuries the area was deemed impenetrable \u2013 the Sudd marked the southern limit of the Roman Empire\u2019s expansion into Africa. This remoteness has helped to protect the region\u2019s biodiversity. \u201cOn most places on Earth, major river floodplains have had levees built along them, or they\u2019ve been overused and degraded,\u201d says Fay. \u201cWhereas here, the water comes out of the mountains, hits that gigantic floodplain and just fans out \u2026 The fact that you\u2019ve got this enormous floodplain still functioning in this modern world is phenomenal.\u201d It is this unique floodplain that brought conservation biologist Steve Boyes to South Sudan to support African Parks in the survey.\u00a0As part of his Great Spine of Africa expedition, in partnership with the Rolex Perpetual Planet Initiative, he wanted to document how the watersheds and rivers \u2013 what he calls \u201cthe lifelines of these landscapes\u201d \u2013 were playing into the annual migration. He explains that the region has experienced record-breaking floods in recent years, in part due to pollution from South Sudan\u2019s capital Juba, as plastic and human waste enter the river that flows into the Sudd and block the waterways. This could threaten the wider ecosystem and wildlife populations. \u201cWe\u2019ve got water consuming the landscape, restricting where a migration can go,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got growing human settlements, creating a smaller corridor. Those dynamics \u2013 human development, encroachment, and the flooding of the White Nile \u2013 will become more of a problem for migration.\u201d \u201cOften in these post-war wildernesses, peace becomes a serious threat to wildlife populations,\u201d he adds. Opportunity Fay fears the same. Wildlife has thrived in the \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d enforced by the conflict, but now that the nation is in a period of relative calm, efforts to restore it are firing up. \u201cRoads are being built, industrial activities are starting to happen, people\u2019s mobility is increasing, the tribal boundaries are becoming diluted,\u201d he says. \u201cAs they erode, as transport infrastructure becomes possible, that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to see a massive collapse of these animals.\u201d He explains that migratory species are particularly vulnerable to linear developments such as roads because a physical barrier can cut off their migration path, while also exposing them to hunting. But development doesn\u2019t have to be bad for wildlife, he argues. If looked after, the migration could bring a number of benefits \u2013 it could even be \u201can engine for development,\u201d Fay says, pointing to Tanzania, where the Serengeti national park, home to a vast wildebeest migration, pulls in as many as 200,000 tourists each year. Boyes notes there could also be opportunities to generate carbon revenue from the Sudd swamps or establish community-run conservancies that bring benefits to both nature and people. But Fay warns that conservation is always hard, and it takes time. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to build an economy around this migration, the lag time between the cost and the benefit is great,\u201d he says. Mass tourism is still a long way off in a country that has the reputation for being one of the most dangerous in the world, and as it struggles with a fragile and stagnant economy and the ongoing conflict and crisis in neighboring Sudan, wildlife may pay the price. \u201cLiquidation of natural resources is the fastest way to make a buck,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a country like South Sudan to forgo some aspect of development for something that might not produce tomorrow, that\u2019s where the political will comes in, and the will of the people.\u201d Currently, political will does seem to be there. African Parks carried out the survey with the support of the South Sudan government and the results will be used to inform the country\u2019s wildlife conservation strategy for the area. At a press conference announcing the results of the survey, the country\u2019s president, Salva Kiir Mayardit, said, \u201cAs South Sudan continues to develop we are committed to transforming the wildlife sector into a sustainable tourism industry. To activate this I call upon the security forces, particularly the Ministry of Wildlife and its partners to prioritize the training and equipping of wildlife rangers to combat poaching and trafficking of illegal wildlife products in protected areas.\u201d Fay believes funding will be key. \u201cThe nation has to decide, do we want to maintain this migration or not?\u201d he says. If yes, it then needs to invest heavily in conservation and land management, to preserve these unique natural areas. \u201cWe have a window of opportunity,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s closing as we speak.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/south-sudan-migration-c2e-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said a suspected balloon was seen flying in northern Gyeonggi Province, which borders Seoul, around 9 p.m. local time (8 p.m. ET). About 100 of the\u00a0balloons\u00a0fell inside\u00a0South\u00a0Korean\u00a0regions, most of which were found in\u00a0north\u00a0of Gyeonggi Province and capital Seoul with \u201cno hazardous substances\u201d found so far, it said. Seoul\u2019s Metropolitan government later sent out a push notification alerting the city that a North Korean balloon had entered the sky over Seoul, adding that citizens should refrain from touching downed balloons and report any sightings to authorities. The South Korean military has\u00a0warned it could restart loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts at the border \u2014 which it had paused for the last few years \u2014\u00a0adding whether Seoul resumes the loudspeakers is \u201cup to\u00a0North\u00a0Korea\u2019s actions.\u201d \u201cOur military is ready to immediately start anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts, and will operate with flexibility according to the strategical and operational situation,\u201d said the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday. North Korea has sent over 1,000 balloons toward the South since May, which\u00a0it calls\u00a0reprisals for South Korean activists flying leaflets that contain materials critical of the regime of its leader Kim Jong\u00a0Un. On Thursday, a South Korean advocacy group flew 20 large balloons carrying thousands of anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets and USB sticks with South Korean entertainment toward North Korea. A day later, on Friday, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea\u2019s leader, warned of \u201ctrouble\u201d ahead. \u201cWhen you do something you were clearly warned not to do, it\u2019s only natural that you will find yourself dealing with something you didn\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. A South Korean analysis of North Korean balloons sent between late May and early June detected parasites in the balloons\u2019 soil, which \u201cmay have originated from human feces,\u201d the ministry said, pointing to \u201chuman genes\u201d found in the soil. The analysis found roundworms, whipworms and larva currens along with other waste, such as cloth and wastepaper, the ministry said, adding there was no risk of contamination or infectious disease from the analyzed soil. The balloons also carried damaged clothes from a South Korean brand, signaling \u201chostility towards South Korean goods,\u201d as well as clothes with imitations of Disney characters, according to the ministry. The latest balloon salvo comes as tensions on the Korean Peninsula heighten, and inter-Korean diplomacy remains at an impasse.\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a defense agreement with North Korea last week as talks on its denuclearization efforts have stalled, and Kim has\u00a0vowed to expand his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal\u00a0and threatened to use it against the South. In the meantime, a US Navy aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea over the weekend ahead of trilateral exercises with South Korea and Japan in the waters near the peninsula. It is the latest in a series of US military moves aiming to affirm Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to its treaty ally in South Korea. US and South Korean officials signed a\u00a0new memorandum of understanding\u00a0on diplomatic intelligence sharing and analysis on Monday, according to South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry.

{"id": "2024_06_25_weather_us-summer-heat-forecast-climate", "text": "Summer is off to a sweltering start after multiple record-breaking heat events sent temperatures soaring for millions of people in the US. So when will it end? Forecasts for the coming weeks and months show exceptional heat is largely here to stay, with only fleeting periods of respite. And the sobering summer reality on a planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution is the heat isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 it\u2019s only going to get more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise. \u201cSummers like the one we are experiencing now and the summer we had last year \u2013 which was the hottest on record \u2013 are going to become par for the course in the years ahead,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. A sign of things to come There will still be colder-than-average summers in the future, but climate change is making it likelier more summers will end up hotter-than-average, Dahl told CNN. And the fingerprints of a changing climate are already visible, even before summer has reached its hottest months. This spring, hundreds of cities in the eastern half of the US experienced one of their 10 hottest Mays on record in what was another sign of a changing climate: dangerous heat seeping into typically cooler seasons. Early season heat waves add to the danger of what\u2019s already the deadliest weather threat because the body can\u2019t gradually acclimatize, or cope better with the heat, Dahl explained. Acclimation or not, the abnormally hot temperatures are also altering the perception of what\u2019s hot. Temperatures through at least midweek will climb up to 10 degrees above normal in parts of the western and southern US, but that pales in comparison to last week\u2019s roasting conditions. Summer should be hot, just not this hot: Parts of the central and eastern US sweltered through temperatures 25 or 30 degrees above normal last week. The heat was so extreme Caribou, Maine, a town just 10 miles from the Canadian border, hit 96 degrees, tying its all-time record high temperature. \u201cThis is not your grandmother\u2019s heat, this is significantly different,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cThis (heat) really isn\u2019t normal and it\u2019s measurably influenced by climate change.\u201d The hottest is yet to come Forecasts for the next few weeks, the next month and the rest of the summer all show one trend clearer than anything else: hotter-than-average temperatures for large sections of the US. Above average temperatures are expected into early July for a vast majority of the Lower 48 with the exception of states along the northernmost tier of the country, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center. July is typically the hottest month of the year, but it is expected to be even hotter than normal this summer in almost every state. Most of the East and parts of the Rockies are likely to be the most anomalously warm areas next month. This prolonged heat could be record-breaking. Last July in Phoenix was the hottest month ever experienced in any US city. The city\u2019s average July temperature \u2013 calculated based on both high and low temperatures for the month \u2013 was an astonishing 102.7 degrees. Heat in Phoenix last summer wasn\u2019t just extreme, it was long-lasting. Its longevity and dangerously high daytime and overnight temperatures took a toll on human health. The scorching July contributed to the deadliest year for heat in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, since officials began keeping records in 2003. Heat lasted well beyond July last summer for much of the US. A series of unrelenting heat domes baked huge parts of the country with the effects of each worsened by the one before. Every heat dome that parked over part of the country roasted the ground, dried out soils and made subsequent temperatures even hotter. This year looks to be no different. Warmer-than-normal conditions are expected to extend through the summer and most of the fall, according to the CPC. Warmer-than-normal falls aren\u2019t nearly as dangerous as hot summers. But the cooler seasons only mask the lingering threat of extreme heat as long as global temperatures continue to rise, which scientists say can only be mitigated by dramatically reducing or phasing out planet-polluting fossil fuel use. \u201cThe more we try to normalize (heat), the greater the danger we have of taking our eye off the ball in terms of what needs to be done to address climate change,\u201d Dahl said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/weather/us-summer-heat-forecast-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

Opposition figure Leila De Lima, who was released on bail last November after\u00a0she was acquitted of two counts, was cleared of a third and final charge on Monday, her lawyer told state broadcaster PTV. The charges stemmed from allegations by Duterte that De Lima had received payoffs from convicted drug gangs to fund her 2016 senatorial bid. More than 6,000 people were killed in\u00a0anti-drug operations\u00a0during Duterte\u2019s tenure as president from 2016 to 2022, according to police data. Many of the extrajudicial killings of suspected drug offenders took place in the poorest areas of the country \u2013 and independent monitors believe the number of those killed could be much higher. Human rights activists had long criticized De Lima\u2019s prosecution and lengthy detention, pointing out that she was held in a police cell despite not having been convicted of any charges. They say her treatment is emblematic of a deteriorating rights situation in a country where political activists and the media often face threats, harassment and even death for attempting to keep those in power in check. On Monday, supporters who gathered outside the courthouse in Muntinlupa city shouted, \u201cLeila is free,\u201d according to a livestreamed video posted on her official Facebook page. Speaking to reporters outside the court, De Lima said\u00a0Duterte would be held responsible for \u201csins committed\u201d against Filipinos. \u201cI\u2019m only one of the victims. Thousands of Filipinos were murdered during the bloody and fake \u2018drug war.\u2019 Many families lost loved ones,\u201d she said. \u201cFor those who weren\u2019t killed, they were left languishing in jail because of the incorrect and twisted enforcement of the law. I\u2019m one of those who have experienced unjust imprisonment.\u201d During his tenure as president, Duterte\u00a0repeatedly said the\u00a0killings\u00a0of\u00a0drug\u00a0suspects are lawful if police are acting in self defense. He had previously admitted to killing drug suspects\u00a0during his time as mayor of Davao City. In July last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC)\u00a0rejected an appeal by the Philippine government to block an investigation by prosecutors into Duterte\u2019s drug war. An ICC judge said the dismissal by the Hague-based court meant the Philippines has exhausted its options to appeal. Duterte\u2019s administration and its successor under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have pushed back against the ICC\u2019s probe, denouncing the investigations as unjust. The Philippines was formerly a signatory to the ICC but Duterte canceled the country\u2019s membership after the court began probing his drug war. But under the ICC\u2019s withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state \u2013 in this case, between 2016 and 2019, when the Philippines\u2019 pullout became official.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/philippines-leila-de-lima-acquitted-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Picasso pieces are now displayed in an upgraded restroom with a fully functional toilet dubbed \u201cLadies Room,\u201d located within the art venue, Kaechele said in an e-mail. \u201cWhile the Ladies Lounge undergoes a series of reforms to meet the exemptions required for reopening, I\u2019ve been doing a little redecorating. I thought a few of the bathrooms in the museum could do with an update,\u201d she added. \u201cSome Cubism in the cubicles.\u201d On Monday, Kaechele posted on Instagram a video and images of the relocated works in situ, and pointed out that the gendered restroom was also a first for the museum. She encouraged \u201call ladies\u201d to enjoy the new exhibition. \u2018Ladies Lounge\u2019 closed \u201cWe never had female toilets at Mona before, they were all unisex. But then the Ladies Lounge had to close thanks to a lawsuit brought on by a man. And I just didn\u2019t know what to do with all those Picassos\u2026,\u201d wrote Kaechele, who is also the wife of MONA\u2019s owner, David Walsh. Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales was barred from entering the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d exhibit on April 1 in 2023. Lau, who had paid the $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, believed he experienced direct gender discrimination. \u201cHe felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,\u201d read the tribunal\u2019s notes. After the judgment, Kaechele said she would challenge the court\u2019s decision in the state\u2019s Supreme Court and offered several possibilities to revive the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d concept. Among those ideas included finding loopholes under Section 27 of the Anti-Discrimination Act which lists exceptions on when discrimination against gender would be permitted. In the meantime the lounge closed so that it wouldn\u2019t have to open to men. Kaechele later discussed potential ways to reopen \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d as a church, school, toilet and more in a Q&A that was published on the museum\u2019s website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/australia-mona-museum-picasso-restroom-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_27_europe_julian-assange-profile-intl-cmd", "text": "Julian Assange\u00a0started his WikiLeaks whistleblowing website on a quest for \u201cradical transparency and truth,\u201d a mission that turned an already polarizing personality into a notorious character and\u00a0earned him\u00a0crusaders and critics\u00a0in equal measure. His\u00a0long-running battle against extradition to the United States had been making its way through UK courts for years until a remarkable plea deal on Monday. Assange, 52, left the UK after agreeing to plead guilty to a single felony charge in exchange for time served. The deal is set to be finalized in a remote US court in the Pacific on Wednesday morning, after which he is expected to return to his native Australia. It has been 12 years since Assange was a free man. He spent the past five years in London\u2019s high-security Belmarsh prison and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in the English capital,\u00a0trying to avoid arrest. He was facing life imprisonment in the US for publishing hundreds of thousands of sensitive military and government documents supplied by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning more than a dozen years ago. But recently there has been increased pressure for a resolution to Assange\u2019s case. In April, US President Joe Biden offered\u00a0Assange\u2019s supporters a glimmer of hope saying his administration was\u00a0\u201cconsidering\u201d a request from Australia\u00a0to drop its charges against the WikiLeaks founder. The remarks were described as an \u201cencouraging\u201d signal by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who added that Assange had \u201calready paid a significant price\u201d and \u201cenough is enough.\u201d The ascent of Assange Born in Townsville, eastern Queensland, in 1971, Assange had a less than conventional upbringing. His education was a combination of home schooling and correspondence courses, since his family moved frequently. In his teens, he discovered a natural proficiency for computing, but his activities \u2013 which included accessing several secure systems, including the Pentagon and NASA, under the hacker alias \u201cMendax\u201d \u2013 soon put him on the radar of authorities. In 1991, he was charged with 31 counts of cybercrime by Australian authorities but only received a small fine at sentencing after pleading guilty to most of the charges. Following his brush with the law, Assange worked as a computer security consultant, traveled and briefly studied physics at the University of Melbourne before withdrawing from the course. His vision when starting WikiLeaks in 2006 was that it would be a kind of online repository, which would publish anonymously submitted documents, video and other sensitive materials after vetting them. It ran for several years, uploading material ranging from the US military\u2019s operating manual for its detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to internal documents from the Church of Scientology and some of 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin\u2019s stolen emails. But it was catapulted to global attention in 2010 with a video that later became known as \u201cCollateral Murder.\u201d Back then, journalist Atika Shubert caught wind of footage circulating which claimed to show a deadly 2007 US helicopter attack in Iraq. Then a reporter for CNN in London, Shubert tracked down the individual in possession of the footage. On first impressions, Assange was \u201cvague\u201d and \u201celusive,\u201d Shubert recalled. With the benefit of hindsight, she now believes his behavior was the result of \u201csitting on this cache of documents from Chelsea Manning and trying to figure out how to publish it.\u201d He showed up unannounced at CNN\u2019s London office soon after, a USB stick with thousands of classified documents in the palm of his hand. \u201cThat was my first introduction to the world of data dumps and what exactly WikiLeaks was doing - the scale of it - which I had never heard of before,\u201d Shubert said. WikiLeaks ultimately released the video from the US helicopter attack in Iraq, sparking condemnation from human rights activists and earning rebuke from US defense officials. By the year\u2019s end, the organization had gone on to publish nearly half a million classified documents relating to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under a global spotlight As WikiLeaks continued its disclosures, Assange found himself the latest cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre \u2013 his every movement intensely scrutinized. And with each headline, his infamy grew among those who did not share his vision. Fidel Narvaez, former consul of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, met Assange in 2011, after WikiLeaks released another huge archive \u2013 this time of secret US diplomatic cables. The pair became close friends through the years. \u201cAssange can be stubborn, sometimes he can clash with other people, but once you know him \u2026 he is extremely respectful and warm. He has a great sense of humor,\u201d Narvaez told CNN. \u201cHis one mission in life is publishing, which is what he has done with WikiLeaks.\u201d Assange\u2019s story, as the \u201cteen hacker who became insurgent in information war\u201d as the Guardian put it in 2011, sounded like the plot of a Hollywood blockbuster. Soon his tale was immortalized in documentaries and films, perhaps most notably in 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Fifth Estate,\u201d which Assange labeled a \u201cgeriatric snoozefest\u201d that used what he considered flawed source material. For journalist and author James Ball, who briefly worked at WikiLeaks and was based for a time at Ellingham Hall, a remote manor house north of London where Assange holed up before seeking refuge in Ecuador\u2019s embassy, the infancy of WikiLeaks was an \u201cexhilarating\u201d time. \u201cYou were working on the kind of material that we (had) really never seen before. Leaks have become a bit more common since, but the idea that you could peruse through these huge sets of records that showed what happened in conflicts or what actually happened in closed rooms, was sort of completely new,\u201d Ball told CNN. WikiLeaks became a household name thanks to its frequent data dumps, but some were starting to question the founder\u2019s behavior. For many, his polarizing personality became an issue. Ball added: \u201cHe sort of liked the attention. \u2026 He liked the fuss that (the disclosures) caused but he was oddly incurious actually about the documents.\u201d Others offer alternative explanations for Assange\u2019s eccentricities. Narvaez said the Assange he knew was \u201chyperactive and workaholic\u201d and pointed to his diagnosed autism spectrum disorder as an element of his personality. Shifting attitudes Such questions aside, WikiLeaks essentially ground to a halt when Assange was accused of sexual assault in Sweden in August 2010. The organization\u2019s focus shifted from offense to defense, despite the transparency campaigner\u2019s vehement denial of the allegations against him. There were mounting calls for Assange to leave WikiLeaks and, when he didn\u2019t, many cut ties with it. Assange labeled it \u201ca smear campaign\u201d orchestrated to pave the way for his further extradition to the US and refused to go to Sweden for questioning. In June 2012, while out on bail from UK officials over the Swedish probe, he opted for a nuclear option and knocked on the door at 3 Hans Crescent, where he requested political asylum from Ecuador. Outside the confines of his diplomatic shelter, the world questioned whether Assange was trying to circumvent justice. Over time, his relationship with his host soured along with the arrival of a new president in Ecuador in 2017. Assange was \u201can inherited problem\u201d for Lenin Moreno, who was facing pressure from the US to expel him from the diplomatic bolthole. \u201cIt was obvious that former President Moreno was going to give in to external and internal pressure,\u201d Narvaez said. Narvaez, seen as too close to the unwanted houseguest, was asked to leave in July 2018 amid a shake-up of the diplomatic mission\u2019s staff. \u201cI left him isolated, and I was the last person he trusted,\u201d Narvaez said. Nine months later, in April 2019, Assange was pulled kicking and screaming from the building by London\u2019s Metropolitan Police on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department. Legal limbo Once in British custody, Assange had lived, mostly isolated, in a three-by-two-meter cell at Belmarsh prison in southeast London. The prison has the capacity to hold over 900 inmates and is known for once housing infamous terror suspects such as\u00a0Abu Hamza al-Masri\u00a0within its high-security unit. The US accused Assange of endangering lives by publishing secret military documents in 2010 and 2011. He was wanted on 18 criminal charges relating to his organization\u2019s dissemination of classified material and diplomatic cables and faced up to 175 years in prison conditions much harsher than here in the UK. Fighting his corner since he entered Belmarsh: his wife, Stella Assange. The couple married in March 2022, while he was in prison. Stella, the mother of Assange\u2019s two young sons, called her husband a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d outside court in March and has repeatedly voiced her fear that, if extradited, he could take his own life. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about how he\u2019s doing. Physically, he\u2019s aged prematurely,\u201d she previously told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s on medication. As you know, in October 2021, he had a mini-stroke and he has all sorts of health problems.\u201d She had labeled the US\u2019 latest guarantees that Assange could lean on First Amendment protections at trial\u00a0\u201cblatant weasel words\u201d in a statement on April 16. \u201cThe diplomatic note does nothing to relieve our family\u2019s extreme distress about his future \u2013 his grim expectation of spending the rest of his life in isolation in US prison for publishing award-winning journalism,\u201d she said. Nick Vamos, head of business crime at Peters & Peters law firm and a former head of extradition at the UK\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service, told CNN that on the other side of the coin, some might suggest that \u201cyou should allow the judicial system to follow through to its conclusion\u201d without being influenced by protests from supporters. Assange\u2019s team had argued his potential extradition was for political reasons and that a handover to the US violated the European Convention on Human Rights. It was a claim supported by independent experts. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Jill Edwards, in February called on the British government to halt a possible extradition and reiterated her concerns about Assange\u2019s fitness and \u201cthe potential for him to receive a wholly disproportionate sentence in the United States.\u201d Marking Assange\u2019s five years at Belmarsh, Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General Agn\u00e8s Callamard had warned that Assange, if extradited, would \u201cbe at risk of serious abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, which would violate the prohibition on torture or other ill-treatment.\u201d \ufeffShe added that US assurances over his treatment could not be relied upon as they are \u201criddled with loopholes.\u201d Far-reaching repercussions Beyond the personal costs for Assange, many had expressed concern about the broader implications for press freedom around the world if he had been sent to the US. Five international media organizations that collaborated with Assange previously called the US government to end its prosecution of him for publishing classified material. In a 2022 letter, representatives for The New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds and Der Spiegel argued publishing is not a crime. \u201cObtaining and disclosing sensitive information when necessary in the public interest is a core part of the daily work of journalists. If that work is criminalised, our public discourse and our democracies are made significantly weaker,\u201d the letter stated. Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the plea deal averted \u201cthe worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day. He continued, \u201cIt will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.\u201d Likewise, former Guardian editor and collaborator Alan Rusbridger wrote on X that while it was \u201cgood news that Assange is apparently free,\u201d he expressed concern at the repercussions of his years-long legal battle. \u201cHis treatment was a warning to journalists and whistleblowers to keep quiet in future,\u201d he added. And I suspect it will have worked.\u201d This story has been updated with latest developments following Assange\u2019s US plea deal.

{"id": "2024_06_23_style_las-vegas-mystery-monolith-removed-intl-hnk", "text": "A strange monolith\u00a0found jutting out of the rocks\u00a0in a remote mountain range near Las Vegas has been taken down by authorities. How it got there is still unsolved. \u201cIt remains unknown how the item got to its location or who might be responsible,\u201d Las Vegas police said Friday in a series of posts on X announcing the removal of the glimmering, 6-foot-4 prism. Its discovery over the previous weekend, and quick removal because of public safety and environmental concerns, revived a pandemic-era mystery that captured the public\u2019s imagination when shiny monoliths evoking the object that appears in the Stanley Kubrick movie \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d began to appear around the globe. Members of the Las Vegas police search and rescue team found the object near Gass Peak, part of the vast Desert National Wildlife Refuge where bighorn sheep and desert tortoises can be found roaming. It was the latest discovery in a\u00a0series of mysterious columns that have popped up since at least 2020. In November of that year, a similar metal monolith was found deep in the Mars-like landscape of Utah\u2019s red-rock desert. Then came sightings in Romania, central California, New Mexico and on the famed Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. All of them\u00a0disappeared as quickly\u00a0as they popped up, adding to the lore. \u201cThis thing is not from another world,\u201d Lt. Nick Street of Utah\u2019s Department of Public Safety said at the time. The Utah monolith, believed to be the first in the series, had been embedded in the rock in an area so remote that officials didn\u2019t immediately reveal its location for fear of people getting lost or stranded while trying to find it. But internet sleuths quickly found the coordinates, and hordes of curious tourists eager to see and touch the otherworldly object arrived, flattening plants with their cars and leaving behind human waste in the bathroom-free backcountry. Authorities said the same concerns led them to tear down the latest monolith on Thursday. It was illegally installed on federal land established to protect bighorn sheep and is home to rare plants and desert tortoises. The Desert National Wildlife Refuge, which is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is the largest wildlife refuge outside of Alaska and can cover the state of Rhode Island twice. Christa Weise, acting manager of the wildlife refuge, confirmed Friday that the monolith had been removed but said she couldn\u2019t comment on whether federal authorities have opened a criminal investigation. The police department said the object was being kept at a secret location while authorities try to figure out the best way to dispose or store the massive structure made out of a reflective sheet of metal that was molded into a prism and secured with rebar and concrete. Photos accompanying the department\u2019s social media posts showed the object on its side after its removal, which left a large indent in the ground because the rebar had been buried deep into the dirt and rocks. The department said it \u201cdiscourages anyone from venturing off marked trails or leaving objects and items behind.\u201d \u201cThis poses a danger to you and the environment,\u201d Las Vegas police said. In Utah, the removal of the monolith there also left behind a hole in the red rock. The Bureau of Land Management said Friday that it was still actively investigating the Utah case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/style/las-vegas-mystery-monolith-removed-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_middleeast_israel-hostage-forum-video-netanyahu-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said he was still \u201ccommitted\u201d to an Israeli ceasefire and hostage release proposal backed by the United States as he faced blowback from families of Israeli hostages for appearing to walk back his support of the proposal the day before. The proposal, outlined by US President Joe Biden last month, sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But on Sunday, Netanyahu told Israel\u2019s Channel 14 he was ready to make \u201ca partial deal\u201d with Hamas to return only some hostages from Gaza, in comments that were at odds with the proposal, which was approved by his own war cabinet. He added that Israel will continue fighting in the enclave after the ceasefire. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the war is going to end, but the war in its current stage is going to end in Rafah. This is true. We will continue mowing the grass later,\u201d Netanyahu told the right-wing broadcaster in what was his first one-to-one interview with local Israeli media since October 7. His apparent dismissal of the ceasefire and hostage release proposal faced an angry backlash from Israeli politicians and a group representing Israel\u2019s hostages and their families, which has become a potent political force in the country. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum called Netanyahu\u2019s comments to Channel 14 \u201can unprecedented national failure and a failure to meet the goals of the war.\u201d Opposition figure Gadi Eisenkot \u2013 who resigned from Israel\u2019s war cabinet a week before Netanyahu disbanded it \u2013 also slammed Netanyahu, saying \u201cthere are soldiers who are fighting now because they have war goals to return the hostages.\u201d On Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US opposes continued military operations in Gaza. \u201cThat\u2019s just a recipe for continued conflict, continued instability and continued insecurity for Israel,\u201d he told a press briefing. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum later released a video showing the kidnapping of three Israelis by Hamas on October 7. The video shows Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Or Levy and Eliya Cohen in the back of a pickup truck, being driven along a tree-lined road in southern Israel by militants wielding assault weapons. \u201cHere are the dogs, here they are,\u201d one of the gunmen can be heard saying. Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli citizen then age 23, can be seen with his face bloodied and what appears to be bone protruding from his left arm \u2013 blown off after a grenade was tossed into the bunker in which he and several others had been hiding from Hamas gunmen. Goldberg-Polin\u2019s family told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that they agreed to releasing the video of their son because world leaders \u201cmaybe need a wake-up call.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s horrific. It\u2019s gut-wrenching. It\u2019s a\u00a0video that no parent wants to\u00a0see of their kid,\u201d Jon Polin said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that\u00a0people in the world see the\u00a0videos, understand what\u2019s\u00a0happening, understand what\u00a0happened on October 7, and most\u00a0particularly, that leaders of\u00a0the world see it.\u201d Hamas released a video of Goldberg-Polin in April, the first proof that he survived the blast. In the video, he criticized Netanyahu\u2019s government, as other Israeli hostages in Hamas propaganda videos have done. Held in Gaza for six months at the time, he was almost certainly speaking under duress. \u201cEvery day that passes puts the hostages at greater risk and diminishes our chances of bringing them back safely,\u201d the Forum said in a statement, calling for a deal that brings all of the hostages home. \u2018An important correction\u2019 Netanyahu scrambled to walk back his comments to Channel 14. On Monday, an Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel has stressed to Hamas through mediators Qatar and Egypt that it\u2019s committed to the Israeli ceasefire and hostage release proposal. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s words at the Knesset were an important correction. To this day he has not said publicly that he supports the Israeli proposal.\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s words move the ball to Hamas\u2019 court. If Hamas says yes, there will be a deal. We now need to push for a deal with everything we got,\u201d the Israeli source said. In a short statement issued after his interview Sunday, Netanyahu\u2019s office sought to clarify what he said, saying the prime minister had \u201cmade it clear that we will not leave Gaza until we return all 120 of our hostages, living and deceased.\u201d Seeking to row back his explosive comments even further, Netanyahu on Monday told the Knesset: \u201cWe are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden welcomed. Our position has not changed.\u201d The release of the video may be intended to refocus minds in Israel\u2019s security cabinet, reminding Netanyahu and other senior officials of the war\u2019s initial aim to return the hostages, many of whom remain in Gaza nearly nine months after their abduction. It came as the number of hostages believed to be dead rose to 42 with the announcement by the Israeli military that one of its soldiers, Sergeant Major Mhamad El Atrash, 39, was killed on October 7 and that his body is being held by Hamas. Previously, on June 8, the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office said it believes that at least 41 hostages from the October 7 attack are dead, with their bodies being held in the Gaza Strip. At least five American hostages are believed to be held alive and four others believed to be dead. More than a million Palestinians were taking shelter in Rafah before Israel started its air and ground operation in the southern Gazan city, defying calls from the international community not to proceed. Around 800,000 people have since been displaced from Rafah, where\u00a0conditions\u00a0have been described by the United Nations food agency as \u201capocalyptic.\u201d The\u00a0city\u2019s border crossing\u00a0with Egypt \u2014 a vital entry point for humanitarian aid \u2014 has remained closed since the Israeli military seized it early last month. And international pressure on Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza have mounted since it started its operation in Rafah.

Netanyahu\u2019s comments were at odds with the aims of a broader proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last month. That plan, which the US has said is an Israeli one, sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces. Israeli opposition politician Gadi Eisenkot said Netanyahu\u2019s remarks about a \u201cpartial deal\u201d contradicted the wishes of the country\u2019s recently-disbanded war cabinet, of which Eisenkot was a member. \u201cA deal in one step, the so-called \u2018all for all,\u2019 or a complete deal in three steps. The cabinet voted unanimously on this. That\u2019s why the Prime Minister\u2019s statement about a partial deal is against the war cabinet\u2019s decision,\u201d Eisenkot told the Knesset Foreign Affairs Committee on Monday. \u201cI think this requires clarification in light of the turmoil it causes to the families of the hostages.\u201d Eisenkot, who \u2013 along with centrist opposition figure Benny Gantz \u2013 resigned from the war cabinet the week before Netanyahu dissolved it, said the remarks had damaged Israel\u2019s war objectives. \u201cThe damage is of course the failure to realize the goals of the war, and it is a fatal damage to the national strength of the State of Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are soldiers who are fighting now because they have war goals to return the hostages and therefore I think that an immediate clarification by the Prime Minister is required as to what he meant.\u201d In a short statement issued after his interview Sunday, Netanyahu\u2019s office sought to clarify his comments, saying Hamas opposes a deal, not Israel. \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu has made it clear that we will not leave Gaza until we return all 120 of our hostages, living and deceased,\u201d it said. Seeking to row back his explosive comments even further, Netanyahu on Monday told the Knesset: \u201cWe are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden welcomed. Our position has not changed.\u201d The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters condemned any suggestion of a withdrawal without securing the return of all hostages. \u201cThe end of the fighting in the Gaza Strip, without the release of the hostages, is an unprecedented national failure and a failure to meet the goals of the war,\u201d the Forum said in a statement on Monday. The prime minister has faced nationwide protests in Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the return of all hostages. On Saturday, families of the hostages took part in the ongoing\u00a0anti-government\u00a0protests, including in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Herzliya, Caesarea, Raanana, Be\u2019er Sheva, Kiryat Gat\u00a0and the town of Pardes Hanna-Karkur. Many protesters demanded the government accept the hostage release deal. Cracks also appear to be deepening between the Israeli government and its military. Netanyahu has come under increasing\u00a0pressure\u00a0from members of his\u00a0government\u00a0and Israel\u2019s allies, including the United States, to devise a strategy for the post-war governance of Gaza after Israel\u2019s devastating bombardment of the isolated enclave. In response to the prime minister\u2019s comments, Hamas said the words used by\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0show that he is only looking for a partial agreement and not an end to the war in Gaza. Netanyahu\u2019s positions are \u201ca clear confirmation of his rejection of the recent Security Council resolution, and the proposals of US President Joe Biden,\u201d Hamas said in a statement. Hamas continues to insist that any agreement include, \u201ca clear affirmation of a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\u201d Shifting north Netanyahu also told Channel 14 Television that \u201cafter the end of the intense phase, we will have the possibility to shift some of the power north, and we will do it.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, for protection purposes, and secondly, to bring our residents home as well. If we can do it politically, that would be great. If not, we will do it in another way, but we will bring everyone back home \u2013 all the residents of the north and the south,\u201d he added. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, has been carrying out deadly attacks from southern Lebanon targeting areas in northern Israel since October 8, the day after the Hamas attacks on Israel. Israel has responded to Hezbollah\u2019s attacks with strikes that have killed Hezbollah militants, among them senior commanders. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from their homes in northern Israel due to ongoing conflict. Villages across southern Lebanon have also emptied. The increase in cross-border attacks in recent weeks has intensified concerns about the possible outbreak of another full-fledged conflict in the Middle East. Israeli officials have told the US they were planning\u00a0to shift resources from southern Gaza to northern Israel in preparation for a possible offensive against the group, US officials told CNN on Wednesday. The implications of a wider war between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah could be devastating, a senior US official previously told CNN. US officials have serious concerns\u00a0that in the event of a full-blown war between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah, as the Iran-backed militant group could overwhelm Israel\u2019s air defenses\u00a0in the north \u2014 including the much-vaunted\u00a0Iron Dome\u00a0air defense system. Netanyahu was also asked in the interview if his solution to ending the conflict with Hezbollah was via agreement or war. The prime minister responded, \u201cLook, if there is an agreement, it will be an agreement according to our terms. Our terms are not ending the war, leaving Gaza, and leaving Hamas intact. I refuse to leave Hamas intact. We need to eliminate them.\u201d Israel launched its war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages. Since then, the Israeli campaign has killed more than 37,000 people, according to the ministry of health in Gaza.

{"id": "2024_06_24_weather_south-heat-wave-midwest-flood-recovery", "text": "Dangerous heat is setting its sights on millions of Americans across the South and Plains on Monday, including several communities recovering from destructive flooding over the weekend. Here\u2019s the latest. \u2022 Heat heads to the South: The unrelenting heat shifts into the South and Southern Plains on Monday and Tuesday, bringing temperatures in the mid to upper 90s. Some cities could even see 100-degree highs, including Dallas and Little Rock, Arkansas. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels in humidity and high temperatures \u2013 could top a dangerous 110 degrees in some areas. \u2022 Minnesota dam compromised: Southern Minnesota\u2019s Rapidan Dam is in \u201cimminent failure condition\u201d after this weekend\u2019s dangerous flooding, Blue Earth County Emergency Management warned Monday. The dam \u2013 about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis \u2013 was intact as of late Monday morning, but water was flowing around it. No evacuation orders were issued as of late Monday morning. \u2022 Flood-stricken communities begin recovery amid sweltering heat: Heat alerts on Monday spread over 1,000 miles from North Florida to South Dakota, which was among several states inundated by heavy rain and devastating flooding over the weekend. Heat advisories are in effect for several areas that were swamped with floodwater over the weekend, including parts of\u00a0northern Iowa, southern South Dakota, eastern Nebraska and northern Missouri and Kansas. President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Iowa after catastrophic flooding forced some communities to evacuate. \u2022 Record-breaking weekend heat: Daily high-temperature records were broken from New York to Mississippi over the weekend, including some that were more than a century old, as a brutal heat wave embraced the mid-Atlantic and I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to New York. Philadelphia hit 98 degrees on Sunday, shattering its 1888 record of 97 degrees. Both Greenville, Mississippi, and Raleigh, North Carolina, saw a record 100 degrees. People in the region can breathe a sigh of relief Monday as cooler temperatures begin to set in. \u2022 Flooding turns deadly in South Dakota: At least one person died during severe flooding in South Dakota, Governor Kristi Noem said. \u201cI want to remind everybody to remember the power of water and the flow of water, and to stay away from flooded areas,\u201d the governor warned. At least nine people were rescued from rising water in Sioux Falls, where emergency personnel reported stranded drivers and dozens of trapped vehicles. And the flood threat still isn\u2019t over \u2013 several rivers in the state are swollen with floodwater and will continue rising over the next few days, Noem said. \u2022 More than 20 rivers at major flood stage: Flood warnings remain across waterlogged areas of South Dakota, Iowa and southern Minnesota, as well as along rivers that are running well above normal. At least 23 river gauges have reached major flood stage in the area, meaning extensive flooding of buildings, main roadways, and other critical infrastructure is possible, according to the National Weather Service. That number is expected to grow as water continues to collect across creeks and streams, eventually dumping into major rivers. \u2022 \u201cMonsoon-like\u201d conditions coming to the Southwest: An influx of tropical moisture \u2013 some of which is from Tropical Storm Alberto \u2013 is bringing \u201cmonsoon-like conditions\u201d to the Southwest, the Weather Prediction Center said. Thunderstorms are possible through midweek as a result. While the rainfall may be welcomed by firefighters battling several active wildfires in the region, too much rain could trigger flooding and debris flows, making it difficult for crews to access burn areas. Where heat will go next A heat dome building over the southwestern and south-central US early this week will push temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal each afternoon in an area spanning from the West into the Southeast. High temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s are expected Monday from southern South Dakota through the Southeast. A handful of daily record high temperatures could fall in parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and a few are at risk in Mississippi. The southern tier of the country will remain the epicenter for sizzling conditions Tuesday with high temperatures in the low 100s likely in the southern Plains and Southeast. Atlanta is forecast to top out in the upper 90s both Tuesday and Wednesday, about 10 degrees above normal for late June. By Wednesday, heat will briefly shift back into some of the same areas of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast that baked last week, but it won\u2019t touch the extreme nature of last week\u2019s oven-like conditions. Temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s will return in the mid-Atlantic and 90s will return as far north as southern New England. A few daily high temperature records are in jeopardy Wednesday \u2013 including DC and Baltimore \u2013 but much of the northeast US will avoid unseasonable heat. Stormy weather maintains flood threat There will be rain chances for heavily flooded areas of the Midwest most of this week. A level 2 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms is in effect over the area Monday and Tuesday and some of these storms could unload rounds of heavy rainfall. Exactly how much rain falls and where depends on how thunderstorms develop each afternoon, but the heaviest storms could unload more than an inch of rain in a short time. That\u2019s more than enough to cause additional flooding concerns in areas that can\u2019t take much more rain. Storms are expected to roar to life each day in the late afternoon or early evening hours and remain a threat overnight. Damaging wind gusts and hail\u00a0are also threats with any severe thunderstorm early this week. After a brief break on Wednesday, additional heavy rain is possible in the same areas Thursday and Friday.

{"id": "2024_06_25_sport_england-slovenia-denmark-serbia-spt-intl", "text": "England secured top spot in Group C with a goalless draw against Slovenia on Tuesday, but another underwhelming performance throws up more questions about the Three Lions\u2019 status as one of the Euro 2024 favorites. In the other game, Denmark and Serbia drew 0-0 as the Red and Whites finished second in the group, though Slovenia\u2019s squad celebrated its historic first European Championship knockouts qualification as one of the four best third-placed teams. England enjoyed 71% possession but did nothing to respond to the criticism leveled at the team in the days since another lethargic and fearful performance against Denmark. The team created few real chances of note and were again met by boos at full-time from traveling England fans. Gareth Southgate\u2019s side did show improvements in the second half after the introductions of Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer, but the Three Lions never really threatened Atl\u00e9tico Madrid keeper Jan Oblak. Worries for England? Slovenia knew a draw could be enough to see it through to the knockout stages for the first time in history but would be reliant on results elsewhere going its way. England, meanwhile, had been heavily criticized for two poor performances to open Euro 2024: a narrow 1-0 win over Serbia and a 1-1 draw with Denmark. The team\u2019s half-hearted pressing and its overly cautious approach have been the primary sources of frustrations for England fans, but Southgate\u2019s side had the chance to be more free-spirited against Slovenia given results on Monday ensured the Three Lions a place in the last 16. England thought it had taken the lead after 20 minutes when Bukayo Saka tapped in at the far post from Phil Foden\u2019s square pass, but the Manchester City forward was offside in the build-up. All in all, however, it was another dismal half of football from England, which enjoyed the vast majority of possession without causing Slovenia any real problems. The Slovenians looked comfortable on the ball during their few brief spells of possession and got into some dangerous areas, but a lack of quality meant those rare forays forward came to nothing. Southgate has so far been unable to find a midfield pairing that\u2019s worked for him at Euro 2024, this time opting to start Conor Gallagher alongside Declan Rice instead of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Gallagher only lasted the first half, however, with Southgate opting to bring on Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo. There was a slight improvement in England\u2019s intensity to begin the second half, but Slovenia still looked comfortable allowing the Three Lions to pass the ball around in front of them. Chelsea forward Cole Palmer made his long awaited debut at this tournament, coming on for Saka after 70 minutes, but there was little change in England\u2019s approach going forward. Rice and Foden exchanged a neat one-two that resulted in the former flashing a shot across goal, but it was never close enough to trouble Oblak. Palmer had perhaps England\u2019s best chance towards the end after being found by Harry Kane, but his tame effort from the edge of the area was easily held by the Atleti keeper. England\u2019s slight improvement in the second half, though, will likely have Southgate rethinking his starting lineup ahead of the last 16.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/england-slovenia-denmark-serbia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

The company had worked with IBM to develop and test AI-driven, voice-automated ordering at some of its restaurants. The fast food giant says it\u2019s still working on AI-related solutions at a time when its rivals are making similar investments. It plans to shut off the technology in restaurants participating in the test \u201cno later than July 26, 2024,\u201d according to reporting from trade publication Restaurant Business. \u201cIBM remains a trusted partner and we will still utilize many of their products across our global System,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in an email sent to franchisees and shared with CNN. But the company suggested it will look at AI partners other than IBM. McDonald\u2019s and IBM launched their partnership in 2021, announcing the development of Automated Order Taking (AOT) technology to create a more convenient and simplified ordering experience for its customers and restaurant teams as a part of its \u201cAccelerating the Arches\u201d growth plan.

{"id": "2024_06_22_europe_balkan-states-heat-power-outage-minister-intl", "text": "A major power outage hit Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania and most of Croatia\u2019s coast on Friday, disrupting businesses, shutting down traffic lights and leaving people sweltering without air conditioning in the middle of a heatwave. Montenegro\u2019s energy minister said the shutdown was caused by a sudden increase in power consumption brought on by\u00a0high temperatures, and by the heat itself overloading systems. Power distribution is linked across the Balkans for transfers and trading. \u201cThis was just waiting to happen in this heat,\u201d Gentiana, a 24-year-old student in Montenegro\u2019s capital Podgorica, told Reuters. Temperatures hit 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) across the southeastern European region. Electricity and wifi networks went down from around 1 p.m. (1100 GMT), officials and social media users said. Suppliers in the four countries said they started restoring supply by mid-afternoon and power was largely back by the evening. At the start of the blackout, traffic light failures caused gridlock in Bosnia\u2019s capital Sarajevo and the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar, Reuters reporters said. Many lost water in Podgorica as pumps stopped working, locals reported. Air conditioners shut down and ice cream melted in tourist shops. Cars also ground to a halt in the Croatian coastal city of Split, state TV HRT reported. Ambulance sirens rang out across the city, it added. \u201cThe failure occurred as a result of a heavy load on the network, a sudden increase in power consumption due to high temperature and the high temperatures themselves,\u201d Montenegro\u2019s energy minister, Sasa Mujovic, said in a TV broadcast. Experts were still trying to identify where the malfunction originated, he added. Risk remains Montenegro\u2019s Vijesti TV said a fire had been spotted in a 400KW transmission line in a rugged area along the border with Bosnia - though it was not immediately clear if this could have been the cause of outages or in some way related to them. The report cited unnamed sources from the electric transmission company CGES which, it said, would need helicopters to access the site. Albanian Energy Minister Belinda Balluku said there had been a breakdown in an interconnector between Albania and Greece and he had heard there had been similar circumstances in Montenegro and parts of Croatia and Bosnia. A full investigation would take time, but early analysis suggested that \u201cbig volumes of power in the transmission system at the moment and very high temperatures in record levels have created this technical problem,\u201d Balluku added in a video address. Power in Albania was restored within half an hour, but the country remained at a high risk of further shutdowns as power usage and heat levels were still high, he said. Shifts in the region\u2019s energy supplies have put strains on its transmission systems,\u00a0industry officials say. Western Balkan nations have seen a boom in solar energy investment, meant to ease a power crisis that had threatened a shift away from coal. But the infrastructure is not prepared for new energy feeds, the president of North Macedonia\u2019s Energy Regulatory Commission and other industry figures told Reuters in April last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/europe/balkan-states-heat-power-outage-minister-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_france-debate-attal-bardella-bompard-intl", "text": "Three of France\u2019s highest-profile candidates in the country\u2019s upcoming legislative elections sparred in the first major debate of the campaign on Tuesday. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal squared off against Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally, and Manuel Bompard of the leftist alliance dubbed the New Popular Front in a wide-ranging, sometimes chaotic two-hour affair. Attal, 35, and Bardella, 28, are two of the country\u2019s youngest and most popular politicians.\u00a0After serving in various positions in Macron\u2019s government, Attal was named the youngest prime minister in French history earlier this year. Bardella led the National Rally to a dominant showing at the European elections on June 9. Bompard, 38, does not have the same sort of name recognition or leadership position. He was elected to the French National Assembly in 2022 representing Marseille and is a member of the far-left political party France Unbowed. None of the three candidates appeared to land any knockout blows or move the needle enough to sway the opinion of voters. Bardella didn\u2019t appear to sufficiently address criticisms that his party platform is short of specifics. Attal didn\u2019t seem to give angry voters a reason to opt for continuity. And Bompard\u2019s presence on the stage served as a reminder to voters that the left has not yet decided who will lead them if they win the vote. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a punchline that was striking or impactful,\u201d said Jean Petaux, a political science and expert in French politics. French voters will head to the polls on June 30 and July 7 for a two-round snap election that President Emmanuel Macron called after the National Rally crushed his centrist political movement during the European elections. The move took the French political establishment and society at large by surprise. Not even Attal was aware he was about to lose his job until shortly before the announcement. Macron framed the decision as an exercise in democracy, an opportunity for the French to clarify who they want running the country. But it\u2019s incredibly risky. Macron is gambling that the higher stakes national vote, which draws greater turnout and more scrutiny than European contests, will see the French spurn the National Rally\u2019s anti-immigrant, euroskeptic agenda in favor of more moderate political forces. He\u2019s also assuming that French voters use the runoff, as they have historically, to keep the far right out of power. As things stand, however, Macron will lose his bet. Opinion polls conducted since the snap elections were announced show the National Rally\u2019s momentum has continued to hold, while France\u2019s numerous left-leaning parties have put aside their various ideological differences to jointly field candidates across the country. A survey released on Sunday by pollster IFOP found the National Rally leading all parties with the support of 35% of voters. The New Popular Front, the leftist alliance, came in second with 30% and Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble dropped to third with 20%. If those results hold, the French legislature would be thrown into a state of political paralysis. No party would amass enough votes to meet the 289-seat threshold for an absolute majority in the 577-seat lower chamber, the National Assembly. Macron\u2019s party is already governing without a majority after its poorer-than-expected showing in the 2022 legislative elections, forcing it to either seek out coalitions to pass legislation or use a constitutional tool to force through new laws \u2013 including last year\u2019s controversial pension reform that raised the retirement age to 64 for most workers \u2013 without a vote. But falling behind to either the left or right could be the death knell to his agenda.

It\u2019s the first time in history that the Burschen have finished top of their group at the European Championship, while the Netherlands also book their place in the last 16 as one of the four best third-placed teams. Donyell Malen\u2019s own goal gave Austria a deserved lead after just six minutes, only for Cody Gakpo to level the score two minutes into the second half. Romano Schmid\u2019s header restored the lead for Ralf Rangnick\u2019s men just 12 minutes later, but the Oranje bounced back again thanks to Memphis Depay\u2019s brilliant improvised finish. However, Austria was relentless and eventually got what proved to be the winning goal as Marcel Sabitzer broke through the Dutch defense and finished smartly high into the roof of the net just 10 minutes from time. France, meanwhile, took the lead over Poland 10 minutes into the second half thanks to Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s penalty \u2013 the French superstar\u2019s first ever European Championship goal. Poland was given the chance to equalize with a penalty of its own 10 minutes from time after a video assistant referee (VAR) review, but Robert Lewandowski saw his penalty saved by Mike Maignan. However, VAR intervened again and ruled Maignan had moved off his line, allowing the Bar\u00e7a forward to score at the second attempt. The draw means France enters what is widely considered the more difficult half of the knockout bracket, alongside Spain, Germany and Portugal. Dutch despair The Netherlands were unconvincing in their opening two group games, a late 2-1 win over Poland and a stale 0-0 draw with France. After narrowly losing 1-0 to France in its opener, a much-improved Austria overwhelmed Poland with its high intensity, fast-paced soccer in game two and did so again to the Netherlands in the opening minutes of Tuesday\u2019s match. The Burschen were rewarded for their bright start with a goal after just five minutes when Netherlands winger Malen turned the ball into his own net as he tried to cut out Marko Arnautovi\u0107\u2019s cross. So dominant had Rangnick\u2019s men been in the opening 20 minutes, that fans started early with chants of \u201cOl\u00e9\u201d every time the team passed the ball. It was proving to be an enjoyable afternoon in the Berlin sun for Austria fans \u2013 less so for Malen. The Dortmund forward squandered a brilliant opportunity to make amends for his own goal but scuffed his effort wide of the post when clean through on goal. Arnautovi\u0107 should have doubled Austria\u2019s lead 10 minutes before half-time when Sabitzer\u2019s cross fortuitously ended up at his feet, but the Inter Milan forward failed to even make contact with the ball. Austria had apparently taken a shellshocked Oranje by surprise with its fast start and was passing the ball around with ease for long periods. Whatever manager Ronald Koeman, who looked frustrated throughout the first period, said to his players at the break had the desired effect. The Netherlands began the second half like a different team entirely and leveled the scoreline just moments after the restart as Gakpo brilliantly finished off a blistering counterattack, cutting onto his right foot and bending the ball into the far corner. But the Dutch delight was short lived \u2013 12 minutes to be exact \u2013 as Schmid got on the end of Florian Grillitsch\u2019s cross with a diving header to restore Austria\u2019s lead. Koeman opted to bring on super-sub Wout Weghorst, who saved the Oranje with a late winner over Poland and also with an equalizer against Argentina in the 2022 World Cup. His presence had an almost immediate impact, heading the ball down to Depay who took the ball brilliantly on his thigh and torso before volleying acrobatically past keeper Patrick Pentz. But again the Dutch traded joy for despair, this time after only five minutes. The entire Dutch defense allowed Austria captain Sabitzer to roam freely into the box and fire the ball over Bart Verbruggen. Following the huge win, Austria\u2019s entire squad and backroom staff lined up arm-in-arm in front of thousands of fans inside the Olympiastadion, sharing the historic moment together. But while the Austrians will be riding high going into the knockout stages, Koeman and his Netherlands team have plenty of questions to answer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/euro-2024-austria-netherlands-group-d-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_world_julian-assange-plea-deal-hearing-intl", "text": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will walk free for the first time in 12 years after a US judge signs off on his unexpected plea deal on Wednesday morning. In a stunning turn of events, the 52-year-old Australian was released from a high-security prison in London on Monday afternoon and had already boarded a private jet to leave the United Kingdom before the world even knew of his agreement with the US government. He appeared in a US courtroom on the Northern Mariana Islands to formalize the agreement, officially pleading guilty to conspiring unlawfully to\u00a0obtain and disseminate classified information over his alleged role in one of the largest breaches of classified material in US military history. \u201cI am, in fact,\u00a0guilty of the charge,\u201d Assange told the court in Saipan. The remote Pacific island chain is a US territory, located around 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) west of Hawaii. Assange - who has long held a deep mistrust of the US, even going so far as accusing it of allegedly plotting his assassination - was hesitant about stepping foot in the continental US, and so prosecutors asked for all proceedings to take place in a day in a US federal court based in Saipan, the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands. Justice Department prosecutors also said the court on the islands made logistical sense as it is closer to Australia, where Assange will ultimately travel to following the conclusion of his legal battle. At the start of the plea deal hearing the judge reminded Assange that he was back in the United States and that this court was the \u201csmallest, youngest, and furthest from nations capital.\u201d Assange looked relaxed in the courtroom, wearing a black jacket and brown tie, while next to his attorneys. Asked by the judge, Honorable Ramona Manglona, to describe what he had done to be charged, Assange said: \u201cWorking as a journalist,\u00a0I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information. I believe that the First Amendment protected that activity\u2026 I believe the First Amendment and the Espionage Act are in contradiction with each other, but I accept that it would be difficult to win such a case given all these circumstances.\u201d Assange and his whistleblower website rose to global prominence in 2010 after a string of leaks from former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The website posted a video showing a US military helicopter firing on and killing two journalists and several Iraqi civilians in 2007. Several months later, it disclosed more than 90,000 classified Afghan war documents dating back to 2004. Later in 2010, he was wanted in Sweden to answer questions over allegations of sexual assault that had emerged. Two years later, Assange sought political asylum within the Ecuadorian embassy in west London. He remained there for almost seven years until the Metropolitan Police entered his safe haven in 2019 acting on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department. British officers moved in after Ecuador withdrew his asylum and invited authorities into the embassy, citing Assange\u2019s bad behavior. For years, the US argued that the self-appointed champion of free speech endangered lives and posed a threat to national security. He had originally been facing 18 criminal charges\u00a0relating to his organization\u2019s release of massive troves of sensitive information into the public domain. Instead, as part of the agreement brokered with the Justice Department, Assange entered a guilty plea to a single criminal charge. His punishment was 62 months in prison, but he will not spend any time behind bars in the US, as the sentence equates to the five years he fought extradition while incarcerated at London\u2019s Belmarsh prison. The deal brokered with the US is the final act of a 14-year legal drama that has spanned continents, though it was not immediately clear why it reached a resolution now. Australian officials have been pushing diplomatic angles for some time. It was widely thought that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had raised Assange\u2019s case when he visited the White House last October. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, the Australian leader said, \u201cregardless of\u00a0the views that people have about\u00a0Mr. Assange\u2019s activities,\u00a0the case has dragged on for too\u00a0long. There is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia.\u201d US President Joe\u00a0Biden\u00a0had in recent months alluded to a possible deal pushed by Australian government officials to return\u00a0Assange\u00a0to Australia. However, the administration distanced itself from the developments on Tuesday. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told CNN Tuesday, \u201cThis was an independent decision made by the Department of Justice and there was no\u00a0White House involvement in the plea deal decision.\u201d Regardless, Assange\u2019s wife, Stella, said Tuesday that she was \u201celated\u201d at the news her husband was free from Belmarsh. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s just incredible. I don\u2019t know. It kind of feels like it\u2019s not real,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program. She spoke from Australia, where she flew with their two children on Sunday morning before Assange\u2019s release. She said she had not yet told their young children why they had traveled to their father\u2019s homeland. Assange\u2019s half-brother, Gabriel Shipton told CNN that \u201cIt\u2019s a momentous day\u201d for Assange now that he\u2019s been released from a British prison after accepting the plea deal with the US. He added that his brother\u2019s work had changed the world. He said Assange is \u201cexcited to be a free man again\u201d and looking forward to doing normal things he hasn\u2019t been able to do after being held in a maximum-security prison for the last five years. He said his brother enjoys Australian bird watching, swimming in the ocean and sharing a meal with his wife and children. \u201cThe work that WikiLeaks and the work that Julian did \u2013 it\u2019s historical now,\u201d Shipton said. \u201cThe collateral murder video that exposed Reuters journalists being killed by a helicopter gunship in Baghdad. I think those are historical moments, historical publications that went all around the world, torture in Guantanamo Bay, as well as corruption in the banking system, toxic waste dumping. This is a legacy of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange,\u201d he added. Once the WikiLeaks founder touches down in Australia, one thing on his to-do list will be paying off his government for the ride home. Assange will owe $520,000 for the charter flight, according to the international campaign that called for his release. To cover the purported expenses as well as other funds for his recovery, the campaign has launched an appeal, asking supporters for donations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/world/julian-assange-plea-deal-hearing-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

Slater, 19, went missing after attending the NRG festival in the south of the island, and was last heard from between 8 and 9 a.m. local time (3-4 a.m. ET) on June 17, according to a GoFundMe fundraising campaign set up to help find him. The campaign was organized by a friend of Slater\u2019s named Lucy Mae, who said she had left the festival before Slater on Sunday. Slater called her around 8.30 a.m. local time the next day and said he was \u201clost in the mountains\u201d and his phone only had 1% battery, according to the fundraiser. The page includes a map showing Slater\u2019s last known location, in the Teno Rural Park in northwestern Tenerife, around 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the festival site. According to the fundraiser, Slater told Lucy Mae he left the festival with two men he met there and traveled with them to a remote location. Spain\u2019s Guardia Civil, which is leading the search for the teenager, posted a video on X showing officers searching dry, mountainous terrain and flying over rocky ravines in a helicopter. CNN has contacted the Guardia Civil for comment on the search. Police from Slater\u2019s home region of Lancashire, northern England, said they had been in contact with the Guardia Civil. \u201cWhilst this case falls outside the jurisdiction of UK policing, we have made an offer of support to the Guardia Civil to see if they need any additional resources,\u201d the Lancashire Police Force said in a statement published Friday. \u201cThey have confirmed that at this time they are satisfied that they have the resources they need, but that offer remains open and they will contact us should that position change.\u201d In a statement Monday, the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign Office confirmed to CNN that it is aware of Slater\u2019s case. \u201cWe are supporting the family of a British man who is missing in Spain and are in contact with the local authorities,\u201d said a spokesperson. On Saturday, NRG festival released a statement on Slater\u2019s disappearance. \u201cThat such a devastating situation has arisen has deeply affected us all,\u201d the festival said in a post on Instagram. \u201cWe have been able to give some practical support to the members of Jay\u2019s family who have come to Tenerife in such difficult circumstances, and we are inspired by their resilience and determination.\u201d Tenerife is part of the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago that sits in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Africa.

Kenya is in the grip of nationwide protests against proposed tax hikes, culminating in Tuesday\u2019s \u201ctotal shutdown\u201d of the country, which quickly turned violent as police used tear gas and live rounds on protesters. The controversial finance bill has unleashed widespread protests movement vowing for \u201c7 Days of Rage.\u201d Last week, the government scrapped some tax increases, including a proposed 16% value-added tax on bread along with taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil and mobile money transfers.

Kenyan police were also seen beating and later arresting\u00a0some paramedics\u00a0who were helping injured protesters. During a nationwide address after parliament was set alight, Ruto said the events on Tuesday were a grave threat to \u201cnational security\u201d and that the conversation around the bill had been \u201chijacked by dangerous people.\u201d \u201cIt is not in order, or even conceivable, that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives, and the institutions established under our Constitution and expect to go scot-free,\u201d the president said, adding that democratic expression and crime must be isolated from one another. Kenya\u2019s defense ministry said the military has been deployed to support the country\u2019s police services as human rights and civil society groups criticize the heavy-handed response by the police on Tuesday. It was reported that at least five people were shot dead and around 31 were injured during Tuesday\u2019s protests. Of these, 13 were hit with live bullets, four with rubber bullets, and three with launcher canisters, according to a joint statement by Amnesty International Kenya, the Kenya Medical Association, the Law Society of Kenya, and Police Reforms Working Group Kenya. The joint statement also accused the police of shooting at a medical emergency center located at a church. CNN has reached out to the\u00a0Kenyan police for comment. \u201cThe use of live bullets must now stop,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDespite the assurance by the government that the right to assembly would be protected and facilitated, today\u2019s protests have spiraled into violence. Human rights observers and medical officers have reported several incidents of human rights violation.\u201d The demonstrations, sparked by the Finance Bill 2024, have seen citizens rally under the banner of \u201c7 Days of Rage,\u201d as the nation faces more days of upheaval. The dramatic scenes that unfolded in the nation\u2019s capital saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from Parliament in the melee.  Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from Parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported. Internet monitoring site\u00a0NetBlocks reported a \u201cmajor disruption\u201d to internet connectivity Tuesday. Nairobi\u2019s City Hall, the office of the Governor of Nairobi, was also set on fire, live visuals from CNN affiliate Citizen TV showed. A fire could be seen blazing through a lower-ground window, with other windows also emitting smoke. According to Citizen TV, some people were seen removing furniture, including chairs, from the building. Vehicles parked at Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court, which is close to the City Hall, were also set on fire. Earlier on Tuesday, Auma Obama, the half-sister of former United States President Barack Obama, was teargassed by police during an interview with CNN live on air, while protesting\u00a0against the bill. \u201cI can\u2019t even see anymore, we\u2019re being teargassed,\u201d Obama said in dramatic footage captured by a CNN team on the ground. Obama, a\u00a0Kenyan-British activist, was speaking to CNN alongside a group of young protesters when the group was teargassed in Nairobi. A spokesman for former President Obama declined to comment on the tear gas incident on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m here because look at what\u2019s happening. Young\u00a0Kenyans are demonstrating for their rights. They are demonstrating with flags and banners,\u201d Obama said. Accusations of abductions Security forces have also been accused of abducting prominent Kenyans, particularly those who have large social media followings Amnesty International\u00a0Kenya\u00a0says it is investigating the whereabouts of up to 12 people who were \u201cabducted in the middle of night\u201d ahead of Tuesday\u2019s planned protests. The list includes bloggers, content creators, human rights defenders, a doctor, and a parliamentary staffer, Amnesty\u00a0Kenya\u00a0executive director Ir\u0169ng\u0169 Houghton told CNN. \u201cWe are horrified by some of the testimonies we have heard over the last 24 hours. We have about 12 people unaccounted for who have been picked up, in many cases, by people who are uniformed or not uniformed,\u201d Houghton said, adding that that they had not received legal assistance and their families didn\u2019t know their whereabouts. \u201cWe are now seeing not just abductions but disappearances,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to the Kenyan police for comment. Kenya\u2019s opposition leader Raila Odinga called for the government to \u201cimmediately stop the violence its agencies are meting out on citizens.\u201d In a statement on X, Odinga also called for the arrest of police officers who are alleged to have shot and killed protesters, as well as for the immediate withdrawal of the country\u2019s controversial finance bill. International leaders urged for calm on Tuesday. The United Nations Secretary General called on Kenya\u2019s police and security forces to \u201cexercise restraint,\u201d his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday, adding that he was \u201cdeeply concerned over the reported violence that we\u2019ve seen.\u201d The African Union Commission called on all stakeholders to refrain from further violence. A statement from the body said its chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat urges \u201call stakeholders to exercise calm and refrain from further violence. The chairperson also appeals to national stakeholders to engage in constructive dialogue to address the contentious issues that led to the protests in the supreme interest of Kenya.\u201d The protests come as\u00a0Kenya\u2019s standing gains global prominence as US President Joe Biden designated\u00a0the country a \u201cmajor non-NATO ally\u201d on Monday, marking the first time a sub-Saharan African nation has received this status. In May, Biden announced his decision to elevate\u00a0Kenya\u00a0to this designation while hosting President Ruto at the White House for a grand state visit, celebrating 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations.

{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_unauthorized-hajj-muslim-pilgrims-death-intl", "text": "Abdelzaher Abdo Salem, 81, decided to make the pilgrimage to Mecca from Egypt after fulfilling a mission to get his youngest son Mahmoud married two years ago. \u201cThis was his last wish,\u201d his son Mahmoud said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t perform the Hajj before that because of the lack of money, and because I was going to get married, and there were a lot of expenses.\u201d Due to the high cost of Hajj through official channels \u2013 150,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,091), in addition to plane tickets \u2013 Salem had resorted to a representative of an unlicensed company to organize the trip, at a lower cost of around 100,000 Egyptian pounds ($2,061). But Salem never made it back to Egypt. He was among the more than 1,300 pilgrims who died during this year\u2019s Hajj as temperatures in Saudi Arabia reached record levels. Saudi authorities said that the vast majority of those who died were not authorized to conduct the rituals. The tragedy, resulting in one of the highest Hajj death tolls in years, has brought attention to the shadowy industry of unauthorized pilgrimage agents. These agents profit from Muslims\u2019 desire to fulfill their religious obligations by sidestepping official procedures, leading pilgrims on potentially hazardous journeys. Saudi authorities said many of those who died \u201cwalked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort\u201d as the temperature reached a record 125 degrees Fahrenheit (51.7 degrees Celsius). For Salem, the process to get to Mecca involved obtaining a personal visit visa to Saudi Arabia instead of a special Hajj visa that would authorize him to access the holy cities and pilgrim facilities, including air-conditioned\u00a0venues and medical services. A visit visa however bars entry into Mecca, so its holders are forced to take a desert path to access the holy city, often on foot. Salem, who was traveling with his wife, had been promised by a representative of the Egyptian travel agency that a bus would be provided to transport the group. However, there was no transport for them to and from Mount Arafat, his son Mahmoud said, so the two had to walk towards Mina, around 8 miles away, to complete the \u201cstoning the devil\u201d ritual. On the way, Salem\u2019s wife became exhausted and sat down to rest. Determined to complete the rituals, her husband continued walking. He promised his wife he would return, said Mahmoud. But contact with Salem was subsequently lost. His wife searched for him for five days until she found his name on the list of deceased at Al-Ma\u2019aisam Hospital in Mecca. \u201cOur mother informed us of the news via a voice message on WhatsApp. The news was a tragedy for us,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cOur mother is there, devastated, and no one is there to comfort her.\u201d A lucrative industry Each year, Saudi authorities issue licenses permitting legal access to Mecca for pilgrims. These licenses provide access to air-conditioned transportation and accommodation facilities for worshipers. However, the number of licenses is limited \u2013 1.8 million this year \u2013  and they can cost several thousand dollars. Every country is allocated a number of licenses that is proportional to its Muslim population. This process excludes those who cannot afford the license or are not included in the allocation. Hajj is a once-in-a-lifetime religious obligation for every able-bodied Muslim. Many Muslims wait their entire lives to make the journey, often delaying the pilgrimage into their old age until they have saved enough money and fulfilled their family obligations. However, millions are left disappointed when they cannot secure a spot through official channels. Each country traditionally gets one Hajj license for every 1,000 Muslims \u2013 that\u2019s a 0.1% rate. But according to Egyptian officials cited in state media, Egypt, a Muslim-majority country of 110 million, was allocated 50,000 Hajj licenses this year, a rate of approximately 0.05%. This has given rise to a lucrative industry of travel agencies that promise to get pilgrims to Saudi Arabia unofficially, often with assurances of transport and accommodation that may not be fulfilled or are below standard. Coupled with the extreme heat this year, this spelled tragedy for many pilgrims. While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year\u2019s gathering was held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom. Atef Aglan, a member of the Egyptian Travel Agents Association, says there is a lack of awareness about the procedures of the Hajj among many Egyptians, which allows inexperienced tour operators and some mosque imams to exploit the poor, promising a cheaper Hajj without the appropriate visa or accommodation and transport. He proposes criminalizing the phenomenon because \u201cit has become a profession for those with no profession.\u201d \u201cThis is premeditated murder because this broker knows that the temperatures are above 50 degrees (Celsius), and he knows that these people do not have decent accommodation,\u201d Aglan said. A Hajj package from a licensed agency costs pilgrims approximately $4,760,\u00a0while unauthorized trips cost around $3,700, Aglan says. The average annual household income in Egypt is $1,429 as of 2019, according to the latest figures. Lack of adequate care for pilgrims The tragedy has also underscored Saudi authorities\u2019 inability to curb unauthorized pilgrimages or provide adequate care for those who undertake such journeys, which have been taking place for years. It is unclear how many unauthorized pilgrims made it to this year\u2019s Hajj, but Saudi news outlet Al Sharq Al Awsat reported Tuesday that 141,000 such pilgrims received free medical treatment during the Hajj season. That amounts to approximately 8% of the 1.8 million pilgrims this year. In recent decades, the sheer size of Hajj crowds has been a factor in the number of\u00a0deadly incidents\u00a0during the pilgrimage, including a stampede that killed more than 700 people in 2015. Recognizing the economic potential of religious tourism, Saudi Arabia plans to increase Hajj pilgrim numbers to 5 million by 2030 from just under 2 million now. But some pilgrims have lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of the Hajj. Even those on official tours can spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in searing heat. Hania Hassan Salama, 65, a homemaker from Egypt, asked her children to draw a mural of the Kaaba on the wall of their house, a tradition in Egypt to announce a pilgrimage. The day the mural was completed, the children lost contact with her. The family was later informed that she had died, her relatives told CNN. Salama had purchased a Hajj package from a licensed tour operator. Her nephew Mustafa Mohammed said responsibility for the large number of deaths partly lies with Saudi authorities. \u201cThis year there was negligence, medical negligence. People were dying in the street and no one was helping them,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cEven if some people went on a visa not designated for Hajj, they do not deserve to be left to die in the street without finding medical help.\u201d Two other pilgrims who recently returned from Hajj told CNN there were insufficient medics or basic facilities to protect worshipers from the effects of the sweltering heat in Saudi Arabia last week. Even those pilgrims who made the journey through official channels said authorities failed to provide enough water, shade or medical support to worshipers. Some\u00a0witnesses have told CNN\u00a0of how they saw worshipers losing consciousness and walked past bodies covered in white cloth. A 44-year-old Indonesian man who only wished to be referred to as Ahmad, recalled seeing many dying from the heat. \u201cAlong the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom (white fabric) cloth.\u201d CNN has reached out to Saudi authorities regarding the reportedly inadequate response to this year\u2019s heat and has yet to hear back. Clamping down on unauthorized pilgrimage Before this year\u2019s Hajj season started, Saudi authorities warned pilgrims against using agents selling unauthorized Hajj packages and had been in contact with other governments in an effort to crack down on the trend. Authorities had also arrested some illegal agents and\u00a0issued warnings about penalties for those found to assist unauthorized pilgrims. Ahead of the pilgrimage this month, Director of Public Security and Head of the Hajj Security Committee, Lieutenant General Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Bassami, laid out efforts to crack down on unauthorized pilgrims in a televised address, saying \u201cthe security of the pilgrims is a red line.\u201d Regional papers subsequently said that more than 300,000 people had been barred from performing the rites as a result. Since the tragedy, Egyptian authorities appear to be clamping down on unauthorized agencies. The government has ordered the revocation of the licenses of 16 Hajj tourism companies involved in making unauthorized pilgrimages to Mecca and has referred their managers to the public prosecutor. Salem, the 81-year-old Egyptian who died during the Hajj, was buried in the Al-Baqi cemetery in Medina, Saudi Arabia according to an Islamic tradition that a pilgrim is buried in the holy land if he dies during the pilgrimage. His wife plans to return to Cairo Friday after completing the rituals. Until she returns, Mahmoud said the family \u201cis trying to contact her to calm and comfort her, and to urge her to take care of herself because she is there alone.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/unauthorized-hajj-muslim-pilgrims-death-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

The organizers of the retreat asked Bahamian police to investigate, according to a statement from the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat obtained by CNN on Tuesday. The retreat learned of Casey\u2019s disappearance Thursday when she failed to attend morning classes, according to the statement. She was last seen late on the evening of June 19 and the \u201corganization has also advised the US Embassy as well as Taylor Casey\u2019s family,\u201d the statement said.

{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor", "text": "Victor Miller, 42, recently filed paperwork to run for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, but it wasn\u2019t exactly for him: He listed the name of a customized AI chatbot to appear on the ballot. He argued that the chatbot, named VIC \u2013 for \u201cvirtual integrated citizen\u201d \u2013 would use technology from artificial intelligence company OpenAI to make all political decisions and help govern the city. (VIC is not affiliated with a political party.) AI has \u201chelped me in my life personally \u2026 such as helping me with my resume,\u201d Miller told CNN. \u201cI think it could add a layer to help a town. I really want to see that happen.\u201d On Tuesday, however, OpenAI told CNN it shut down Miller\u2019s access to the tool that was being used to interact with and persuade voters. Using ChatGPT in this way, according to the company, is against its policies. AI is making politics even more complicated as government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use AI tools responsibly, and the tech is advancing faster than social, legal and regulatory guardrails. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action against these uses of our technology for violating our policies against political campaigning,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told CNN. On its website, OpenAI states it prohibits \u201cengaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics.\u201d Miller said he was motivated to create VIC after he was denied access to city records about policies and procedures because he made his request anonymously. \u201cIf I was able to ask AI and interact with this new intelligence, it would have known the law and I would have gotten the records,\u201d he said. The city did not respond to request for comment on the denial of records, but Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray told CNN in a statement that he is \u201cclosely\u201d monitoring Miller\u2019s bid for mayor. \u201cWyoming law is clear that, to run for office, one must be a \u2018qualified elector,\u2019 which necessitates being a real person,\u201d Gray said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, an AI bot is not a qualified elector.\u201d He also suggested the chatbot is essentially a fig leaf for a Miller candidacy. Gray said he wrote a letter to the Cheyenne municipal clerk raising his concerns about the bid. Although the public-facing version of VIC has been removed by OpenAI, Miller said it still works on his own ChatGPT account. He plans to bring it, along with a microphone, to a local Cheyenne library and give voters the opportunity to directly ask it questions via its voice-to-text feature. OpenAI told CNN it also took action against another candidate in the UK who was using its AI models to help campaign for Parliament. Steve Endacott, chairman of an AI company called Neural Voice, answers questions from voters via AI Steve, a chatbot, on his site. He is running as an independent. Endacott did not respond to a request for comment. His website offered a ChatGPT chatbot where voters were able to leave opinions and help create policies. If a voter asked the tool a question about AI Steve\u2019s policies and it didn\u2019t have an answer, it would conduct a search and create a policy suggestion. (While his website continues to operate, the tool is no longer powered by ChatGPT.) \u2018Gimmick is the right word\u2019 Although AI chatbots are getting smarter, some experts told CNN the technology should never substitute for human judgment in running any part of government. \u201cWhen it comes to AI now and what it will be like in the future, it should never be used to make automated decisions,\u201d said Jen Golbeck, a professor at the College of Information Sciences at the University of Maryland. \u201cAI has always been designed for decision support \u2013 it gives some data to help a human make decisions but is not set up to make decisions by itself.\u201d The emergence of AI political candidates also comes amid growing concerns about how the spread of misinformation could impact elections. Earlier this year, for example, a fake recording of a candidate in Slovakia saying he rigged the election went viral. Golbeck said, however, that there may be a place for AI in politics when it comes to helping with various tasks, such as answering forms from constituents or directing how to get problems solved. \u201cYou may be able to train a chatbot with all of the knowledge found in an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the decision making should always be left to humans.\u201d David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, agreed, noting the people behind an AI candidacy are leaning into \u201ca cultural moment\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. \u201cGimmick is the right word for it,\u201d Karpf told CNN. \u201cChatGPT is not qualified to run your government.\u201d Karpf said he doesn\u2019t believe lawmakers need to make formal legislation around AI chatbots running for office because \u201cno one is going to vote for an AI chatbot to run a city.\u201d Karpf believes that the timing of these cases is noteworthy, too. \u201cWe have a very serious election coming up, and I don\u2019t mind levity in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is: We should laugh for a minute and get back to work.\u201d But Miller said he hopes the attention around his efforts inspires more AI candidates in the months ahead. \u201cI think this can expand beyond the mayor and Parliament, and [reach the whole] world,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-gaza-children-starvation-malnutrition-intl", "text": "Younis lays disorientated on a green mattress in\u00a0Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza. His long brown eyelashes rest delicately on his pale sunken face, as he drifts in and out of sleep. The 9-year-old Palestinian boy lies in his mother\u2019s arms, clearly wasted from severe malnutrition and suffering from dehydration. His blue jogging bottoms hang off his emaciated legs, as his tiny ribcage protrudes from his billowy orange T-shirt. \u201cI call on people with conscience to help me find health care for my son, so that he can go back to normal,\u201d his mother, Ghanima Juma\u2019a, told CNN last week at the hospital in Khan Younis. \u201cI am losing my son in front of my eyes.\u201d Two months ago, the family was forced to flee the southern city of Rafah as Israel ramped up its attacks there. These days, they struggle to survive, living along the polluted coastline of Asda\u2019a \u2014 near the Al-Mawasi tent camp \u2014 where they cannot find enough food, water, or even shade from the Gaza heat. \u201cWe have to keep moving from one area to the other because of the war and the invasion\u2026 Life is difficult,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a tent over our heads.\u201d Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has depleted the territory\u2019s health system, leaving staff unable to treat malnourished children. Doctors told CNN they are being forced to turn away parents begging for baby milk, unable to even triage young patients with chronic illnesses compounded by severe hunger. And as Israel continues its siege on Gaza,\u00a0preventing aid groups getting enough food into the enclave, parents say they have no choice but to watch their children starve to death.\u00a0More than eight months of bombardment has shredded infrastructure, wiped out communities and laid waste to entire neighborhoods. Sanitation systems \u2014\u00a0already stressed by water shortages from extreme heat \u2014\u00a0have been heavily destroyed, according to\u00a0the UN, diminishing access to clean water. A report published Tuesday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition, warned that almost all of Gaza will\u00a0face famine\u00a0within the next three months. The UN\u2019s food agency earlier warned that southern Gaza could soon see the same \u201ccatastrophic levels of hunger\u201d recorded previously\u00a0in the north,\u00a0where Israel concentrated its military offensive in the early days of the war. At least 34 children have already died of malnutrition in Gaza, the government media office reported on June 22. The true number could be higher, as limited access to Gaza has impeded aid agencies\u2019 efforts to fully assess the crisis there. More than 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition, the\u00a0UN\u2019s agency for Palestine refugees\u00a0(UNRWA) said earlier this month. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed\u00a037,658 Palestinians\u00a0and injured another\u00a086,237 people, according to Gaza health officials. Severe water shortages As Younis suffers in his mother\u2019s arms in Gaza\u2019s south, children in the north have been dealing with food shortages even longer. In the Jabalya refugee camp, they queue at a water truck, beads of sweat rolling down their faces, as they weave through the rubble-filled streets. Dozens of other Gazans crowd together to access water as aid workers nearby distribute thick, steaming red soup from large saucepans. It\u2019s rare access to food and clean water. Those in the north told CNN they have resorted lately to drinking polluted water, which does little to help dehydration and spreads infectious diseases. Israel insists there is \u201cno limit\u201d on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but its inspection regime on trucks, restrictions on land routes and increased bombardment means relief is barely trickling in.\u00a0Even when aid enters the besieged territory, the risk of hungry Palestinians scrambling over convoys hampers distribution efforts. UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u00a0recently\u00a0warned the\u00a0absence of police authorities in Gaza during the conflict had led to \u201ctotal lawlessness.\u201d Earlier this year, the UN\u00a0warned that\u00a0Israel is creating an \u201centirely man-made disaster\u201d in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has\u00a0\u00a0denied allegations\u00a0by the International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor that he has used \u201cstarvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\u201d \u201cThe only water we have is what we get as aid. People are suffering as a result, it is indescribable,\u201d said one civilian named Hassan Kalash.\u00a0\u201cWe are ill and don\u2019t have the strength to transport the water\u2026 The water pipe is broken. We do not have water infrastructure.\u201d Civilians there told CNN they have no access to running water, relying on scant aid entering the area. At least 67% of water and sanitation facilities in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or damaged in the eight months of bombardment,\u00a0UNRWA\u00a0said last week. All of five wastewater treatment plants in Gaza have shut down,\u00a0according to the UN Environment Programme. The UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has\u00a0accused Israeli authorities of obstructing humanitarian access to northern Gaza. In the first three weeks of\u00a0June,\u00a036 trucks carrying aid \u2014\u00a0 which were facilitated by Israel \u2014 were allowed to reach Gaza, while another 35 were either denied access,\u00a0impeded\u00a0or canceled due to logistical, operational or security reasons. The impact on the ground is visceral. In Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza, 5-year-old Razan wears a gold ring on her finger, which is covered in red sores. The Palestinian girl is sprawled on a trolley in the central Gaza facility, her grey eyes weary with exhaustion. \u201cShe changed after the war. She became weak,\u201d her aunt, Um Razan Mheitem, told CNN, adding that her niece had developed skin inflammation due to malnutrition. \u201cWe cannot find anything for her. Everything in the market is expensive, or not available.\u201d \u2018Waiting for them to die, one by one\u2019 Newborn babies and pregnant women are among the most at risk of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza, according to aid agencies and health workers. Undernourished mothers are more likely to give birth prematurely, with\u00a0newborns dying because they weigh too little. At the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, doctors were unable to keep baby Amal alive just four days after her birth. CNN filmed the moments before her death, showing Amal drawing heavy breaths in an incubator, after her mother, Samaher, gave birth two months prematurely. Her tiny pink toes are covered in plastic tubes. \u201cThese babies are dying. It is God\u2019s decision, but it is caused by people,\u201d her father, Ahmed Maqat, told CNN, after she died on Saturday. Samaher had endured months of her pregnancy without sleeping, eating or drinking, Maqat said. \u201cEveryone in these beds today is at risk of dying. We are waiting for them to die one by one,\u201d he added, his voice quivering with grief. \u201cWe have no life.\u201d Dr Ahmed Kahlot, head of the incubators department at Kamal Adwan, told CNN that Samaher\u2019s poor health meant her daughter was just \u201cwaiting for death.\u201d Many of those who do survive are too dehydrated and malnourished to breastfeed their children. But health workers told CNN there are few alternatives, with shortages of lactose free or soya milk for infants. Another Palestinian in Kamal Adwan Hospital told CNN that her son, who suffers from an inflamed esophagus, is unable to access soya milk, which he needs in his condition. \u201cHe hardly sits,\u201d she said of her 2-year-old child. \u201cHe cannot even crawl, cannot walk.\u201d Around 250 patients are receiving treatment for malnutrition at the hospital, and there are only two functioning stabilization centers for severely malnourished children in Gaza, OCHA reported\u00a0earlier this month, endangering almost 3,000 children, who were receiving treatment for acute malnutrition in the south prior to the military escalation in Rafah. Doctors say they are often unable to treat babies who show symptoms of malnutrition, including breathing problems, chest infections, and severe dehydration, amid dwindling medical supplies. Malnourished patients with chronic or infectious illnesses are less likely to recover,\u00a0a local pediatrician\u00a0told CNN, as the spread of\u00a0disease spikes\u00a0in displacement shelters. Authorities in Gaza have recorded more than 1.4 million cases of infectious diseases since October 7, according to the Ministry of Health there. As hunger worsens and parts of the enclave hurtle towards widespread famine, aid agencies have repeatedly called for the opening of land crossings into Gaza, which they say are the most effective way of getting relief into the strip. A US-built floating pier designed to bring in aid in by sea has been beset by problems \u2014\u00a0from unfavorable sea conditions to distribution issues once the aid ins transferred on land \u2014\u00a0failing to make a meaningful difference to the crisis. Back in Khan Younis, Ismail Madi told CNN last week how worried he was for his 4-year-old son, Ahmad, who was suffering jaundice from malnutrition. \u201cMy son will not be able to survive this,\u201d he said. \u201cI call on the American president Joe Biden\u2026 to intervene,\u201d added Madi, \u201cto save this child who has nothing at all to do with any political conflict.\u201d But just days later, the boy died. With other young children to provide for, Madi\u2019s life as a parent is full of stress. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to feed a family of 10 in these difficult times.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/israel-gaza-children-starvation-malnutrition-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_21_europe_italy-indian-farm-worker-death-intl-latam", "text": "The death of an Indian\u00a0migrant\u00a0worker in Italy, who was reportedly abandoned on a road after his arm was severed at work, has sparked outrage and prompted calls for a demonstration on Saturday in the town of Latina, in the country\u2019s central Lazio region. Satnam Singh,\u00a0a 31-year-old farm worker, was left on the street\u00a0Monday\u00a0after losing his right\u00a0arm while working at\u00a0a farm near Latina, which is southeast of Rome, CNN\u2019s affiliate SkyTG24 reported. His arm was reportedly severed by a plastic wrapping machine on the farm. Singh died days later and has come to symbolize the plight of vulnerable migrant workers in the country, with several trade unions and Latina\u2019s Indian community organizing demonstrations in the following days. Italian state broadcaster RAI said Singh was hooked by the plastic wrapping machine, towed by a tractor, which severed his right arm and crushed his lower limbs. Singh was then loaded into a van and abandoned near his home, while his severed arm was left in a vegetable collection box, RAI reported. He died\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0at\u00a0the San Camillo\u00a0hospital in Rome. An investigation into farm owner Antonello\u00a0Lovato \u2013 who allegedly left the injured Singh outside his home after the incident \u2013 has now been opened over potential charges of manslaughter and failure to assist a person in danger, Reuters reported, citing lead prosecutor Giuseppe De Falco. Singh did not have a regular contract or a residence permit, according to SkyTG24, and had been working at the same company for Italy for two years. CNN has reached out to De Falco and to Lovato\u2019s lawyers for comment, as well as to the Indian government. Lovato\u2019s father, Renzo Lovato told\u00a0RAI\u00a0that Singh had been warned \u201cnot to approach the vehicle\u201d and that \u201cthere is sadness because a man died at work and it should never happen. The\u00a0family\u2019s\u00a0lawyer, Valerio Righi, told Reuters that\u00a0Antonello Lovato \u201cspontaneously went to the judicial police an hour after the events, as any decent person would do,\u201d\u00a0adding that his client was waiting for the charges to be formalized to defend himself. Responding to allegations that Singh was abandoned without calls to an ambulance, Righi said, \u201cYou will see during the proceedings that maybe help was called sooner than people think.\u201d The farm worker\u2019s death has shocked the country. Italy Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed\u00a0her condolences and\u00a0strongly condemned Singh\u2019s death at\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0cabinet meeting. \u201cThese are inhumane acts that do not belong to the Italian people, and I hope that this barbarism will be harshly punished,\u201d she said in a statement. \u2018Unprecedented brutality\u2019 Trade unions met with the Italian\u00a0Labor Minister Marina Elvira Calderone and Agriculture\u00a0Minister Francesco Lollobrigida on Friday to discuss changes needed to prevent such events from happening again. What happened to Satnam Singh is \u201cmuch more than an injury: it is an inhuman act of barbarism in which those who abandoned him demonstrated that they had no regard for the value of human life,\u201d Calderone said Thursday in an interview with RAI, calling for exemplary punishments against exploitation at work. Several trade unions have organized a demonstration for Saturday in Latina and called for a two-hour strike to demand \u201cdignity and respect for the health and safety of workers\u201d and to urge political and social forces to combat worker exploitation and inhuman work conditions. Trade unions have also organized a fundraiser to raise funds for Singh\u2019s family, with some condemning Italy\u2019s gangmastering system, which involves the illegal recruitment and exploitation of agricultural workers. In a press release on Wednesday, trade union leader Maria Grazia Gabrielli called the incident one of \u201cunprecedented brutality\u201d. She said the incident was a result of \u201cthe irregularity in which we relegate thousands of\u00a0migrants who arrive in our country in search of hope.\u201d She said migrants found themselves as \u201cslaves of contemporary society, irregular, without a residence permit, and therefore more susceptible to blackmail by those who consider work only for profit, and rights - such as that of assistance - only as obstacles.\u201d Gabrielli added that exploitation in the fields often results in \u201cstarvation wages, unsafe and inhuman working rhythms and conditions, psychological and physical violence which unfortunately also lead to terrible events like the one in Latina.\u201d The Indian community of Latina will take to the streets on June 25\u00a0 to take part in a demonstration in memory of Singh, and will deliver an open letter to the prefect of Latina, Maurizio Falco calling for action and denunciation of the incident, according to RAI. According to a report from Italy\u2019s biggest labor union, CGIL, and labor union FLAI, in 2021 there were approximately 230,000 irregular workers employed in the primary sector, which largely includes non-resident foreigners employed in agriculture.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/europe/italy-indian-farm-worker-death-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-orthodox-military-high-court-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the government to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military, delivering a blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that has the potential to unravel his ruling coalition. The court also ordered the government to withdraw funding from any religious schools, or yeshivas, whose students do not comply with draft notices. \u201cThe government wanted to distinguish at the level of law enforcement between individuals based on their group affiliation,\u201d the court said in its ruling. \u201cIt was determined that by doing so, the government seriously harmed the rule of law and the principle according to which all individuals are equal before the law.\u201d Ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) Jews have, for all intents and purposes, been exempt from national mandatory military service since Israel\u2019s founding (Palestinian citizens of Israel are also exempt.) Ultra-Orthodox men spend much of their early lives out of the workforce, entirely devoted to religious study. They view yeshivas as fundamental to the preservation of Judaism, as important to Israel\u2019s defense as the military. Most Israelis believe ultra-Orthodox men should serve in the military, according to recent polls, but Haredi parties have been staunchly opposed to efforts to rescind the draft exemption. Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition relies on two Haredi parties \u2013 United Torah Judaism and Shas \u2013 to govern. He has for weeks been trying to advance legislation through Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, that would enshrine in law a draft exemption for Haredi men. The decision comes at a critical time for a country at war for nearly nine months, and a prime minister whose far-right government lost its veneer of wartime solidarity earlier this month when Benny Gantz, an opposition leader, left Netanyahu\u2019s war cabinet. And although Israel\u2019s military chiefs publicly decry manpower shortfalls, this ruling is unlikely to result in large numbers of ultra-Orthodox men joining ranks anytime soon. \u201cThe Supreme Court ruling puts an end to 76 years of unlawful inequality and discrimination,\u201d Eliad Shraga, chair of the Movement for Quality Government in Israel \u2013 the main petitioner in the case \u2013 said in a statement. \u201cWe will no longer agree to the absurd situation where there are those who give to the state, contribute and even risk their lives, and there are those who do nothing.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s party, Likud, said in a statement reacting to the ruling that that legislation remained \u201cthe real solution to the conscription problem,\u201d and \u201cnot a High Court ruling.\u201d Aryeh Deri, leader of the Shas party, decried the ruling. \u201cEven here, in the Jewish state, alongside our precious fighters who sacrifice their lives against the enemies, we will continue to guard those who learn the Torah, which preserves our special power and creates miracles in battle,\u201d he said, according to the Ynet news site. \u201cWhoever tried to disconnect the people of Israel from the Torah in the past failed miserably.\u201d Nonetheless, Moshe Roth, a member of Knesset from the United Torah Judaism party, on Tuesday downplayed the ruling. \u201cNothing is going to change practically,\u201d Roth told CNN. \u201cMany see this as kind of muscle flexing.\u201d Although the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is now legally obliged to draft Haredi men, military leaders say they are not prepared to do so en masse. Ultra-Orthodox men, who already serve in some small numbers in the military, have particular religious requirements, and so they usually serve in special units. \u201cAccording to the calculations of the army, there were 1,800 that were conscripted last year,\u201d Gilad Malach, director of the Ultra-Orthodox in Israel program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said after the ruling. \u201cThe army needs to do some change in order to conscript them. According to the army, next year the army can receive 4,800.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that the Supreme Court says that, immediately, there is one legislation connected to conscription of the ultra-Orthodox society, and it is the regular conscription law,\u201d Malach added. \u201cWe are in a very, very problematic political situation for the (governing) coalition \u2013 for the Haredim, and for Netanyahu.\u201d Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General Gil Limon instructed the government on Tuesday to immediately begin recruitment of an additional 3,000 ultra-Orthodox men, which the military has already said it could accommodate. He also that that \u201cin light of the current needs of the army and to promote equality in the burden,\u201d the military must \u201cdevelop and present a recruitment plan to increase this number.\u201d Tensions in Netanyahu\u2019s government Although the Supreme Court has now ruled that the IDF must draft Haredi men, ultra-Orthodox leaders will continue to push for legislation that gives them a legal exemption. \u201cWe are being practical when it comes to any these issues, and leaving the coalition doesn\u2019t change the fact,\u201d Roth said. The ruling is likely to increase tensions within Netanyahu\u2019s government, and between its political and military leaders. The war in Gaza has put significant strain on Israel\u2019s military, and given the issue of recruitment an urgency it lacked before Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack. The IDF has called up huge numbers of reservists, asking them to serve extended tours of service and removing legions of workers from Israel\u2019s economy. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has publicly criticized Netanyahu\u2019s attempt to exempt Haredi Jews. And IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has been vocal about the need to draft Haredi men. \u201cEvery such battalion that we establish, an ultra-Orthodox battalion, decreases the need for the deployment of many thousands of reservists thanks to the mandatory service people,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cWe want to expand the base as much as possible \u2013 of those who come to enlist, I tell you that there is an opportunity for change in the ultra-Orthodox community.\u201d This is not the first time the Supreme Court has struck down the Haredi exemption. In 1998, the court told the government that allowing Haredim to get out of conscription violated equal protection principles. In the decades since, successive governments and Knessets have tried to solve the issue, only to be told again and again by the court that their efforts were illegal. In a February poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute, 64% of Israeli respondents and 70% of Jewish Israeli respondents said that the Haredi exemption \u201cshould be changed.\u201d The pollsters spoke with Israeli adults \u2013 600 in Hebrew and 150 in Arabic.

{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-ultra-orthodox-draft-explainer-intl", "text": "The Israeli Supreme Court issued a ruling on Tuesday ordering the government to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military. Since Israel\u2019s founding, ultra-Orthodox Jews have been exempt from mandatory military service. The court also said that the government could no longer fund any religious schools (called \u201cyeshivas\u201d) whose students don\u2019t participate in the draft. Though both men and women are subject to Israel\u2019s mandatory conscription, the ruling only applies to ultra-Orthodox men. Who are the ultra-Orthodox? The ultra-Orthodox, known as \u201cHaredim,\u201d in Hebrew, practice a form of Judaism that is marked by stringent religious observance and strict lifestyles. They make up around 14% of Israel\u2019s 9.5 million citizens, and are the fastest-growing segment of the population. Because they are disproportionately young, they make up 24% of recruitment-age Israelis, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. Why don\u2019t they serve in the military? Some do, but far fewer than most Israeli Jews. The vast majority do not participate in the country\u2019s mandatory military service. For ultra-Orthodox men, studying Judaism\u2019s religious texts is central not only to their own lives but \u2013 they believe \u2013\u00a0the preservation of all of Judaism, and even the defense of Israel. Torah study begins in the teenage years and often continues into young adulthood. It is a full-time pursuit that precludes secular study, participating in the workforce (and therefore paying taxes) \u2013 or serving in the military, as most non-Orthodox Israeli Jews do. Technically, the military service exemption applied to young men who were actively studying at a yeshiva. In practice, anyone who tells a recruiter that he studies at yeshiva \u2013 anyone who presents themselves to be ultra-Orthodox \u2013\u202fcan get out of service. \u201cThe Jewish people survived persecutions, pogroms and wars only thanks to the preservation of their uniqueness \u2013 the Torah and the mitzvot,\u201d the head of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Shas party said on Tuesday, referring to the 613 commandments that rule orthodox Jewish life. \u201cThis is our secret weapon against all enemies, as promised by the Creator of the world. Even here, in the Jewish state, alongside our precious fighters who sacrifice their lives against the enemies, we will continue to guard those who learn the torah, which preserves our special power and creates miracles in battle.\u201d What did the Supreme Court say? In essence, the court said that the ultra-Orthodox could not be treated differently from other Israeli Jews. The law that mandates military service, it said, also applies to them. (Palestinian citizens of Israel remain exempt from service.) \u201cThere is no legal framework that makes it possible to distinguish between yeshiva students and those destined for military service,\u201d the court said in its ruling. The government \u201cseriously harmed the rule of law and the principle according to which all individuals are equal before the law.\u201d Why is it important now? The fight over whether the ultra-Orthodox should serve in the military is nothing new. Their exemption is as old as the state of Israel itself \u2013\u00a0in place from its founding in 1948. The Supreme Court ripped up that longstanding rule 50 years later, telling the government that allowing the ultra-Orthodox to get out of conscription violated equal protection principles. In the decades since, successive governments and Knessets (the Israeli parliament) have tried to solve the issue, only to be told repeatedly by the court that their efforts were illegal. The latest government attempt to paper over the problem, in place since 2018, expired at the end of March. It of course took on new significance on October 7, when Hamas and other militant groups crossed over from Gaza and killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, and took hundreds captive. The months since have put incredible strain on Israel\u2019s military, and particularly on the reservists who have been called up for extended tours of duty. Growing fears of a full-scale war with Lebanon only add to those worries. Ultra-Orthodox politicians argue that the fight over getting them to serve is being used a political bludgeon, and that the military has no manpower problem. The Israel Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) leaders disagree. \u201cWe want to move forward, not because it\u2019s nice, [but] first of all because it\u2019s necessary,\u201d IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said recently. \u201cEvery such battalion that we establish, an ultra-Orthodox battalion, decreases the need for the deployment of many thousands of reservists thanks to the mandatory service people.\u201d The ultra-Orthodox service exemption has also stoked resentment among Israelis who have spent months away from their families while serving in the military, and seen loved ones killed. It has further opened the religious-secular divide in Israel that has always been present, but has grown, especially as the ultra-Orthodox share of the population increases. What does it mean for the war? In the short term, probably very little. Because the ultra-Orthodox have such strict religious practices, they usually serve in special units. The IDF is working to expand those units, but it will take time. \u201cAccording to the calculations of the army, there were 1,800 that were conscripted last year,\u201d Gilad Malach, director of the Ultra-Orthodox in Israel program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said after Tuesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe army needs to do some change in order to conscript them. According to the army, next year the army can receive 4,800.\u201d Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General Gil Limon instructed the government on Tuesday to immediately begin recruitment of an additional 3,000 ultra-Orthodox men, which the military has already said it could accommodate. He also that that \u201cin light of the current needs of the army and to promote equality in the burden,\u201d the military must \u201cdevelop and present a recruitment plan to increase this number.\u201d Where it could have a bigger impact is if it causes Israel\u2019s governing coalition to fall apart, which is entirely possible. Why is this ruling bad news for Netanyahu? When Netanyahu formed his government coalition in late 2022, he included two ultra-Orthodox parties \u2013 Shas and United Torah Judaism \u2013 to form a thin majority. Because yeshiva study is so important to those parties, this ruling could have big ramifications. For the moment, they seem to be downplaying the decision, saying they have no plans to pull out of the coalition. Despite the court\u2019s ruling, the ultra-Orthodox parties are still trying to pass legislation in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, that would enshrine the draft exemption in law. Because the IDF doesn\u2019t have the capacity yet to draft the ultra-Orthodox into special units, it\u2019s unlikely that many will be drafted anytime soon. Once those draft orders start going out, the court\u2019s order for the government to stop funding yeshivas whose students refuse to serve could have a big impact \u2013\u00a0and affect whether the ultra-Orthodox party leaders still think there\u2019s benefit to being part of the government. What comes next? This story has been full of endless twists and turns. It will almost certainly not be the final word. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, along with his ultra-Orthodox allies, will continue to try to pass a law enshrining the draft exemption in law. But as the past decades have proven, there is little guarantee that they will be able to do that in a way that satisfies the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/israel-ultra-orthodox-draft-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

And in nearby Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people have been rescued in the past 24 hours from rising water due to heavy rainfall, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith. \u2022 Flood threat in fire zone: A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning and more rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods. \u2022 Search for \u201cmore loss of life\u201d in New Mexico fires: In New Mexico, authorities reported\u00a0that at least two people\u00a0died, 1,400 structures were destroyed and more than 8,000 residents were evacuated as a result of\u00a0wildfires. The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for \u201cmore loss of life.\u201d The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. Ruidoso residents will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and authorities ask that they bring at least a week\u2019s worth of food and drinking water, as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Meanwhile, FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires. Heat wave to intensify and expand this weekend More record daily high temperatures are possible through the weekend as heat expands into new areas and intensifies in others. The extreme heat and humidity will combine to push the heat index \u2013 or how hot it feels \u2013 to 100 to 105 degrees over a widespread area, with 110 degrees possible in the southern mid-Atlantic. Record overnight low temperatures will\u00a0increase health risks\u00a0by reducing the ability for people to cool down at night. The nation\u2019s capital could potentially hit 100 degrees for the first time in eight years. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said an extended\u00a0heat\u00a0emergency will remain activated throughout the weekend and into next week. The National Weather Service said widespread temperatures in the upper 90s and even triple digits will be possible in the city. The city officially recorded a temperature of 100 degrees Saturday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Thursday signed a state of preparedness declaration ahead of the potentially hazardous\u00a0heat\u00a0wave. An\u00a0excessive\u00a0heat\u00a0watch\u00a0has been issued for most of the region for Saturday, according to the National Weather Service, with dangerous\u00a0heat\u00a0possible and the\u00a0heat\u00a0expected to feel between 105 and 110 degrees. The heat wave\u2019s prolonged nature is a serious concern. New York City residents could experience 90-degree temperatures or higher this weekend into early next week. The stretch would be the longest ever in June in the city. For the first time this year, the National Weather Service has issued a\u00a0heat\u00a0advisory\u00a0for the city. Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday announced the opening of the state\u2019s emergency operations center, which she said will monitor conditions and share resources with emergency management personnel across the state\u2019s 62 counties. Earlier this week, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said cooling centers will be open across the city. Philadelphia has extended a heat\u00a0health emergency through midnight on Sunday, according to the state\u2019s Department of Public Health. Philadelphia has\u00a0heat\u00a0alerts in place through the weekend, with temperatures expected to feel close to 99 degrees. New Jersey\u2019s\u00a0heat\u00a0alerts are in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.\u00a0It will feel around 100 degrees across the state Saturday and Sunday. Heat is also returning in full force in the West following a brief break. Heat alerts are already in place for portions of California, Arizona and Utah. Temperatures are expected to jump back up to 10 to 15 degrees above normal for Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Bakersfield, California, through the weekend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/weather/heat-wave-new-york-washington-dc-weekend/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze broke out at around 10:31 a.m. local time at a facility operated by battery maker Aricell in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, about 50 kilometers southwest of Seoul. It was extinguished around 3:10 p.m, and firefighters were able to enter the factory, said Hwaseong Fire Department official Kim Jin-young in a briefing. Among the dead, two were\u00a0Koreans and 20 were foreigners, the majority of whom were Chinese nationals, Kim added in a later briefing. Rescue workers recovered a number of burned bodies, Kim said, and one person died due to cardiac arrest. At least two people were seriously injured with burns and five suffered minor injuries, Kim said. The factory\u2019s worker\u2019s directory was burned, making the victim identification process difficult, Kim added. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered the Interior and Safety Ministry and the head of the fire department to \u201cmake all-out efforts\u201d to rescue people by \u201cmobilizing all available personnel and equipment.\u201d Lithium-ion batteries are found in many popular consumer products, powering laptops, cameras, smartphones and electric vehicles.

{"id": "2024_06_21_uk_king-charles-ascot-horse-racing-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Arriving in a horse-drawn open carriage, King Charles III and Queen Camilla attended Royal Ascot in style this week. Dressed in their finest frocks and wearing hats of all different shades, onlookers at the opening day of the five-day racing festival in Berkshire, southeast England, on Tuesday applauded as the royals passed by. Camilla wore a bold cobalt-blue dress with a wide-brimmed matching hat, while Charles sported a formal gray suit and top hat. In this year\u2019s official program, the royal couple made a touching nod to the late Queen\u2019s passion for horses, while wishing this year\u2019s participants the best of luck in the upcoming races. \u201cIt gave us immense pleasure and joy to witness Desert Hero\u2019s victory in the King George V Stakes last year, particularly as he was bred by Her late Majesty,\u201d the couple wrote in the program. \u201cWe wish all the participants this week the very best of luck in seeking that unique thrill of a Royal Ascot winner.\u201d Last year\u2019s Royal Ascot saw an unlikely win for Charles, with his horse, Desert Hero, overcoming odds of 18 to 1 to land first place. Francis Brooke, Charles\u2019 representative at Ascot, said the win was the \u201chighlight of the week,\u201d with Hero winning in \u201cthrilling style.\u201d Brooke added that this year\u2019s event will have a race named after the King. \u201cWe are delighted to have renamed our premier five furlong sprint in honour of His Majesty The King,\u201d he said in a statement. Another of Charles\u2019 horses, also inherited from the late Queen, raced in the Betfred Oaks at Epsom Downs last month, finishing in 11th place out of 12, according to the Jockey Club. This love of horses has bound together multiple generations of the royal family, from the time of Queen Anne in the 18th century, when Royal Ascot was created, to the present day. Camilla even reportedly met Charles at a polo match in Windsor in 1970. A long royal pedigree Royal Ascot dates to 1711, when Queen Anne established the first iteration of the quintessentially British spectacle, according to the event\u2019s organizers. This first event, held on August 11 that year, consisted of three separate heats, each four miles long, which Anne said would allow the \u201chorses to gallop at full stretch.\u201d It was a test of extreme stamina, according to Royal Ascot, with each heat roughly the same length as the modern-day Grand National. Nearly 100 years later, in 1807, Royal Ascot\u2019s oldest surviving race, known as the Gold Cup, was added to the mix. It was during the 2013 Gold Cup that the late Queen\u2019s face famously lit up with sheer joy as she watched her horse, Estimate, cross the finishing line in first place. \u201cWe have all the trophies. I have actually managed to win the Gold Cup, which is unusual,\u201d said Elizabeth, then 87 years old. Her passion for racing flowered when she was a teenager. \u201cWhen she was young, she had ponies. At the age of, I think, of 16, her father took her to the racing stable for the first time,\u201d John Warren, the late Queen\u2019s bloodstock adviser, told CNN in 2014. \u201cThere was a tremendously good filly (young female horse) at that time, and she went into the stable and she went and patted this filly, and she tells the story that she didn\u2019t want to wash her hands for the rest of the day for the touching of the horse.\u201d Over the years, her keen interest in the sport resulted in an impressive 24 wins at Royal Ascot and a significant return in prize money from her more than 400 horse racing victories in total. And the late monarch wasn\u2019t alone in her passion. Princess Anne, her only daughter, has taken after her as a keen rider and was even part of the British equestrian team at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games. And given Charles\u2019 good fortune at last year\u2019s Royal Ascot, it seems Queen Elizabeth\u2019s lucky streak has passed down to her son. \u201cThe King and Queen have retained a healthy interest in the sport,\u201d a spokesperson for the Jockey Club told CNN Wednesday. \u201cBecoming joint patrons of The Jockey Club and their subsequent visits to both Epsom Downs and Royal Ascot demonstrates their ongoing commitment to the sport of horse racing.\u201d Aside from racing, horses still have a practical role to play for the royal family. Since the reign of Queen Victoria in the 19th century, a particular type of horse called a Windsor Grey \u2013 known for its stamina and steady temperament \u2013 has been the favorite provider of horsepower for the royal family\u2019s carriages. Named because they used to be kept at stables in Windsor, Windsor Greys have been used in public ceremonial events like royal weddings and coronations to transport members of the clan and their guests. Over the years, race horses, carriage horses and ponies alike have been ever-present in the lives of the royal family, and despite the change in monarch, their position seems assured for many more years to come.

{"id": "2024_06_24_middleeast_marjayoun-lebanon-israel-border-war-fears-intl-hnk", "text": "In the town of Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, around five miles north of the Israeli border, the main square seems almost abandoned. A few men play billiards in a storefront nestled in a building crowned with life-sized statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Charbel, a revered Lebanese saint. They don\u2019t want to talk about the wars and rumors of war that for decades have plagued this predominantly Christian town near the border. Journalists are a bother, one grumbles, and goes back to the game. On the other side of the square, a woman in her thirties comes out of a grocery store with a small bag. \u201cMarjayoun is very nice, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d the woman, Claude, tells me. \u201cBut the shelling scares us.\u201d That\u2019s all she wants to say. Throughout the day, occasional thuds of incoming and outgoing fire echo through the streets. Tensions between Israel and Lebanon have risen sharply since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing military campaign by Israel in Gaza. The Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has been firing missiles, mortars and drones into Israel, and Israel has returned that fire. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the mountainous border have fled as concerns intensify about the possible outbreak of another full-fledged war. On the Lebanese side, residents of Shia-majority towns like Kafr Kila, Adaisa, Aita\u00a0Al-Shaab and Aitaroun have almost all left. Frequent Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages have reduced many of these communities to rubble. Marjayoun, in comparison, has been mostly spared. The town was the headquarters of the Israeli-armed and funded South Lebanese Army (SLA), a Christian-led proxy militia, during Israel\u2019s decades-long occupation of southern Lebanon, which ended 24 years ago after a protracted guerilla war with Hezbollah. When Israel pulled out in 2000,\u00a0many of Marjayoun\u2019s inhabitants fled south across the border to Israel, fearful of being accused by fellow Lebanese citizens of being collaborators with Israel. Their departure, along with Lebanon\u2019s collapsed economy, fear of yet another prolonged conflict, the absence of a functioning state and emigration have sapped Marjayoun of people and prosperity. Yet, more than two decades later, some residents still cling to their ancient town and vow not to leave. \u201cI feel this area has a geographical curse. There has always been tension,\u201d Edouard Achy told me. \u201cThe threats are coming from both sides of the border. Tensions are increasing day by day. Everything points to something about to happen.\u201d Is he going to leave, I ask. He shrugs. \u201cAfter more than eight months of this situation, people just want calm and quiet,\u201d he says. His sister, Amal, and her family have come to church to say a special prayer to mark 40 days since her mother died. Dressed in black with a crucifix around her neck, she brought large loaves of bread and bags of buns to share with the congregation. Amal exudes a strong connection with her hometown, but wonders how much longer it will be safe as the clouds of war gather overhead. \u201cWe\u2019re staying put, and God willing, we\u2019ll continue to stay,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThe south is the Holy Land. The Messiah tread here two thousand years ago.\u201d She paused and sighed. \u201cBut if things escalate to war and it reaches here like it did before, with some shelling, of course, like others, we\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d she said. \u2018In war, everyone loses\u2019 Half an hour away, in the mostly Druze town of Hasbaya, 85-year-old Abu Nabil sweeps the street outside his shop. The Druze faith is an offshoot of Islam, with adherents found in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Jordan. A pious man with a gentle smile and a bushy white moustache, he looks on the bright side of life. \u201cThe Lord is merciful to us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can sleep in our homes. We eat. We drink. No one goes hungry.\u201d Since his birth, Abu Nabil saw Lebanon gain its independence from France in 1943, prosper during the 1960s, become engulfed by civil war, invaded and partially occupied by Israel for decades, and partially occupied by Syria, also for decades. He has seen the country emerge from civil war, embroiled in war again with Israel in 2006, wracked by a string of high-profile assassinations, convulsed by a short-lived revolution in 2019, followed by economic collapse, and now once again, on the brink of full-scale war with Israel. \u201cWar is ruinous,\u201d he says, grasping my hand. \u201cIn war, everyone loses, even the winner.\u201d Across the street, young men drink coffee from small paper cups while smoking cigarettes. They don\u2019t want trouble, they say, declining to be interviewed. The worry here, and in many parts of Lebanon, is that if you speak out against Hezbollah, there could be a price to pay. Some people do, some politicians do, but when Hezbollah lives nearby, it\u2019s best not to take the risk. \u201cGaza is not my war, and I don\u2019t want to pray in Jerusalem,\u201d one of the men insisted. Another said one of reasons not one Israeli missile, bomb or artillery round has landed in Hasbaya is because young men act as a sort of armed community watch, making sure no one, neither Hezbollah nor Hamas, fires anything at Israel. It\u2019s not their turf and they\u2019re not welcome here, they say. Down the hill, there\u2019s a traffic jam on the road leading out of Hasbaya west towards Marjayoun. Cars crawl at a snail\u2019s pace, drivers sticking their heads out to see what it\u2019s all about. A large group of men, women and children stand around a new white stone building, all dressed in their best. Parked in front is a shining white convertible, the bonnet covered with bouquets of flowers and a license plate reads, in English, \u201cNewly Married.\u201d A group of men arrives in traditional Druze clothing\u2014with small turbans, vests and low-crotched trousers\u2014carrying drums and horns. As people leave the building, musicians strike up a raucous tune with a heavy beat and high notes, while others twirl prayer beads over their heads. The bride, Fatin, in a long lacy dress, and the groom, Taymour, emerge into the sunlight, and everyone cheers. I decide not to interfere with annoying questions about Israel, Hezbollah, impending war, death, destruction and displacement. Everyone is happy, enjoying the bright June afternoon, the noise, the presence of friends and relatives. \u201cWhy spoil such a beautiful day?\u201d I think. Looking at the festivities, you\u2019d never guess that Israeli forces are only about five miles away and that, not far from here, deadly projectiles are being hurtled back and forth across the border. The irony, however, was not lost on one man, who leaned over with a chuckle, \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating here while war is around the corner.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/middleeast/marjayoun-lebanon-israel-border-war-fears-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
