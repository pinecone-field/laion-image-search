{"id": "2024_05_16_europe_robert-fico-shooting-analysis-violent-attacks-intl-cmd", "text": "The horrific scenes in Slovakia following the assassination attempt on Prime Minister Robert Fico are a stark and brutal reminder of the dangers facing those who seek public office. Fico, a pro-Russia left-wing populist, was recovering Thursday after being shot multiple times in the stomach. Government ministers closely aligned with the prime minister quickly called the shooting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d pointing the finger of blame for the toxic political atmosphere at the opposition and the media. But Fico himself has been guilty of using emotive language in the past. He claimed the country\u2019s outgoing progressive President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 was an \u201cAmerican agent\u201d and accused her \u2014 without any proof \u2014 of acting in the interests of the US financier George Soros, a frequent target for\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0theories. \u010caputov\u00e1\u2019s allies said the comments have led to death threats. The issue is obviously not isolated to Slovakia. Politics across Europe and elsewhere have become bitterly divided over the past decade, with far-right and radical left-wing populists increasing their influence both in domestic politics and at a European level. Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have added to these tensions, as citizens look to their leaders to take a stand on highly contentious issues. These tensions exist in the same space as a political system that obliges elected officials to meet and mix with the people who vote them into office. The shooting came at a time of extreme political divisions over Slovakia\u2019s position in the world and its future. Fico is, and has always been, a highly divisive politician. His supporters see him as a caring leader who has their interests at heart. His opponents say he is a corrupt populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks. Fico\u2019s comments prompted \u010caputov\u00e1 to take legal action against Fico, suing him for defamation. Despite being one of the most popular Slovakian politicians, \u010caputov\u00e1 announced last year that she would be stepping down and would not run again. She specifically cited verbal attacks against her and her family as being among the reasons why she felt she \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough strength\u201d to serve for another term. The assassination attempt against Fico came as his coalition government is trying to push through a number of divisive measures, sparking months of large-scale peaceful protests. Fico\u2019s attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system are particularly controversial. The government is seeking to reduce penalties for corruption and has abolished the special prosecutor\u2019s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that concerned people directly connected to Fico and his party, SMER. The government is also trying to shut down the public service broadcaster RTVS, planning to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. That plan has sparked large-scale protests in Slovakia. Slovakia is not unique in its political divisions and move towards populism. Only this week, the Netherlands came one step closer to having a coalition government with a far-right party at its helm. In 2022, Giorgia Meloni became Italy\u2019s prime minister after running on an anti-immigration, socially conservative ticket. While both these leaders are on the right and Fico is on the left, specific definitions between the left and right are becoming less helpful across Europe in the context of populism. The swing towards populism is expected to play out in the European Parliamentary elections next month. Current polls suggest there will be enough far-right Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) that they will be able to block legislation. Political division, emotive overseas conflicts, high levels of migration and struggling economies all add to a pressure cooker that makes it dangerous to be a politician these days. Politicians are especially vulnerable to violent attacks for a few reasons. They are people whose position gives them a public platform that isn\u2019t dissimilar to that of a minor celebrity. Unlike minor celebrities, they are human representations of policies that people have extremely strong feelings about. If a politician belongs to a party that won\u2019t call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, they support genocide in the eyes of some voters. If a politician supported Covid lockdowns, they stripped people of their liberties, in some people\u2019s thinking. If an elected representative wants to keep funding Ukraine rather than encourage talks with Russia, some will see them as a warmonger thwarting peace. Politicians are also obliged to mix with the general public. In Britain, two sitting parliamentarians were murdered while holding meetings with the people they represented. In 2016, Jo Cox, a left-wing MP who had spoken in support of Syrian refugees, was killed by a far-right white supremacist. David Amess, a Conservative MP, was killed while meeting constituents at a church hall by an ISIS sympathiser. The threat of violence can be felt by politicians far beyond\u2019s Europe\u2019s borders. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead in July 2022 as he gave a campaign speech. Last year, Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio \u2013 an anti-corruption campaigner and lawmaker \u2013 was shot dead during a campaign rally, 10 days before the first round of voting. As long as they have these obligations to meet and mix, there is no amount of security that would completely remove this risk for politicians. Besides, limiting access to politicians could make the disconnect between the public and their elected representatives even worse. Finally, if you are someone looking to make a political point through a public act of violence, then who better than the human representation of what you oppose? It may be horrible to admit that politically motivated violence against a politician is an effective way of gaining attention for your cause, but that is the calculation that those who carry out these attacks will make. Attacking a random member of the public will not attract the media attention that attacking a politician will. Targeting someone with a public profile who actually represents something means that you can claim to be a political martyr rather than a simple murderer. There are two obvious ways of reducing this risk: restricting access to politicians and obtaining better intelligence on potential attackers. The first, while probably more effective, runs the risk of further alienating the public from their leaders. The second is time-consuming, requires increased investment in intelligence and security operations and results are not guaranteed. The third, less obvious, way of improving the situation is to lower the temperature of political discourse. In the days following the attack on Fico\u2019s life, the public will likely hear politicians across Europe calling for civility in politics and condemning radicalism. Next month\u2019s European elections and the discourse in the run-up to them will show how serious they are about calming political tensions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/europe/robert-fico-shooting-analysis-violent-attacks-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

As of Monday afternoon, Abinader\u00a0had 57.46% of the votes counted. Votes have been counted in over 99% of the polling stations, according to real-time data from the electoral board, which has yet to declare a winner.

{"id": "2024_05_20_sport_pep-guardiola-future-man-city-premier-league-spt-intl", "text": "In the last 15 years, there has been no manager more influential than Pep Guardiola. First he moulded the great Barcelona team of the late noughties and early 2010s, a side spearheaded by Lionel Messi and which played the \u2018tiki-taka\u2019 style now familiar around the world. He had a similar effect at Bayern Munich, winning three titles in his three seasons with the German giant. Latterly, Guardiola has cast his spell over the English Premier League \u2013 an institution famed for its unpredictably. His Manchester City teams have dominated the league with six titles in seven seasons, claiming a fourth in a row on Sunday. City is the first team to win four consecutive Premier League titles and such a feat vaults this iteration into the pantheon of greatest soccer teams ever. However, Guardiola suggested after his team\u2019s title victory that it could be part of his closing act in Manchester. \u201cThe reality is I\u2019m closer to leaving than to staying,\u201d Guardiola told Sky Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s eight years, will be nine. Right now my feeling is I want to stay next season. In elite football management it\u2019s rare for a manager to stay in charge of a team for so long given the pressures of the job. \u201cWe talked with the club, we have time to talk next season because I have to see the players as well, if they follow me, they follow us. I want to stay next season,\u201d added Guardiola. \u2018Second to none\u2019 Historically these last 15 years have been extraordinary for Manchester City fans. Often associated with living in the shadow of its crosstown rival United, consistently challenging for league titles has been very much out of City\u2019s oeuvre. A financial injection from the club\u2019s new Abu Dhabi-based owners in 2008 transformed the club. It took a remarkable finish to the 2011-12 season for City to win its first Premier League title \u2013 Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s last-minute goal has gone down in history as one of the most dramatic endings to a season. But it was Guardiola\u2019s arrival in 2016 which truly transformed the club into serial winners. After conquering the domestic leagues, the final hurdle was continental glory and in 2023 City won a first European Cup final to become only the second English club to complete the \u2018Treble\u2019 as Champions League, FA Cup and Premier League winners. The Spaniard made winning a habit for City, and proceeded to erode the final few mental hoodoos around the club with his winning mentality. Sunday\u2019s title \u2013 which City won by finishing two points ahead of Guardiola\u2019s disciple, Mikel Arteta, and Arsenal \u2013 reiterated the team\u2019s dominance. Whether it be Erling Haaland\u2019s goalscoring prowess, Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol\u2019s reinvention from center-back to attacking left-back or Phil Foden\u2019s Player of the Season-winning campaign, Guardiola has once again proved why he\u2019s at the forefront of his profession. However, City\u2019s dominance comes against the backdrop of the Premier League accusing the club in February 2023 of breaching more than 100 financial rules, which includes failing to provide accurate financial information, failing to comply with UEFA\u2019s financial fair play (FFP) regulations, and failing to follow Premier League rules on profit and sustainability. The league referred City to an independent commission. The club has continuously denied any wrongdoing and a conclusion to their case reportedly remains some time away. \u2018I have a contract\u2019 Departing West Ham manager David Moyes, whose side was defeated by City on the final day of the season, said Guardiola is \u201csecond to none.\u201d \u201cThere used to be an argument that clubs couldn\u2019t win the title back-to-back,\u201d he told Sky Sports. \u201cHe has blown that sky-high. Four in a row is incredible. \u201cEveryone in football is in awe of his coaching but there is more to it than that. He is a really good man-manager and has the ability to control players. Either that or he has some hairdryer because he has got them on a string because they won\u2019t step out of place.\u201d City has the opportunity to cap off another memorable season with yet more silverware in the form of the FA Cup. Guardiola\u2019s team faces rival United in the final on Saturday. While Guardiola and winning have become synonymous, the 53-year-old admits it does come with its motivational setbacks. \u201cI had that feeling last season [after we won the treble],\u201d he said in his press conference following Sunday\u2019s title victory. \u201cWe were in Istanbul and I said: \u2018It\u2019s over. What am I doing here? There is nothing left.\u2019 But I have a contract. I am here and I am still enjoying some of the moments, sometimes tired but some of them I love. \u201cAnd after a few days, we start playing good, winning games, different players, and we start to think about how no one has done four in a row. Why not try it? Now, I am feeling it is done. What next? I don\u2019t know, right now. Well, I know it is FA Cup.\u201d So what\u2019s next for City and Guardiola? \u201cBut, next season, right now, I am not able to know what will be the motivation to do it. It is difficult sometimes to find it when everything is done. \u201cBut I know that the players and myself will be there and think, why shouldn\u2019t we win today? Why not? Why should we not work as much as possible to do what we have to do?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/sport/pep-guardiola-future-man-city-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Kate Upton, Chrissy Teigen, plus-size model Hunter McGrady, and CBS News host Gayle King all posed for their own solo covers. (This marks the fourth time Upton has appeared on the magazine\u2019s cover, and the second time for Teigen.) The remaining three \u201cLegends\u201d covers feature alumni including Chanel Iman, Maye Musk, Megan Rapinoe and Winnie Harlow, among others, as well as snowboarder (and gold medal-winning Paralympian) Brenna Huckaby, the first amputee model to appear in the \u201cSwimsuit Edition\u201d and Halima Aden, the first hijabi model.

The magazine has also expanded its portfolio of cover stars to feature musicians, athletes and celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9, Kim Kardashian, Naomi Osaka and Megan Thee Stallion. \u201cWith each passing year, we have challenged ourselves to push boundaries and redefine what it means to be Sports Illustrated Swimsuit,\u201d said Day in the news release. \u201cWhile this year\u2019s issue is a tribute to the recent past, it\u2019s also a reminder of the work we must continue to do.

{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_amal-clooney-icc-arrest-warrant-israel-hamas-gaza-intl-latam", "text": "Human rights attorney Amal Clooney is among a group of legal experts who advised the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor to seek arrest warrants against the top leaders of Israel and Hamas. The panel was convened by the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan and tasked to review the evidence and legal analysis underpinning his application for warrants against three Hamas leaders and two Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It issued a detailed legal report on Monday, which said the panel found \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the individuals named in the arrest warrants have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. Clooney, who has represented victims of mass atrocities, faced online criticism prior to her announcement for not speaking about Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza. In a statement shared on her Clooney Foundation for Justice website on Monday, she explained how she had found herself advising Khan. \u201cMore than four months ago, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court asked me to assist him with evaluating evidence of suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel and Gaza,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI agreed and joined a panel of international legal experts to undertake this task.\u201d She said the panel\u2019s findings were \u201cunanimous\u201d despite their diverse backgrounds. \u201cI served on this panel because I believe in the rule of law and the need to protect civilian lives. The law that protects civilians in war was developed more than 100 years ago and it applies in every country in the world regardless of the reasons for a conflict,\u201d Clooney said in the statement. The eight-person legal panel consisted of renowned legal experts, including Theodor Meron, former President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and Lord Justice Fulford, a former ICC judge. They \u201cunanimously determined\u201d that the court had jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories and by Palestinian nationals, Clooney\u2019s statement wrote. The panel also was unanimous in concluding that \u201cHamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, including hostage-taking, murder and crimes of sexual violence.\u201d Clooney\u2019s statement added there was also \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d Netanyahu and \u201cIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity including starvation as a method of warfare, murder, persecution and extermination.\u201d A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. Both Hamas and Israeli politicians condemned the arrest warrants, with Netanyahu calling it a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d and an \u201coutrageous decision\u201d that \u201ccreates a twisted and false moral equivalence between the leaders of Israel and the henchmen of Hamas.\u201d The application for warrants marks the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. The Biden administration on Monday forcefully denounced the ICC\u2019s move, with President Joe Biden saying in a statement: \u201cWhatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2013 none \u2013 between Israel and Hamas.\u201d Clooney, who is a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London and an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School, is married to the actor George Clooney. Alongside her husband, she co-founded the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which gives free legal support to victims of abuses of power, according to its website. She has represented Yazidi victims of genocide \u201cin the only three genocide cases against ISIS members in the world,\u201d according to the website.

The couple has set up a flourishing business buying properties, restyling and reselling them, ready-to-occupy, helping foreign buyers every step of the way. Mongiardo, a 56-year-old architect, and dell\u2019Orso, a 51-year-old interior designer and real estate broker, have been doing this since 2015 from their office-home in the characterful town of Isca sullo Ionio, on the Ionian coast of southern Italy\u2019s Calabria region. They hunt for old houses in historical villages in need of a makeover, which once renovated make the perfect summer getaway. Their business, Calabria Sea Side, offers tailored services, including customized renovations and guided tours of the region that forms the toe of Italy\u2019s boot, showcasing its unspoiled nature and beauty . The couple knows the area well. Mongiardo is a Isca sullo Ionio native and escaped back home after 25 years working in Venice, which he says was \u201ctoo tight for him.\u201d Dell\u2019Orso, originally from Milan, used to vacation in Calabria as a child and 15 years ago bought a home in the charming medieval village of Badolato, which is also among the places in their real estate portfolio. \u201cIn those years depopulation in the villages halfway up the mountains was very strong, and houses came cheap. I was captivated by the idea of owning a piece of history, facing the sea while surrounded by mountains rich in nature and still untouched by mass tourism,\u201d Dell\u2019Orso tells CNN. \u2018Ideal place to live\u2019 The couple promotes properties scattered across the Ionian coast, which they believe is the most authentic and pristine corner of Calabria, as opposed to the more crowded and popular Tyrrhenian coast. \u201cHere the nature is very intense, the villages are charming, and the seawater is crystal clear. It\u2019s the ideal place to live and raise your children,\u201d Dell\u2019Orso says. The idea of launching a buy-and-restyle homes agency first came up as a joke, they say. It all started with them buying a small house, renovating it and then renting it out for the summer. They were surprised when many of the foreigners staying at their place asked them about similar vacation homes to buy. \u201cSo it came naturally to us to turn to foreigners \u2013 both Europeans and Americans \u2013 who seem to appreciate this environment much more than Italians, who take it for granted,\u201d says Mongiardo. \u201cWe then decided to purchase a few properties that needed full renovation and went on to resell them. Today though, most of the properties we sell are not our own but belong to our local clients. We act as intermediaries.\u201d Buying a house is never easy in a foreign land. Buyers have a lot of hesitation because they\u2019re not familiar with the laws, notary procedures and other aspects of the Italian real estate market, says Dell\u2019Orso, But the real challenge is how and in what time frame customers can adapt to and feel at home in a culture that is very different from their own. Pizzas and paperwork \u201cWhen we sell a house, we are actually selling a real-life project, which may begin as a [vacation home], but can turn into a radical change,\u201d she says. In fact, quite a few of their American and European clients decided to permanently move to Calabria after buying a home in the area. The pair helps clients discover and blend in with their new surroundings. They get together for a pizza and sunset aperitif and show them where the stores, supermarkets, restaurants, and tourist sites are, as well as solving technical aspects of daily life, like finding a plumber or buying plants for the terrace. Their services range from legal assistance and renovation works to property management and property insurance. They can also help rent out the property when the buyer is overseas. \u201cThe properties we put on sale are chosen carefully and we know personally each of the owners, who are proud of their homes and want to sell them to people who will appreciate their neighbors and take good care of their house,\u201d says Mongiardo. By selling these homes, their goal is also to promote the beauties of the Calabrian Ionian Coast, with wonderful seaside landscapes juxtaposed with views of the rising mountains dotted with ancient Greek ruins. In the past the area was part of Greece\u2019s overseas kingdom dubbed \u201cMagna Graecia.\u201d The duo wants to help depopulated towns regain their lost grandeur and restore them into thriving communities. Southern hospitality Locals here have retained the warmth and charming hospitality for which they\u2019re traditionally known, says Mongiardo. They accept a changing world but don\u2019t want to give up the old ways that have provided them with security and stability throughout their life. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a slightly ancient world, but still rich in values and humanity\u201d, he says. Since homes are located in small villages where life is slower-paced and everyone knows each other, Mongiardo says that newcomers find the ancient vibe very fascinating and are always pleasantly impressed. \u201cOver here it is a bit like stepping back into the past. Foreigners show more passion because they don\u2019t take for granted certain ways of doing things, like celebrating religious events, that Italians, especially those in the south, experience in their daily lives.\u201d Mongiardo says there is a growing number of Americans who have begun to buy vacation homes in these under-the-radar spots, many even living here year-round. The old properties the pair handles are located in small towns where centuries-old traditions survive. These are little-known, secret gems such as Isca sullo Ionio, Sant\u2019Andrea Apostolo dello Iono, Badolato, Davoli, San Sostene, Santa Caterina dello Ionio, Montepaone and Soverato. The houses they re-sell - all ready to occupy and equipped with modern comforts - are mostly stand-alone properties with several floors, usually in the local medieval \u201ctower house\u201d style. However, even though re-modeled, the couple says they guarantee that the buildings retain their \u201coriginal soul\u201d and have a unique architecture - none are identical. Second chances and new challenges Most houses on their books are located halfway between the sea and the mountains, with the beaches just a few minutes away by car. \u201cThere are also people who prefer to stay up on the mountains, even at higher altitudes you can enjoy a wonderful sea view,\u201d says Dell\u2019Orso. They deal in houses starting from 300 square feet up to larger properties of 3,000 square feet, some with gardens. \u201cObviously prices change quite a bit, but this gives us the opportunity to offer different solutions, depending on one\u2019s needs or tastes\u201d, says Mongiardo. The typical seaside house for two to four people with an average 700 square footage costs around $35,000 and requires roughly $55,000 to renovate. For a total cost of $90,000, it\u2019s possible to have a beach house in a historic hamlet, with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and an open-plan kitchen and living room. For Dell\u2019Orso every \u201chome project\u201d is a new world to explore. The part she loves most about her job is meeting new people and fascinating them by spinning tales of the region. Mongiardo deals more with the technical side of real estate \u2013 construction sites, workers and permit requests. \u201cMy wife and I are a team, so we spend most of our working time together. I really like old houses and the idea of giving them a second chance: especially when they are abandoned buildings rich with history. Every project becomes a new challenge, which eventually pays off with great satisfaction,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/buying-cheap-house-italy-calabria-couple/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Zourabichvili had previously\u00a0vowed to torpedo the bill, but her veto could still be overruled by a simple majority in parliament, which approved the bill on Tuesday with 84 lawmakers voting in favor and 30 against. The divisive legislation would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face a fine. Opponents say the bill was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to snuff out opposition and civil society. \u201cThis law, in its essence and spirit, is fundamentally Russian, contradicting our constitution and all European standards,\u201d President Zourabichvili said after vetoing the bill on Saturday. She said the bill must be repealed, suggesting it could prevent the country from joining the European Union. The EU had given similar warnings. Georgia applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, a move seen as an effort to reverse the former Soviet republic\u2019s drift toward Russia. Georgia has long been caught between\u00a0Russia and the West. Despite gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and polls showing that an estimated 80% of Georgians want to join the EU, its history with Moscow is hobbling its relationship with Europe. Georgia\u2019s stance towards Russia is decidedly mixed. The two countries have had no formal diplomatic relations since Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 \u2013 but Russians living and working there enjoy lax visa requirements, making it an easy choice for those who fled from Russia\u2019s conscription into the war in Ukraine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/europe/georgia-president-veto-foreign-agents-bill-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_europe_life-goes-on-in-kharkiv-cmd-intl", "text": "CNN visited Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, on May 10-11, 2024, to speak to people about the war. The visit coincided with a major Russian push across the border. Thirty miles to the north, Russian forces are invading again. But in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, life cracks on. Upstairs at the Che champagne bar on Sumska Street, girlfriends arrive in twos and threes, dressed to impress. They take photos of each other, backlit in pink and gold, and framed by floor-to-ceiling shelves of Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. \u201cWe are all 1654,\u201d it says on the wall and on the sugar sachets,\u00a0a reference to the year the city was founded. The last two\u00a0years\u00a0have been among the toughest. Just across the street from Che is the regional government headquarters. On March 1, 2022 - the sixth day of Russia\u2019s war \u2013 CCTV caught the moment it was struck by two missiles. Today, the windows are boarded up, but the exterior is in surprisingly good order. A huge poster hangs over the front bearing words all Ukrainians know. Keep fighting \u2014 you are sure to win! God helps you in your fight! For fame and freedom march with you, And right is on your side! When we meet\u00a0businessman\u00a0and philanthropist,\u00a0Yuriy\u00a0Sapronov, outside a caf\u00e9 after lunch, he has just been updated about\u00a0the battlefield situation by\u00a0soldiers along the border. The news is not good. Russians have pushed through in two areas in a four-battalion effort.\u00a0Sapronov\u00a0reckons the aim is to draw Ukrainian forces away from positions defending Chasiv Yar in the Donbas region to the southeast. He draws a map on the paper place-setting in front of him explaining how far Russia needs to advance to get its artillery in range to hit the city. He\u2019s confident they won\u2019t succeed because Ukraine has moved combat-hardened brigades to defend\u00a0those\u00a0positions. Not that it will stop Russia sending S-300 missiles and guided aerial bombs towards Kharkiv. The fastest of them will make impact within a minute of being launched, so close is the city to Russia. \u201cEveryday genocide,\u201d\u00a0says\u00a0Sapronov. The businessman\u00a0was born in Kaliningrad, now a part of Russia, then a part of the Soviet Union, more than 60 years ago.\u00a0His father was in the Soviet air force and when the time came for him to step into the reserves, he was told he could move his family to almost any location he wanted. He chose Kharkiv\u00a0for its universities,\u00a0to give Yuriy and his sister a good place to study. Sapronov\u00a0himself became a businessman after abandoning his job as a chemistry teacher in the chaos of the Soviet Union\u2019s demise. He traded in metals, oil and computers, before later moving into construction. \u201cMoney was just lying at my feet back then,\u201d he says. It is\u00a0very\u00a0different now. His businesses have ceased. Instead, he raises money for the army, and chips in himself. Anything from drones to generators, from motor vehicles to power banks. Local brigades tell him what they need; he pays for some of it and secures financing for the rest. We ask\u00a0Sapronov\u00a0why he is still here. As a man\u00a0older than\u00a0fighting age, he could leave the country, or at least move to a quieter part of Ukraine. But his mind was clear from the very beginning, he says. His wife asked him the day after the war began what they were going to do. He told her they were staying\u00a0put. \u201cIn my passport it is written that I am Russian by nationality. But I am not Russian, I am Ukrainian,\u201d\u00a0Sapronov says. Hotel manager Olha Sokolenko Olha Sokolenko is not a Kharkiv native either. The hotel manager\u00a0came\u00a0to the city\u00a0from Kyiv 15 years ago. On December 30 last year, she was leading her team at the Kharkiv Palace Hotel, getting ready for a New Year\u2019s Eve party the next day. At 7 p.m., a Russian missile crashed into the building\u2019s fitness center on the 11th floor, exploding three floors down. She shows us a massive hole left by the missile as it passed through a bedroom floor. Fifteen rooms were occupied at the time of the attack, all on lower floors for safety. About 20 staff were on duty. Remarkably, no one was killed and only one person was injured and needed treatment. Olha herself was among the most fortunate. She was right there on the 11th floor when the missile struck, but on the other side of the building. \u201cIt seems my work on this earth isn\u2019t done,\u201d she says wryly, when we suggest she must feel very lucky. The memory will never leave her, though, especially\u00a0the sound of the missile strike.\u00a0\u201cTerrible, like a very strong lightning strike,\u201d\u00a0she recalls. It was only a few hours afterwards that rescuers recovered her phone, covered in dust but still working. There was a load of missed calls, not just from friends and family, but from people all over the world \u2013 one-time guests at the hotel, checking she was OK. Russians hit the building, she says, because they claimed there were important decisions being taken by people inside. In fact, Olha says, there were only civilians in the building \u2013 mostly journalists and people preparing to celebrate New Year with their families. \u201cThis hotel has been my life\u2019s work,\u201d she says. \u201cPeace will come, and guests will return to Kharkiv.\u201d FC Metalist Kharkiv Matviy\u00a0Kolotay\u00a0is 15 years old and his favorite player is Cristiano Ronaldo. It is an opinion widely held among the boys of the academy of FC Metalist Kharkiv, who have piled into a small room after Saturday training to watch the first team in action against Hirnyk Sport. Matviy has been with the club since 2021 but he amazes us when he explains that while he lives in Kharkiv, his family lives in Kremenchuk, about\u00a0140 miles (225 kilometers)\u00a0away in the safer center of the country. \u201cMy parents are worried for me, but the main thing is that I am playing football,\u201d he says. The war is not something he likes to talk about. \u201cMe-ta-list! Me-ta-list!\u201d the boys roar. They are led by Mikhaylo Galushko, one of the coaches. Every club needs a man like him. Someone to get the chant going, a man who claps his hands together with such force you can feel the audio peaking inside your head. FC Metalist play their games in Uzhhorod, the farthest point you can get from Kharkiv without leaving Ukraine. It takes more than a day to get there on the train. The boys shout at the screen like football supporters everywhere, appealing every dodgy decision by the referee. \u201cEven in this difficult time, the children come here, and we give them the attention they deserve. Thanks to sport, thanks to our attention, they are distracted [from the war] and forget about everything that is going on,\u201d\u00a0Galushko\u00a0says. It is no easy task. An air raid siren the day before had lasted the entire day and all training was canceled. If the alarms go off halfway through a session, the boys are taken to the bomb shelter. The banter resumes the moment they are inside. \u201cAll conversations are turned into jokes, so the boys are not afraid.\u201d We tell Galushko that one of the CNN team supports English football club Everton. \u201cAh, you remember, the match?\u201d he says, referring to a UEFA Cup tie between the teams in 2007. \u201cWe let you win!\u201d Had he at any point thought of leaving Ukraine in the last two years? \u201cWe never went anywhere. When the war started, my younger son was at a tournament in Poltava. While everyone was leaving Kharkiv, he was coming back to Kharkiv on an empty train,\u201d\u00a0Galushko\u00a0says. \u201cMy family is all in Kharkiv. Two children, both play football. I do not want to go anywhere. This is my homeland.\u201d Kharkiv\u2019s mayor The city\u2019s mayor\u00a0Ihor Terekhov speaks slowly and quietly, pausing to allow his translator to render\u00a0carefully\u00a0his Ukrainian into English, sentence by sentence. The war started just a few months after he was elected mayor at the end of 2021. We are talking just a few hours after Russia began its latest\u00a0offensive, immediately to the north. What President\u00a0Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky would later that day call a new wave of counteroffensive actions comes after months of increased Russian air strikes on the city. By the end of March, they had knocked out the entire region\u2019s power generating capacity, as well as all its electricity substations. Street lights are now completely switched off and there are rolling blackouts from\u00a0one\u00a0neighborhood to\u00a0another. The underground rail network is still running, one train every 20 minutes. Pre-war, they ran every two to three minutes. Still, it works. For the mayor of Kharkiv, one message matters more than any other: the people of his city are staying put. Russia will not drive them out. \u201cAs we can see [today], the Russian aggressors have intensified their actions on the border in several directions [..] But, despite everything, you can see the city is alive, that no one is running away,\u201d\u00a0Terekhov\u00a0says, through his translator. \u201cThis is the main thing. There is no panic.\u201d Most people though will tell you the city has lost people in recent months. Not like the first few months of the war, when the population shrunk from about 1.5 million to 300,000, before many returned as Ukraine\u2019s fortunes improved later in the year. But some families are\u00a0now\u00a0choosing to move to safety\u00a0again\u00a0as the Russian threat re-emerges. Even so, the mayor shakes his head when we ask him if numbers have declined since the start of the year. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, before\u00a0correcting himself. \u201cThere was a slight decrease. A few people have left. A few others have returned.\u201d Caf\u00e9 Snidanishna A large Hyundai generator sits just inside the door of Caf\u00e9 Snidanishna, which lies about a mile north from the city center. It is off when we arrive because the power in the city is switched on. Co-owner Borys Lomako explains they only really need it to keep the lights and the coffee machine working. The oven is wood fired. It is a gem of a place. We order chicken liver pate, served with red berries, and freshly made bread, toasted. Along with two friends,\u00a0both\u00a0fellow entrepreneurs, he opened the caf\u00e9 three months ago.\u00a0Revenues from some of their other interests, predominantly a confectionery business, help to support it. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a business model, it\u2019s primarily about keeping my life in Kharkiv. To send signals both to Kharkiv residents who stay here that life goes on, and signals to those outside of Kharkiv that Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city and people live here.\u201d Lomako\u00a0explains that he and his partners traveled across the country to collect local recipes and techniques. There is gombovtsi on the menu \u2013 a sweet dough from the\u00a0Carpathian Mountains\u00a0in Ukraine\u2019s far southwest. And kachina kasha - porridge made from rolled millets dipped in egg and flour, from the Naddniprianshchyna region, along the Dnipro River. Preparing the dish is time-consuming,\u00a0Lomako\u00a0says, and that is the point. It takes time. It is hard work. \u201cEven just choosing to eat Ukrainian food means that we are choosing Ukraine,\u201d he says. He articulates the existential threat most Ukrainians feel about Russia\u2019s invasion, the certainty that Russians want to wipe out their history and their culture. When we are talking, a little after\u00a09 a.m., Kharkiv is already on its third air raid siren of the day, and the cross-border offensive is into its second day and making progress. \u201cAs I see it, this is a choice of life. Every day we can choose death or life. And choosing to eat, choosing to go to restaurants, choosing to cook for people is a choice to live, not to die. Yes, this is resistance for me, it is creative resistance.\u201d Dmytro Gurov\u2019s destroyed printing house Walking through the burned-out wreckage of Dmytro Gurov\u2019s 5,000-square-meter printing business is an almost overwhelming experience. Twisted metal girders and air vents, plaster and ceiling tiles gone, all windows blown out. Everywhere, remnants of the puzzles, children\u2019s card games, books and magazines that once rolled out of machines here. Cutting machines, printing machines, laminating machines. A million bits of torn paper. All covered in dust. And the taste of the blast and the fire that followed\u00a0are\u00a0still clear on the tongue, almost two months on. The weapon that did all this was originally designed to sink ships. It flew low around the city, evading air defenders, before ending its flight right here, killing five and wounding 20. We ask\u00a0Gurov\u00a0if\u00a0he is angry over\u00a0what has become of the business he started back in 2007. It would feel like a reasonable response. \u201cIt is not going to help. There is no time to sit around crying and blaming someone for something. The question here is: what do we do next? If we are going to recover, then how?\u201d Government assistance should bring in about\u00a0$200,000, but the cost of the strike runs into millions, he says. In fact, rebuilding began immediately. Employees came in the next day offering to work for nothing. Some machines could be salvaged and the first of those cleaned up and moved to another workspace were working again within a month. \u201cLike a phoenix,\u201d\u00a0Gurov\u00a0says. Kharkiv theater goes underground A small theatre audience watches as the female character on the roof says she is ready to jump. But the man, a stranger, isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cJust look down there, it\u2019s a right mess, there is rubbish everywhere,\u201d he says ironically. The Kharkiv State Theater should be playing in front of 900 people. Now the actors perform in a basement club with just enough space for six rows of audience. Since the start of the year, it has become one of several city institutions forced underground by the war. Schools, too, are slowly going subterranean. Big productions with large casts are\u00a0impossible in such a small space, director Oksana Stetsenko says. But at least they no longer need to pause the play and exit the playhouse whenever the sirens go off. \u201cWe have to adjust, adapt, but still do our job. We must do our job,\u201dStetsenko\u00a0says. She chose the play,\u00a0\u201cSuicide of Loneliness,\u201d\u00a0by Ukrainian playwright Neda Nezhdana, because it is about people making choices. \u201cWe are all individuals.\u201d She is thinking of the soldiers, too. \u201cThere are individuals at the front. They are not a biomass. An individual makes his or her own choice, thinks, draws conclusions, and says to himself or herself: I want beautiful things, I want eternal things, I want peace, I want well-being for my family, for my children.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/europe/life-goes-on-in-kharkiv-cmd-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_16_style_copenhagen-old-stock-exchange-fire-intl", "text": "A huge fire has engulfed Copenhagen\u2019s old stock exchange, one of the Danish capital\u2019s most famous landmarks, causing its spire to collapse as staff and citizens scrambled to rescue paintings and historic artefacts from the blaze. \u201cI cannot describe how upset I and my colleagues are,\u201d said a visibly moved Brian Mikkelsen, CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, which owns and has offices in the 17th century building. \u201cIt is a huge disaster, because it is 400 years of cultural history that is in flames.\u201d Stunned commuters and onlookers watched as the raging fire could be seen swirling around the building\u2019s distinctive 56-meter spire - shaped as the tail of four entwined dragons - moments before it collapsed and fell into the street below. Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported.

{"id": "2024_05_17_americas_gary-allen-srery-alberta-canada-deaths", "text": "After 48 years of investigation, Alberta Royal Canadian Mounted Police linked the deaths of four young women killed in the Calgary area in the 1970s to one man \u2013 a serial sexual offender who they believe may have committed more violent crimes until his death. Police say Gary Allen Srery killed\u00a0junior high school friends Eva Dvorak and Patricia McQueen, both 14 years old, in 1976, before killing Melissa Rehorek, 20, and Barbara MacLean, 19, in the span of a year. \u201cSrery\u2019s criminality spanned decades, over multiple jurisdictions, under numerous aliases, and the Alberta RCMP believe there may be more victims,\u201d Alberta RCMP said in a news release Friday. Crime scene DNA was seized during the initial homicide investigations, but due to a lack of DNA technology at the time, police failed to link a suspect to the killings. About 30 years later, in 2003, police were able to confirm the same suspect was linked to Rehorek and MacLean\u2019s deaths through DNA evidence. And in 2021, resubmitted crime scene evidence from the Dvorak and McQueen investigations unearthed a link with those of Rehorek and MacLean, according to RCMP. \u201cThe same unknown male DNA profile was identified on both victims that matched the unknown male DNA profile from the Rehorek and MacLean murders,\u201d police said in a news release. \u201cIn light of this new information, the RCMP believed that the same male offender was responsible for the deaths of all four victims.\u201d Advancements in forensic science technology and the use of forensic investigative genetic genealogy, which combines DNA analysis with traditional genealogy research, have allowed more breakthroughs with DNA evidence collection. Police used genetic genealogy to identify, Srery, an American who died of natural causes in an Idaho state prison in 2011 while serving a sentence for rape. \u201cWith assistance from Interpol and Idaho State Police Forensic Services, Srery\u2019s DNA was confirmed as a match to the unknown male DNA profile present on all four Calgary victims,\u201d police said. At the time of the killings, Srery was living illegally in Canada, having fled the US in 1974 after posting bail for a rape charge in California, according to RCMP. Before coming to Calgary, Srery had an extensive criminal record in the US for sexual offenses, including forcible rape, kidnapping, burglary and sexual perversion. Srery lived in Alberta and British Columbia from the mid 1970s until he was deported in 2003, police say. He used several aliases, including Willy Blackman and Rex Long. \u201cFor over forty years, investigators did not give up in their pursuit to identify those responsible for these murders,\u201d said David Hall of the Alberta RCMP. \u201cIdentifying the perpetrator does not bring Eva, Patsy, Melissa or Barbara back. It is our hope however, that the families are finally able to have some answers as to what happened to their loved ones all of those years ago,\u201d he said.

{"id": "style_brutalist-plant-photos-c2e-spc", "text": "Austere. Stark. Cold. The common opinions about Brutalist architecture are a far cry from the way we often describe the natural world: lush, colorful, verdant. But a new photobook is exploring nature\u2019s relationship with Brutalist architecture \u2014 from a theater in Japan to a library in Canada \u2014 and finding beauty in the contrast. Called \u201cBrutalist Plants,\u201d the book is a \u201cmix of looking into the future but also looking back,\u201d said Olivia Broome, curator of the book and creator of the @brutalistplants Instagram community of more than 30,000 followers. Broome hopes the images will inspire people to look at the built environment differently \u2014 and see it as a place that can complement nature. \u201cEither we all exist in harmony with nature and concrete, or we all mess it up so badly that nature is going to overtake everything that we build,\u201d she said. Dystopia or utopia? Brutalism, sometimes referred to as \u201cNew Brutalism,\u201d is an architectural style typified by its imposing form, use of geometric shapes and clean lines, exposed concrete, and monochromatic color schemes. Its popularity peaked between the 1950s and \u201870s and it\u2019s commonly associated with the UK and Eastern Europe, but this international style has its roots in much earlier 20th-century structures from around the world, particularly those of Swiss architect Le Corbusier, whose work prioritized functionality and large, sculptural shapes. Born in the UK, Broome grew up in Geneva, Switzerland, which first sparked her interest in Brutalism. \u201cWhere I grew up, there were a lot of mountains and concrete,\u201d she said, adding that in Geneva there were a lot of buildings by Le Corbusier: \u201cLooking back, (Brutalist buildings) feel like a homely space for me.\u201d The \u201cBrutalist Plants\u201d platform started as a hobby: Broome shared images on Tumblr before she moved it to Instagram in 2018. The account reposts the work of photographers, with tags and credits, and as the community has grown into the tens of thousands, many photographers and content creators now submit work to her. Broome was attracted to the images because of the contrast of the cold concrete with the softness of nature, which has an ambiguous \u201cdystopian or utopian feel.\u201d \u201cA lot of them are quite modernist, which is a bit more like a utopia,\u201d said Broome. Some of the photos imagine \u201chow we could be living, with plants or balconies,\u201d and the inclusion of architectural renders and AI-generated scenes show hopeful visions of our stark urban world co-existing peacefully alongside nature. On the flip side, some of them have a darker feeling. \u201cThere are a few images in there where it\u2019s genuinely overgrown architectural spaces that no longer exist,\u201d she said, adding that many were submitted by urban explorers of abandoned buildings. People are notably absent from the photos; most of the images are only of architecture and nature, but in a few instances, Broome said humans have been removed from the images to focus the narrative on the built environment\u2019s relationship with nature, which Broome feels is muddled by human presence. \u201cNobody lives in the book, really. There are no human beings. It\u2019s just plants doing their thing,\u201d she added. Controversial structures Featuring 150 photos of buildings, artworks and sculptures, the book includes a mix of images shared on the Instagram account and unseen photos sourced elsewhere, said Broome. With 41 countries featured in the book, Broome is excited to show the huge spread and variety of Brutalist works, and the architectural style\u2019s influence on more recent structures and artworks. One of the \u201cmost contested images\u201d Broome shared with her audience on Instagram, which has also made the cut for the book, is of a sculpture by German artist Karsten Fo\u0308dinger. \u201cIt\u2019s this slab of concrete that sits slightly slanted, held up by pine trees in a row. It kind of looks like a table of concrete that\u2019s attached to these trees,\u201d explained Broome. Online, some people commented it was \u201cawful for the trees\u201d and an affront to nature, while others felt the unity of concrete and wood \u2014\u00a0commonly used in house building \u2014 reflected ideas of shelter and put an artistic twist on it. \u201cThere was a lot of debate back and forth,\u201d said Broome. A lot of the images hold special meaning for Broome: a photograph of a building in Geneva is \u201ctwo minute\u2019s walk\u201d from where her father lives, and some of the buildings photographed in Melbourne and Canberra in Australia are places she\u2019s visited with family and friends. Broome, who moved back to London to study design and journalism at university, now lives in the UK where there are many Brutalist buildings to provide inspiration \u2014\u00a0including the Barbican Theatre, where the book will be launched. She believes Brutalist structures should be preserved for the future \u2014 and the integration of nature shows their adaptability. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Brutalist (architecture) that is endangered because people don\u2019t see the value,\u201d she said. \u201c(But) there are more architects, and some feature in the book, that are working to make brutalism more accessible and more beautiful, and really showcase what it can do for different spaces.\u201d Brutalist Plants, published by Hoxton Mini Press, is out on May 16, 2024", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/brutalist-plant-photos-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_island-time-zone-maldives-resorts-intl-hnk", "text": "It may be true that Maldives\u2019 luxury resorts really do have it all \u2013 the turquoise water, the rich marine life, and, in some cases, their own time system. Referred to as \u201cisland time,\u201d it isn\u2019t a figurative saying that invites guests to relax and forget about the passing minutes. Many resorts move their clocks at least one hour ahead of the country\u2019s official time zone \u2013 which is five hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT+5). \u201cThis deliberate time adjustment is more than a mere quirk of travel; it is a thoughtful enhancement to the guest experience, catering to the diverse needs of our international visitors,\u201d Mohit Dembla, general manager of the\u00a0JW Marriott Maldives Resort & Spa\u00a0tells CNN Travel. The JW Marriott is one of four Maldives properties under the Marriott Group umbrella, alongside the St. Regis Maldives Vommuli Resort, the Westin Maldives Miriandhoo Resort and the Ritz-Carlton Maldives, Fari Islands. All four resorts observe Island Time. More daylight activities and sunset dinners While this single-hour shift might not seem like a big deal to those who live in places where the days are long, it makes a big difference when you\u2019re on holiday and there are only so many hours of daylight to squeeze things into. \u201cSince most resorts in the Maldives are located on their own private islands, and often miles away from mainland Mal\u00e9, they frequently operate according to their own rules, namely the \u2018island time\u2019 so travelers may take advantage of an extra hour of daylight each day to fully indulge at the resort,\u201d explains Zhilah Vego, director of sales and marketing at the St. Regis Maldives Vommuli Resort. The time adjustment means the sun rises at 7 a.m. at the resorts instead of 6 a.m. \u2013 the official Maldives time. Soneva, another luxury resort group with multiple properties around the Maldives, also sets the clocks at its resorts an hour ahead of Male Time. Instead of the word \u201cisland,\u201d they name the clock shift after each of its properties. (Soneva Jani calls it \u201cSoneva Jani Time,\u201d for example.) \u201cWith the sun rising at 7 a.m. and setting at 7:15 p.m., our guests enjoy perfectly timed daylight for early morning jogs or cool evening sports, escaping the peak heat of the day,\u201d says Charles Morris, GM of Soneva Jani. \u201cThis also gifts them the serene beauty of dusk till 7:45 p.m., perfect for witnessing spectacular sunsets on South Beach.\u201d Staff at other resorts have similar explanations, telling CNN the unofficial time zone helps their guests enjoy more outdoor activities before sundown and bask in the sunset at dinner. Special activities are often planned for those golden hours. The Westin Maldives Miriandhoo Resort, for instance, hosts sunrise yoga and run sessions \u2013 dubbed WestinRun. The Ritz-Carlton Maldives, Fari Islands serves dinner at its poolside bar with a sunset Maldivian boduberu drum performance, whereas the St. Regis sabers a bottle of Champagne at 6:45 p.m. for their guests. Widespread as it is, island time may still come as a shock for Maldives\u2019 first-time visitors, particularly as they try to balance relaxation with reality and worry about transfers back to the airport to catch their flight home. St. Regis staff tell CNN they understand guests might be confused by the conversion. To remedy this, dedicated butlers inform the guests of island time ahead of their stays and help coordinate the time conversations and transfers, especially from the airport to the resort. Not every island resort follows island time Not every resort in the Maldives follows island time. That includes Kurumba, which holds the honor of being the country\u2019s very first resort. \u201cHere at Kurumba Maldives we don\u2019t use island time and never have, simply because as the first resort in the Maldives the concept of island time didn\u2019t exist,\u201d says Ali Farooq, resort manager at Kurumba, which opened in 1972. \u201cLots of our team members commute from Mal\u00e9 so we also like to respect their work-life balance, and our experience is that guests find it more convenient and less confusing to be on one time zone. Kurumba is only a short speedboat ride from the airport so they don\u2019t lose any time when staying here.\u201d An archipelago made up of 1,190 low-lying islands, the Maldives stretches out over 90,000 square kilometers. The majority of the nation\u2019s 160-plus resorts sit on individual islands, many of which are accessed by\u00a0float plane\u00a0from Velana International\u00a0Airport in the capital, Male. These planes can\u2019t fly after dark, so daylight hours are precious. Over the years, resorts in other countries have created their own time zones for various reasons, but the Maldives certainly has the most of them. For JW Marriott\u2019s Dembla, it all comes down to the traveler\u2019s experience. \u201c(The resort) is not just about providing luxury accommodations and services; It\u2019s about curating an environment where time itself is attuned to the comfort and preferences of our esteemed visitors,\u201d he says. \u201cIt reflects the unhurried pace and relaxed attitude characteristic of island communities, enriching the overall travel experience.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/island-time-zone-maldives-resorts-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_19_middleeast_iranian-president-raisi-helicopter-intl", "text": "Rescuers are searching in the dark for a helicopter that crashed while carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in northern Iran on Sunday, according to Iranian officials. Raisi\u2019s condition and that of Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who was also on board, remain unknown as overnight temperatures drop in the mountainous area. The aircraft came down in the early afternoon in Iran\u2019s East Azerbaijan province, sparking a massive search effort, including military drones and dozens of rescue teams, state media reported. Officials have said they were able to make contact with some of the passengers aboard the helicopter and Turkish drone has located a heat source. But despite hours of searching, emergency crews have not been able to reach the crash site amid reported fog and extreme cold. A regional commander for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced late on Sunday night that they had detected the exact location of the crash after receiving a signal from the helicopter and the mobile phone of one of the crew, IRNA reported. \u201cMilitary forces are heading to the location and hope to have some good news,\u201d the commander reportedly said. The incident comes at a sensitive time domestically for Tehran and seven months into Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza that has sent tensions soaring throughout the Middle East and brought a decades long shadow war between Israel and Iran out into the open. Last month Iran launched an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel \u2014 its first ever direct attack on the country \u2014 in response to a deadly apparent Israeli airstrike on\u00a0Iran\u2019s consulate in Damascus. Iran\u2019s hardline leadership has faced significant challenges in recent years, convulsed by youth-led demonstrations against clerical rule and grim economic conditions. Iranian authorities have launched a widening crackdown on dissent since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran\u2019s notorious morality police. Raisi\u2019s official Instagram account and state television have urged Iranians to pray for the president and his entourage. Iranian Supreme Leader\u00a0Ayatollah Khamenei, the country\u2019s top leader, echoed in the call in a video statement, saying, \u201cEveryone should pray for the health of this group of servants. \u2026 People of Iran, do not worry. There will be no disruption in the work of the country.\u201d Poor weather complicates search for helicopter The accident occurred as Raisi and Amir Abdollahian were returning from a ceremony for an opening of a dam on Iran\u2019s border with Azerbaijan, IRNA reported. Seven other people were also in the helicopter, according to the IRGC-run media outlet Sepah, including a local imam, the provincial governor, security staff and the helicopter\u2019s crew. Two other helicopters in the same convoy of dignitaries arrived at their destinations safely, officials said. Iranian authorities have identified a 2-kilometer radius for the crash site and believe the accident was \u201cnot severe\u201d after speaking with two people who were traveling on the downed helicopter, Iranian Vice President for Executive\u00a0Affairs\u00a0Mohsen Mansouri told Iranian semi-official FARS\u00a0news. \u201cThree helicopters were on this route, but the helicopter carrying the President lost contact with the other two. They began searching and established contact with one of the helicopter\u2019s occupants and the flight crew, indicating the incident was not severe. The Red Crescent, FRAJA, Army, and IRGC rescue teams have arrived and divided tasks,\u201d he said. The crash site is believed to be somewhere in the Dizmar Forest area between the villages of Ozi and Pir Davood, according to IRNA, which reported that residents in the northern Varzeqan region said they heard noises from the area. Poor weather and low visibility are complicating rescue efforts in the rural area. Iranian Minister of Health, Bahram Eynollahi, has warned that the crash site is very foggy, making it difficult for rescuers to search. \u201cWe have set up treatment facilities. We are now in the area and all rescue forces are busy searching,\u201d Eynollahi said on state TV Sunday. \u201cWe have deployed all medical facilities, including emergency medicine, surgery and ambulance.\u201d A deployment of helicopters in the area has already failed due to the weather, Iranian military officials said. \u201cThe helicopters of the 6th combat base of Tabriz Air Force arrived in the Varzeqan area according to the order to carry out relief operations,\u201d the\u00a0Commander of Iran\u2019s 6th Air Force Base said. \u201cThese helicopters, along with the rescue team, were sent to the helicopter accident area of the president\u2019s convoy from the early hours. Unfortunately, the operation failed due to unfavorable weather conditions.\u201d Iraq and Azerbaijan have offered assistance to Iran in the ongoing search operation. In response to requests from Iranian authorities, the European Union said it was activating its satellite mapping service, and Turkey said it would send a night-vision search and rescue helicopter, plus 32 mountaineer search and rescue personnel. Russia has also pledged to send two planes with 50 professional mountain rescuers to help reach the crash site on Monday, IRNA reported. US President Joe Biden has been briefed on the incident, according to the White House. Who is President Raisi? Raisi\u2019s powers as President are\u00a0dwarfed by those of\u00a0Supreme Leader\u00a0Ali Khamenei, who is the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic. But Raisi is widely seen as a figure in which the Iranian\u00a0clerical\u00a0establishment has heavily invested \u2013 and even as a potential successor to the 85-year-old Khamenei. Raisi\u2019s election\u00a0in 2021\u00a0was heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic\u2019s political elite so that he would run virtually uncontested. He seemed to be made in the image of the 1979 Islamic Revolution\u2019s ideals, a guarantor of its continuation even as many chafed under its ultraconservative rules. A year into his tenure, he brutally quashed a youth-led uprising over repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab, and continued to stamp out dissent in its aftermath. Unlike his predecessor, the moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, there has been no daylight between Raisi and Khamenei.\u00a0This left\u00a0no doubt in many Iranians\u2019 minds that he has been groomed to be elevated to the Supreme Leadership. Any disruption to this vision of succession could sow further chaos in a country already buckling under significant economic and political strain.

{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_icc-israel-hamas-arrest-warrant-war-crimes-intl", "text": "The International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, the court\u2019s prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Monday. Khan said the ICC\u2019s prosecution team is also seeking warrants for Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as two other top Hamas leaders \u2014 Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades\u00a0who is\u00a0better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019 political leader. The warrants against the Israeli politicians mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. The decision puts Netanyahu in the company of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant\u00a0over\u00a0Moscow\u2019s war\u00a0on\u00a0Ukraine, and the Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, who was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture and killing in October 2011. By applying for the arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders in the same action, Khan\u2019s office risks attracting criticism that it places a terror organization and an elected government on an equivalent footing. A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. Khan said the charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri include \u201cextermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention.\u201d \u201cThe world was shocked on the 7th of October when people were ripped from their bedrooms, from their homes, from the different kibbutzim in Israel,\u201d Khan told Amanpour, adding that \u201cpeople have suffered enormously.\u201d Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people across several locations in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. Many of the hostages are still being held in Gaza \u2013 Khan told Amanpour this meant crimes continued to be committed against \u201cso many innocent Israelis \u2026 that are held hostage by Hamas and families that are waiting for their return.\u201d Khan told Amanpour his team has a \u201cvariety of evidence\u201d to support the application for arrest warrants against Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri, including authenticated video footage and photographs from the attacks as well as evidence from eyewitnesses and survivors. Khan said Israel had \u201cevery right and indeed an obligation to get hostages back, but you must do so by complying with the law.\u201d Responding to the announcement by Khan, Hamas said in a statement that it \u201cstrongly condemns the attempts of the ICC Prosecutor to equate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against a number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis.\u201d \u201cHamas\u00a0calls on the ICC Prosecutor to issue arrest warrants against all war criminals among the occupation leaders, officers, and soldiers who participated in crimes against the Palestinian people, and demands the cancellation of all arrest warrants issued against Palestinian resistance leaders,\u201d the group added. \u2018Nobody is above the law\u2019 The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include \u201ccausing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,\u201d Khan told Amanpour. \u201cThe fact that Hamas fighters need water doesn\u2019t justify denying water from all the civilian population of Gaza,\u201d he added. More than 35,500 Palestinians have been killed and more than 79,000 wounded in Gaza since October 7, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Monday. CNN cannot independently verify the figures. Netanyahu called the decision \u201ca political outrage.\u201d \u201cThey will not deter us and we will continue in the war until the hostages are released and Hamas is destroyed,\u201d he said at a meeting of the parliamentary group of his Likud party. Other Israeli officials echoed his sentiments. Benny Gantz, a member Israel\u2019s war cabinet, criticized Khan\u2019s decision immediately after it was announced, saying that Israel was fighting \u201cwith one of the strictest moral codes in history, while complying with international law and boasting a robust independent judiciary.\u201d \u201cDrawing parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,\u201d he said, adding that the decision by the prosecutors \u201cis in itself a crime of historic proportion to be remembered for generation.\u201d The leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, said the application for the arrest warrents was \u201ca complete moral failure.\u201d \u201cWe cannot accept the outrageous comparison between Netanyahu and Sinwar \u2026 We will not remain silent,\u201d he said.  Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog called it \u201cbeyond outrageous.\u201d When reports surfaced last month that the ICC chief prosecutor was considering this course of action,\u00a0Netanyahu said\u00a0that any ICC arrest warrants against senior Israeli government and military officials \u201cwould be an outrage of historic proportions,\u201d and that Israel \u201chas an independent legal system that rigorously investigates all violations of the law.\u201d Asked by Amanpour about the comments made by Netanyahu, Khan said: \u201cNobody is above the law.\u201d He said that if Israel disagrees with the ICC, \u201cthey are free, notwithstanding their objections to jurisdiction, to raise a challenge before the judges of the court and that\u2019s what I advise them to do.\u201d Israel and the United States are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. The ICC announcement on Monday is separate from the case that is currently being heard by the the International Court of Justice\u00a0(ICJ) over an\u00a0accusation from South Africa\u00a0that Israel was committing genocide in its war against Hamas following the October 7 attacks. While the ICJ considers cases that involve countries and nations, and the ICC is a\u00a0criminal\u00a0court, which brings cases against individuals for war crimes or crimes against humanity. Monday\u2019s announcement is not the first time that the ICC acted in relation to Israel. In March 2021, Khan\u2019s office launched an investigation into possible crimes committed in the Palestinian territories since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank. Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute first brought before the United Nations, the ICC operates independently. Most countries \u2013 124 of them \u2013 are parties to the treaty, but there are notable exceptions, including Israel, the US and Russia. That means that if the court grants Khan\u2019s application and issues arrest warrants for the five men, any country that is a member would have to arrest them and extradite them to The Hague.

{"id": "2024_05_19_sport_jurgen-klopp-liverpool-farewell-spt-intl", "text": "The journey\u2019s end was as expected for someone so revered. How could there not be tears for a man who traded on emotion and transformed Liverpool Football Club, bringing hope first then glory during his near nine-year stay? On a sun-soaked Sunday at Anfield, Jurgen Klopp managed Liverpool for the last time and salty tears filled eyes; from the man himself to his players and fans. Klopp announced at the beginning of the year that this season would be his last for Liverpool. It was time, he said. Liverpool\u2019s fans, on the other hand, have ever since reluctantly been preparing themselves for this day. The club announced on Monday that Arne Slot will replace Klopp after leaving his role at Feyenoord. The Dutch coach will take up the position officially on June 1, subject to a work permit. On Sunday, thousands lined the streets as the team bus made its way to Anfield, flares tinting the air with Liverpool red. A mural of Klopp\u2019s name adorned one stand before the match and fans waved \u201cnormal one\u201d flags, referencing his description of himself at his first press conference as Liverpool manager. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to take as a human being,\u201d Klopp told Sky Sports before the match of the adoration bestowed on him. But more was to follow. He was serenaded throughout the match, one which Liverpool won 2-0 against Wolves \u2013 not that the day was about results. For the last 10 minutes fans increased the decibels, the idolization, to such an extent that Klopp could no longer hold back the tears. Television cameras panned to his wife, Ulla, who was also crying in the stands. It would be easy to rattle off the trophies Liverpool have won since Klopp arrived at Anfield in October 2015 \u2013 a Premier League title, the Champions League, the FA Cup, two League Cups and more \u2013 but his impact on the club cannot be quantified in silverware alone. \u201cA man who made a seismic impact on this city and its people,\u201d the stadium announcer said as Klopp walked onto the pitch for his post-match presentation. There were many trophies, arguably there should have been more \u2013 two Champions League finals lost, a Europa League final lost, the Premier League lost by a point. But, for Liverpool\u2019s fans, this gregarious German brought joy back to the club, lifting a team which was mid-table when he took over to the higher echelons of European soccer. He  created one of the greatest teams in the club\u2019s history \u2013 one that won trophies and played with verve and, in 2020, ended a 30-year wait for a league title. At the final whistle Klopp hugged his players, and some opposition players, too. Captain Virgil van Dijk looked close to tears on their embrace. \u201cI\u2019ve got no words, it\u2019s a very emotional day,\u201d said Van Dijk told Sky Sports. Upon his arrival, Klopp said he was \u201cthe normal one,\u201d but he is, in truth, anything but. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely the special one,\u201d goalkeeper Allison told Sky Sports afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful and grateful that I had the opportunity to work under Jurgen Klopp.\u201d The matchday programme had \u201cDanke Jurgen\u201d written on the cover. What more could Liverpool fans say? \u201c\u2026 as much as I know it is the right time for me to leave I know also that it will take some getting used to,\u201d Klopp wrote in his programme notes. It will arguably take Liverpool fans, and even the Premier League, longer to get used to a post-Klopp era. The stadium remained full after the final whistle as fans stayed to listen to Klopp\u2019s farewell speech. \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone,\u201d the club\u2019s anthem rang around the stadium one last time for the German. Trent Alexander-Arnold, who has not played for any other manager, was in tears. No one wanted to leave because that would mean it was the end. \u201cThis season we aimed for the moon and ended up in the stars,\u201d Klopp wrote of a campaign which promised a quadruple of trophies but ended with the League Cup and a third-placed finish in the league. There will be no one else like Klopp. After all, few managers get to choose their ending in such a high-pressured sport. The Klopp era will not be replicated, Liverpool fans know that, which is why he was given such a special farewell.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/sport/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-farewell-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

The unanimous ruling capped months long speculation and legal wrangling on whether the former leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), turned thorn in its side and public face of a rival party, would be able to stand for the country\u2019s top legislative body. Zuma was forced to resign as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals and internal infighting in the ANC. He was found guilty of contempt of court by the same constitutional court for his refusal to testify to an anti-corruption commission. It is that sentence that barred him from running, the court ruled on Monday. \u201c(Zuma) Is accordingly not eligible to be a member of and not qualified to stand for election to the national assembly until five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence,\u201d read Justice Leona Theron. \u201cWe welcomed the judgement, and we think it is well reasoned. A contempt of court sentence is an extremely important sentence, and it is a sentence that cannot be treated lightly. The constitutional court has reaffirmed this,\u201d said Neeshan Balton, of the Ahmed Kathrada foundation on local television.

{"id": "2024_05_17_africa_tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc", "text": "Despite her extraordinary success in Afrobeats music, Tiwa Savage has long harbored a secret aspiration: to pursue a career in acting. \u201cActing, I would say, was my first love before music,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo during a recent interview in Lagos. At 44, the multifaceted, award-winning Nigerian artist has transformed her dreams into reality. On May 10, her much-anticipated debut film, \u201cWater & Garri,\u201d hit Prime Video, marking her leap into acting. Executive produced by Savage and directed by her long-time music video director Meji Alabi, \u201cWater & Garri\u201d is a collaboration between Everything Savage, Unbound Studios, and JM Films. The concept was born from Savage\u2019s idea to create a visual album for her 2021 EP of the same name. Because of that, it \u201cinitially it was only supposed to be like a short film,\u201d Savage said, \u201cand then it grew on its own and took its own identity.\u201d Written by Comfort Emmanuel, the film is set in a fictional town on the Cape Coast of Ghana and follows a determined fashion designer named Aisha (Savage) who returns to her hometown due to a family tragedy after a decade in the US. However, upon her return home, she finds her once familiar surroundings altered by escalating violence and heightened tensions. As she reconnects with her family, old friends, and a former flame, Aisha must confront her past and face the guilt of what she left behind \u2013 an experience Savage says drew parallels to her own life. \u201cWe both felt like we had to go somewhere to chase our dreams,\u201d said Savage, who spent two weeks in intensive training in London to prepare for the role of Aisha. \u201cIt was just to break me out of my shell, to break me out of Tiwa Savage and just empty me out \u2013 and then just allow me to be or embody like a whole different character,\u201d she added. Experimenting with a new sound As the production of the film pressed forward, Savage didn\u2019t only shed her superstar persona, she moved on from the initial musical inspiration for the film, instead opting to create an original soundtrack for the movie. \u201cIt was supposed to include the first five songs on the EP; by the time we finished filming, it just took on a whole different identity, and we just created a whole new soundtrack,\u201d the singer explained. The album served as a platform for Savage to push her vocal boundaries and delve into new musical genres. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been boxed to a certain sound because I\u2019ve done it for over 10 years,\u201d Savage said. The 10-song soundtrack included collaborations with French Nigerian singer Asa on the folk song \u201cEmotions,\u201d\u00a0American gospel artist Zacardi Cortez on \u201cI Need You,\u201d and Richard Bona & The Cavemen on the jazz track \u201cWater & Garri.\u201d \u201cCreating the soundtrack allowed me to explore those different genres, and I think I didn\u2019t feel like I would have been able to do that as Tiwa Savage,\u201d she said. \u201c(So) I was able to explore those pockets of my talent.\u201d \u00a0 The singer admits she has always loved Jazz, R&B, and gospel music, but after acting in \u201cWater & Garri\u201d and performing the soundtrack, she says has discovered how much she has grown as an artist and feels encouraged to be limitless in her creativity. \u201cI\u2019m not limiting myself to the sound that people know me for; I\u2019ve definitely grown even in a performance \u2013 like I used to have a lot of dances and do routines,\u201d the singer-turned-actress explained. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m more about vocal delivery,\u201d she added. \u201cGoing forward from that \u2026 I feel like I can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/africa/tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_weather_flooding-south-storms-houston-friday", "text": "At least seven people were killed in the Houston area on Thursday as a destructive complex of storms with winds up to 100 mph tore through the area, triggering power outages that could stretch on for weeks amid soaring temperatures. The death toll rose Friday evening from the four fatalities officials reported earlier in the day. More than 900,000 homes and businesses lost power in Houston\u2019s Harris County during the peak of the storm\u2019s violent winds, and nearly 600,000 remained in the dark Friday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. \u201cFor some folks, the luckier ones, (power restoration) might be days, not hours. For many, many people, it\u2019s going to be weeks and not days,\u201d Harris County Judge Lina Hildago said in a Friday news briefing. Hidalgo said the weeks-long restoration timeframe was for homes and businesses tied into the 10 steel power transmission towers downed in the state, seven of which were in Harris County. It\u2019s unclear which areas are tied into the transmission lines, she said. It\u2019s a troubling timeframe for power restoration, especially as high temperatures reach the 90s through the weekend and beyond. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit the triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. The City of Houston planned to activate cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. Fallen trees appear to have caused two of the reported deaths, and a crane accident caused another, Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said in a news conference. The Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Friday evening identified three others in the county who died from the storm. One man collapsed while attempting to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and caused a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X Friday. Gonzales said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank. \u201cHe was found unresponsive this morning and pronounced deceased at the scene,\u201d the sheriff said Friday, adding the additional deaths occurred in unincorporated Harris County. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said.  Additional powerful, drenching storms could plague parts of the Gulf Coast Friday. Here\u2019s the latest on Friday\u2019s storms and destruction in Texas and other parts of the South: Thursday\u2019s severe weather classified as derecho: The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The Storm Prediction Center and several National Weather Service offices made the determination based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. Most of Houston\u2019s traffic lights are down: Traffic lights across the city are out and debris from damaged buildings and toppled trees are covering roadways, making driving conditions dangerous. \u201cDowntown is a mess. It\u2019s dangerous due to the glass and the lack of traffic lights. So stay at home,\u201d Mayor Whitmire said Thursday. Hurricane-force wind gusts reported in Texas and Louisiana: Wind speeds reached as high as 100 mph in downtown Houston, a National Weather Service storm damage survey crew determined Friday. Wind gusts of 74 to 78 mph were measured just east of the Houston metro\u00a0Thursday evening,\u00a0according to the weather service. The National Weather Service in New Orleans reported wind gusts as strong as 84 mph around the city. Major flooding leads to water rescues: There were up to 20 water rescues after residents in Bryan, Texas, drove into the floodwaters, police spokesperson Seth Waller said. Nearby in College Station, heavy rain Thursday flooded a park, videos shared with CNN showed. Roads flooded in several Texas counties including Bosque, Bell, McLennan and Falls. Waterlogged parts of Texas and Louisiana recorded widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches in just a few hours late Thursday and early Friday morning. Spate of storms exhausts Texas: The Lone Star State has been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of flooding downpours. Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday requested a presidential disaster declaration for areas impacted by the onslaught of severe weather and flooding, citing \u201cextensive damage caused by these severe storms, historic river flooding, and tornadoes\u201d that began on April 26. Houston area bears brunt of destructive storms Houston\u2019s mayor advised residents to stay off the roads and stay at home because of widespread damage to the area. \u201cMany roads are impassable due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d Mayor Whitmire\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. The storm was so powerful it blew out the windows of buildings in downtown Houston, littering the area with glass as traffic lights went dark. Shoppers at a Costco in Houston used their phones as the only source of light as they huddled inside the store when the power went out, with employees closing the doors to block out the rain and winds. The violent storm conditions partially collapsed a nightclub and partially ripped roofing off the downtown Hyatt Regency, showering the hotel lobby with rain and debris, according to witness video. CenterPoint Energy says its skyscraper in downtown Houston sustained damage from the storm, according to a spokesperson. The Houston Independent School District announced campuses will be closed on Friday and reopen Monday \u201cdue to widespread damage across Houston.\u201d More than a dozen Houston-area school districts also announced they would close Friday, including Aldine Independent School District, Channelview Independent School District and Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District. More damaging storms possible Friday Damaging, soaking storms were ongoing in parts of the Gulf Coast Friday morning following Thursday night\u2019s violent weather. Additional storms will usher in renewed threats later Friday. A Level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from southern Louisiana to parts of Georgia and Florida. Any of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and even a tornado. Storms will also unload gushing rainfall. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for portions of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The heaviest rain late Friday will likely fall during the overnight hours. Storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. Some areas could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours.

Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Cracks in walls and falling cornices were reported, Italy\u2019s Fire Brigade spokesman confirmed to CNN. The 4.4 earthquake at a depth of 3 kilometers is the strongest earthquake to hit the highly seismic area in the past 40 years, according to INGV data. The quake is part of an ongoing \u201cseismic storm\u201d that has seen more than a dozen events over 2.0 magnitude in the past 48 hours. The 4.4 tremblor at 8:10 p.m. local time was preceded by a 3.5 earthquake an hour earlier. The INGV recorded 1,252 earthquakes in the Campi Flegrei area in the month of April 2024, most with a magnitude less than 1.0. The last major eruption of the supervolcano was in 1538, which resulted in the creation of a new bay on the southern Italian coast. The INGV has noted an increase of seismic activity since 2022, which could be due either to the building up of magma under the surface or the building up of gases, according to several volcanologists. The volcano is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Mt. Vesuvius, and prone to a phenomenon known as bradyseism, during which the ground raises and falls due to pressure under the surface. The last major cycle was in 1984, but several volcanologists told CNN that the area is experiencing a new cycle of the phenomenon.

{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_blinken-rockin-free-world-scli-intl", "text": "There was no doubting the message from Antony Blinken\u2019s musical debut in Kyiv on Tuesday night. The US secretary of state made a surprise appearance on stage in a bar in Kyiv, as he appeared alongside Ukrainian band 19.99 in a rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World.\u201d Blinken, who played guitar with the punk/jazz band and even joined in on vocals, arrived in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday for a surprise trip, in which he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss battlefield updates and the importance of newly arrived US aid. The visit is the first by a Biden administration official since the long-delayed passage of US supplemental funding to the war-torn country. Perhaps even more of a surprise, however, was his appearance at Barman Dictat on Tuesday evening, a popular underground cocktail bar and music venue just off Kyiv\u2019s main street, Khreshchatyk. The bar, which has heavy metal doors and metal reinforcements along the walls, is popular with war veterans and soldiers on leave. In a personal address from the stage, Blinken said: \u201cThe United States is with you, so much of the world is with you. And they\u2019re fighting, not just for Ukraine but for the free world \u2013 and the free world is with you too.\u201d The venue posted about the unusual performance on its Instagram page, captioning it: \u201cKeep on rocking on a free world! Thanks @secblinken.\u201d The song was released by Neil Young in 1989 \u2013 the year the Berlin Wall fell \u2013 on his album entitled \u201cFreedom.\u201d Although Blinken did not share the footage \u2013 or even reference the event \u2013 on his social media, his profile describes him as a \u201c(very) amateur guitarist.\u201d Blinken is not the first US politician to show off his musical talents in a European music venue. Former President Bill Clinton played saxophone at the Reduta Jazz Club in Prague in 1994, after the fall of the Iron Curtain \u2013 and returned there to play again earlier this year.

The attempted coup, which targeted the residence of Congolese politician Vital Kamerhe and the country\u2019s presidential\u00a0palace,\u00a0was led\u00a0by opposition leader Christian Malanga, who was killed\u00a0in a gun battle between the armed putschists and the presidential guards, according to army spokesman General Sylvain Ekenge. Ekenge also claimed Malanga was a\u00a0US\u00a0citizen, though the State Department said later it had no records of him. \u201cI confirm the death of Christian Malanga neutralized during the exchange of fire at the Palais de la Nation (presidential palace),\u201d Ekenge told CNN, adding that Malanga\u2019s son Marcel, \u201cwas among those arrested.\u201d Ekenge named three other Americans, identified as Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, Patrick Ducey, and Taylor Thomson were involved in the foiled coup. \u201cPatrick Ducey and Taylor Thomson are the same person\u00a0who have\u00a0two different identities.

US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US is aware of two other individuals \u201creported to be\u201d US citizens who are in custody after the failed coup attempt. Miller said privacy laws prevented him from confirming whether or not the US had reached out to the Congolese government to be granted consular access to the two individuals. Videos widely shared on social media, but not verified by CNN, showed a man with a bloody face\u00a0being surrounded\u00a0by Congolese military personnel. US\u00a0ambassador to the DRC, Lucy Tamlyn, said in a post on social media platform X, that she was \u201cshocked\u201d by reports of the attempted coup, adding that her country \u201cwill cooperate with the DRC authorities to the fullest extent as they investigate these criminal acts and hold accountable any\u00a0US\u00a0citizen involved in criminal acts.\u201d It is not immediately known whether President Felix Tshisekedi, who secured re-election for a second term after last December\u2019s disputed\u00a0vote\u00a0was at the presidential palace during the attack. Sunday\u2019s incident was the second coup attempt by the now deceased Malanga, a former Congolese military veteran, Ekenge told CNN. \u201cHe tried it without success in 2017,\u201d Ekenge said but did not provide further details. Malanga, 41,\u00a0who had\u00a0been\u00a0exiled\u00a0in the\u00a0US, headed the United Congolese Party\u00a0which\u00a0describes itself as an \u201copposition political party-in-exile.\u201d Flanked by his son and other armed men in military fatigue, Malanga\u00a0was seen\u00a0in a live-streamed video posted on his Facebook page railing against Tshisekedi\u2019s government and Kamerhe on the morning of the attack, accusing them of doing \u201cmany stupid things in this country,\u201d\u00a0according to Reuters.

The local authority in Lauterbrunnen, a valley in Switzerland\u2019s mountainous Bernese Oberland region, has set up a working group to come up with new ways to curb overtourism, according to Swiss Info. The small and scenic community of Lauterbrunnen \u2013 which is home to less than 800 residents, according to the local authority \u2013 is grappling with congested streets, roads covered in trash and high rents. One idea being mulled over is the introduction of an entry free for some visitors, Swiss Info reported Thursday, citing local newspaper Berner Zeitung. The proposed charge, which would be paid through a smartphone app, would be between 5 and 10 Swiss francs ($5.50 to $10.99) and apply to visitors passing through for the day by car. \u201cThe exception would be guests who have booked an offer such as a hotel or an excursion or who arrive by public transport,\u201d Lauterbrunnen Mayor Karl\u00a0N\u00e4pflin said, according to Swiss Info. There are already more than 60 destinations around the world where this type of tax is already in place, and the introduction of such tourist taxes often prove controversial. The first day of the Venice entry charge on April 25 was met with protests by some locals who felt their home was being turned into a theme park. The famous city, which is at the global forefront of the move to charge day trippers specifically, will continue to pilot it until July 14. The valley of Lauterbrunnen is home to numerous attractions, including Staubbach Falls, one of Europe\u2019s highest unbroken waterfalls at 270 meters.

{"id": "2024_05_19_middleeast_netanyahu-israel-political-tensions-intl", "text": "Divisions and disagreements within the Israeli cabinet on the conduct and priorities of the war against Hamas have simmered since the onset of the crisis. Now they\u2019ve boiled over, revealing a new level of public vitriol - as well as an ultimatum from one of three members of the war cabinet \u2013 as the seven-month long conflict potentially enters a new phase. On Saturday Benny Gantz, the leader of the National Unity Party, who joined the war cabinet after Hamas\u2019 attack in October, demanded by June 8 the adoption of a six-point plan. That plan would secure the return of Israeli hostages, the demobilization of Hamas and the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip. It would also lead to the creation of an alternative government for Gaza, \u201can American-European-Arab-Palestinian administration\u201d that would \u201clay the foundation for a future alternative that is not Hamas or [Mahmoud] Abbas,\u201d the President of the Palestinian Authority. The Gantz plan would also ensure the return of residents displaced by attacks from Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, and measures to ensure ultra-orthodox Jews can be drafted into the military just like any other citizen. That has been a red line for the religious right in the Israeli cabinet. In an unveiled swipe at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Gantz, who is widely seen to be a leading contender to be the next Israeli leader, added that \u201cpersonal and political considerations have begun to penetrate into the holy of holies of Israel\u2019s security.\u201d \u201cIf you choose to lead the nation into the abyss, we will withdraw from the government, turn to the people, and form a government that can bring about a real victory.\u201d \u201cUnity cannot be a fig leaf for stagnation in the management of the campaign,\u201d Gantz added. Within hours the accusations were flying, laying bare the fissures in Israeli politics and the personal animosities that pervade the government. The prime minister\u2019s office shot back. \u201cThe conditions set by Benny Gantz are washed-up words whose meaning is clear: the end of the war and a defeat for Israel, the abandonment of most of the hostages, leaving Hamas intact and the establishment of a Palestinian state,\u201d it said in a statement. One far-right member of the cabinet, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, said Gantz was \u201ca small leader and big trickster, who, from the first moment of joining the government has chiefly been trying to dismantle it.\u201d He added: \u201cWhoever offered the ultra-Orthodox agreements on a conscription law in exchange for the dissolution of the government and now chants slogans about responsibility, is a hypocrite and a liar.\u201d From a very different point of view, opposition leader Yair Lapid said Gantz should act now. \u201cEnough with the press conferences, enough with the empty ultimatums, get out! If you weren\u2019t sitting in the government, we would already be in the post Netanyahu and Ben Gvir era,\u201d he said. Gantz\u2019s broadside did not come in isolation. Last week, the third member of the war cabinet, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, spoke of decisions that he said should have been made at the start of the war. He also said: \u201cI will not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza. Israel must not establish civilian rule in Gaza.\u201d Illusion of unity shattered It\u2019s against this background of internecine warfare that Israeli troops continue to fight in Gaza, unsure of how their mission will end and of any plan for the day after the guns fall silent. Gantz himself made reference to this Saturday, saying that \u201cwhile the Israeli soldiers show supreme bravery on the front - some of the people who sent them into battle behave with cowardice and irresponsibility.\u201d Israeli commentators Sunday said the illusion of unity within the cabinet that had been fostered in the early phase of the conflict had been shattered. The Jerusalem Post reported Sunday that the comments were remarkable in that for the first time, \u201cGantz publicly accused the prime minister of prioritizing his political survival over the nation\u2019s interests. For the first time, he set a clear deadline for remaining in the government.\u201d Writing in Haaretz, Anshel Pfeffer said that whoever had written Gantz\u2019s speech \u201cdid nothing more than recycle the dozens of leaks on the divisions within the war cabinet over the past few months.\u201d Pfeffer, author of the unauthorized biography \u201cBibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu,\u201d says the bottom line, at the end of a week of political turmoil, is that \u201cof the three war cabinet members\u2026two have now publicly accused the third member, Netanyahu, of not having a strategy for a war that has been ongoing for seven and a half months.\u201d Despite all this, Pfeffer and other analysts contend that the status quo may persist, because for Netanyahu, the presence of Gantz and Gallant in the three-man war cabinet provides protection from right-wing members of the larger cabinet. Some of them want Israel to rebuild settlements in Gaza and a much more aggressive approach in the north. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who wants the Israeli military to take control of Gaza after Hamas is liquidated, on Sunday also called for Israeli forces to enter and establish a security zone in southern Lebanon should Hezbollah rocket attacks continue. On Saturday night, Gantz told Netanyahu: \u201cI look into your eyes tonight and I tell you - the choice is in your hands.\u201d He said the moment of truth had arrived. Has it? Over the next three weeks, compromise may yet keep the war cabinet intact. And Gantz is not part of the broader coalition government, which means his potential withdrawal from the war cabinet would not automatically trigger a collapse of Netanyahu\u2019s government. It would, however, leave the prime minister more exposed to the demands of far-right- members of his cabinet. All this comes at a time of daily protests in Israel, from those calling for immediate elections to those demanding that securing the hostages\u2019 release should be the absolute priority, and those wanting an end to further humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza. And at a time when the Israeli military is fighting in north, central and southern Gaza, and preparing for what may be the toughest phase of the campaign to date.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-political-tensions-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_style_isabella-gardner-heist-facts", "text": "Most art galleries and museums are famous for the art they contain. London\u2019s National Gallery has Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d; \u201cThe Starry Night\u201d meanwhile, is held at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, in good company alongside Salvador Dal\u00ec\u2019s melting clocks, Andy Warhol\u2019s soup cans and Frida Kahlo\u2019s self-portrait. The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, however, is now more famous for the artwork that is not there, or at least, that is no longer there. On March 18 1990 the museum fell prey to history\u2019s biggest art heist. Thirteen works of art estimated to be worth over half a billion dollars \u2014 including three Rembrandts and a Vermeer \u2014 were stolen in the middle of the night, while the two security guards sat in the basement bound in duct tape. A new episode of CNN\u2019s \u201cHow It Really Happened\u201d airing Sunday 19 May at 9P ET/ PT features an interview with one of those guards: Rick Abath, who gave his only TV interview to CNN in 2013, and who died in February 2024 aged 57. The robbery is a treasure trove of surprising facts and unexpected plot twists. Here are five things that make the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and its famous theft, so interesting. The woman behind the building Isabella Stewart Gardner, the museum\u2019s founder and namesake, is a fascinating character. The daughter and eventual widow of two successful businessmen, Gardner was a philanthropist and art collector who built the museum to house her stash. \u201cWhen she opened the museum in 1903 she mandated that it be free of charge, to gain the appreciation and the attendance of all of Boston,\u201d Stephan Kurkjian, author of \u201cMaster Thieves: The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World\u2019s Greatest Art Heist\u201d, told CNN in the programme. \u201cHer museum, at that point in time, was the largest collection of art by a private individual in America.\u201d Gardner also had links to the fledgling campaign for women\u2019s political rights. The museum displays the photographs and letters of her friend Julia Ward Howe, an organizer of two US suffrage societies, and a print of Ethel Smyth, a composer and close friend of the English Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst. Gardner met Smyth through their mutual friend, the painter John Singer Sargent, whose portrait of Gardener raised eyebrows for the low-cut neckline he gave her. Gardner seemed to enjoy flirting with scandal and gossip: she once arrived at a Boston Symphony Orchestra performance in a hat band emblazoned with the name of her favorite baseball team, Red Sox, and an illustration in a January 1897 edition of the Boston Globe showed her apparently taking one of Boston Zoo\u2019s lions for a walk. Somewhat ironically, when the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911, Gardner told her museum guards that, if they saw anyone trying to rob them, they should shoot to kill. The art not taken The thieves\u2019 loot is estimated to be worth over half a billion dollars. However, they left the building\u2019s most expensive artifact: \u201cThe Rape of Europa\u201d by Titian, which Gardner bought from a London art gallery in 1896, then a record price for an old master painting. Why commit history\u2019s greatest art heist and leave without the priciest piece in the museum? Well, size may have played a role. The largest artwork taken was Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cChrist in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee,\u201d famous for being Rembrandt\u2019s only seascape and measures roughly 5x4 feet. \u201cThe Rape of Europa,\u201d meanwhile, is larger, at nearly 6x7 feet. The Napoleon factor Around 2005, the investigation into the stolen artworks took a detour to the French island of Corsica in the Meditteranean Sea. Two Frenchmen with alleged ties to the Corsican mob were trying to sell two paintings: a Rembrandt and a Vermeer. Former FBI Special Agent Bob Wittman was involved in a sting to try and buy them \u2014 but the operation eventually fell apart when the men were arrested for selling art taken from the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Nice instead. Why would \u201cCorsican mobsters,\u201d as CNN correspondent Randi Kaye described them in the programme, be interested in robbing a Boston art museum? The answer could lie in the Bronze Eagle Finial, the 10-inch ornament stolen from the top of a Napoleonic flag during the heist. \u201cIt was sort of an odd choice for the thieves to take (the Finial),\u201d Kaye said, \u201cbut it turns out that Corsica is essentially the homeland of Napoleon.\u201d The French emperor was born on the island in 1769, and a national museum is now housed in his former family home. \u201cIt is a very compelling notion,\u201d Kelly Horan, Deputy Editor of the Boston Globe, said in the programme, \u201cthat a Corsican band of gangsters might have tried to steal back their flag and pull off the entire rest of the heist in the process.\u201d A rock\u2019n\u2019roll suspect March 18 1990 was not the first time a Rembrandt had been stolen from a Boston museum. In 1975, career criminal and art thief Myles Connor walked into Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, and walked out with a Rembrandt tucked into his oversized coat pocket. He was the FBI\u2019s first suspect in the Gardner case, however the walls of federal prison \u2014 where he was incarcerated on drugs charges \u2014 gave him a pretty solid alibi. When he wasn\u2019t lifting famous artworks from their displays, Connor was a musician. It was through gigging that he met Al Dotoli, who worked with stars including Frank Sinatra and Liza Minelli. In 1976 Connor was jailed for a separate art theft committed in Maine. Hoping to use his stolen Rembrandt to leverage a lesser sentence, he needed Dotoli \u2014 who was on tour with Dionne Warwick \u2014 to turn the painting in to the authorities on his behalf. An invisible thief? One of the stolen artworks, \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s \u201cChez Tortoni,\u201d was taken from the museum\u2019s Blue Room on the first floor. The painting stands out for two reasons, the first being its frame. The thieves left almost all of the frames behind, cutting some out of the front. \u201cTo even leave remnants of the painting(s) behind was savage,\u201d Horan said. \u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s sort of like slashing someone\u2019s throat.\u201d The \u201cChez Tortoni\u201d frame was unusual for where it was left, though: not in the room it was stolen from, but in the chair of the security office downstairs. Even more remarkable, not a single motion detector was set off in the Blue Room. Bar investigating the possibility of ghost robbers, investigators wondered if this pointed to the plot being an inside job. \u201cAt the FBI we found that about 89% of museum institutional heists are inside jobs,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cThat\u2019s how these things get stolen.\u201d How It Really Happened\u2019s \u201cGardner Art Heist: Stealing Beauty\u201d premieres on CNN Sunday 19 May, at 9pm ET/PT.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/style/isabella-gardner-heist-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system", "text": "A pair of recent ransomware attacks crippled computer systems at two major American health care firms, disrupting patient care and exposing fundamental weaknesses in the US health care system\u2019s defenses against hackers. In both cases, federal officials and private cyber experts scrambled to try to limit the damage and get computers back online. But the cascading effects from the hacks, with ambulances diverted from hospitals and pharmacies unable to process insurance, has underscored for some US lawmakers, senior Biden administration officials and policy experts that the health care system is ill-prepared for the ripple effects of a cyberattack and needs new security regulations. Health care lags other industries such as big financial institutions and energy providers when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, told CNN that \u201cevery new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the health care sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine.\u201d Without action, the senator said, \u201cpatients\u2019 access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.\u201d In 2023, 46 hospital systems in the US, comprising 141 hospitals, were impacted by ransomware,\u00a0according\u00a0to a tally from cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.\u00a0That\u2019s up from 25 hospital systems hit by ransomware in 2022, according to the firm. The two ransomware attacks hit different nerves of the health care system. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue, snarled service at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0may have compromised\u00a0the personal data of a third of Americans. In early May, cybercriminals used a different type of ransomware in an attack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals and 40 senior living facilities in 19 states. The hack\u00a0forced\u00a0the health network to divert ambulances from some hospitals. The Biden administration is preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals, senior White House cyber official Anne Neuberger confirmed this month. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would effectively re-victimize victims of cyberattacks by imposing penalties after they are hacked. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services previously said\u00a0they are willing to use a number of measures,\u00a0including\u00a0imposing\u00a0monetary fines, to both force and encourage health care organizations to better secure their systems. Momentum is also growing on Capitol Hill to force health care organizations to meet basic cybersecurity standards. A bill\u00a0introduced\u00a0in March by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, would allow \u201cadvanced and accelerated\u201d Medicare payments to be sent to hacked health care providers as long as those providers and their contractors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. An unhealthy situation The ransomware attacks on Change Healthcare and Ascension have spotlighted the health sector\u2019s cybersecurity weakness like no other events before it, experts told CNN. And even if there are new regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, the sector \u201cwill continue to struggle from such attacks if the business of providing\u00a0healthcare remains financially fraught [and forces] leaders to prioritize only revenue generating investments,\u201d Carter Groome, chief executive of cybersecurity firm First Health Advisory, told CNN. The Change Healthcare ransomware attack, in particular, has brought fresh attention from policymakers and experts on what many see as the over-consolidation of the US health care industry. If hackers can defeat security measures at one company, millions of patients who rely on that health network can be affected. \u201cUS healthcare is in a death spiral,\u201d said Corman, who co-founded I am the Cavalry, a volunteer group that focuses on cybersecurity for resource-poor organizations in the health sector, among others. \u201cDistressed hospitals get acquired into too-big-to-fail conglomerates. Ransoms cause distress for the little ones, and multi-week, multi-state outages for the ones \u2018saved\u2019 by the big ones.\u201d Any new cybersecurity regulations should be strong enough to force meaningful improvements in the sector\u2019s cybersecurity, Corman argued. \u2018Yes. cybersecurity is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we can clearly see\u2026 neglect is more costly.\u201d Change Healthcare\u2019s parent firm, UnitedHealth Group, owns a significant portion of the US health care market. The company, which reported $371 billion in revenue last year, handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. \u201cYour revenues are bigger than some countries\u2019 GDP,\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican,\u00a0told\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty in a Senate hearing this month.\u00a0\u201cAnd how in heaven\u2019s name did you not have the necessary redundancies so that you did not experience this attack and find yourself so vulnerable?\u201d The Justice Department has been pursuing an antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth Group, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in February. More broadly, the Justice Department last week\u00a0announced\u00a0a\u00a0task force to examine \u201chealth care monopolies and collusion\u201d that will guide the department\u2019s approach to \u201ccivil and criminal enforcement in health care markets,\u201d where warranted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_weather_south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate", "text": "At least four people are dead in Houston after hurricane-force winds and torrential rains tore a damaging path through the city Thursday \u2013 part of a lashing storm system that is bringing life-threatening flooding and power outages to parts of the South. Severe storms carved through parts of Texas Thursday before pushing into western Louisiana through Friday\u2019s early hours, prompting an overnight flash flood warning for New Orleans. As the sun rises Friday, several cities in the storm\u2019s path will begin to take stock of damage left in the storms\u2019 wake. One person was killed in Houston when a crane was toppled by strong winds and two other deaths were caused by fallen trees, according to Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a, citing preliminary information. Violent storms in Houston blew out skyscraper windows, partially collapsed a nightclub and ripped a strip of roofing off the downtown Hyatt Regency, showering the hotel lobby with rain and debris, according to witness video. All non-essential workers are urged to stay home tomorrow and city schools are closed as widespread power outages have darkened the city and disabled traffic lights, Mayor John Whitmire said. Streets are littered with debris, downed trees and power lines, and the downtown area is dusted with glass from broken windows, he added. Major flooding has prompted water rescues in at least one Texas city. As many as 20 drivers had to be helped from rising water in Bryan, about 100 miles northwest of Houston, police said. Power outages left more than 900,000 homes and businesses in the dark across Texas as of Thursday night. More than 200,000 are also without power in Louisiana as storms batter the state. Possible tornadoes posed a risk in Texas and Louisiana, and carried the threat of destructive winds and golf ball-sized hail. A reported tornado in Convent, Louisiana, downed trees and power poles late Thursday, the Storm Prediction Center said. Parts of Texas and western Louisiana are under a rare Level 4 of 4 high risk of excessive rainfall Thursday, the Weather Prediction Center said. More than 600,\ufeff000 people live in the high-risk zone. High risk days like this only happen on 4% of days each year, but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the United States, according to the WPC. Just three other days have reached this concerning mark this year, including the most recent one nearly three weeks ago. It\u2019s a sign the atmosphere is primed to unload extreme amounts of rain, a phenomenon that is becoming more frequent in a warming world driven by human-caused climate change. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. It\u2019s not out of the question that one or two spots could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours. Texas and Louisiana have been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of torrential, flooding downpours since the start of April. Rainfall in the waterlogged area over the last two weeks is over 600% of what\u2019s typical, according to the WPC. Double-digit rainfall totals between 20 and 30 inches over the region in recent weeks have soaked the ground and left rivers swollen, priming the flood threat to extreme levels. Drenched soils are not expected to soak up any of Thursday\u2019s rainfall, the WPC warned Thursday morning. Widespread flash flooding could begin minutes after heavy rain starts to fall. Flooding ramps up Thursday and threat persists Friday Storms, some severe, rumbled to life Thursday afternoon in parts of Texas and prompted flash flood warnings for multiple cities, including Waco. Powerful, heavy storms will push south and east and reach Louisiana and Mississippi late in the day. More than 800,000 outages have been reported in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to PowerOutage.us. Harris County is the third-most populous in the United States. A tornado warning had been issued earlier Thursday evening in Harris County, including downtown Houston, according to the National Weather Service. The weather service also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Houston with the highest-level \u201cdestructive\u201d tag. At around 6:30 p.m., the weather service in Houston noted a \u201cdestructive storm\u201d with wind gusts of up to 80 mph was over the metro area, and urged residents to take cover immediately in a post on X. Winds in the city were reported as high as 71 mph, according to the weather service.\u00a0On the east side of the city, there were reports of winds up to 78 mph \u2013 equivalent to the strength of a Category 1 hurricane. Multiple steel power transmission towers in Houston have been mangled by the storms, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Along part of US Route 290, traffic was stopped as firefighters cleared downed lines draped over the roadway. Houston Mayor John Whitmire advised residents to stay off the roads. \u201cThe mayor and first responders are asking Houstonians to stay off the roads and avoid all unnecessary travel. Many roads are impassible due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. \u201cThere are significant power outages and reports of damage across the city. We are working with Centerpoint, METRO and other regional partners to keep everyone safe.\u201d Rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour are possible in the heaviest storms, which could lead to life-threatening flash flooding, according to the WPC. Damaging winds, hail and a couple of tornadoes are also possible. The greatest flooding danger will come as storms train later Thursday. Training storms track through and deluge the same areas over and over, like a train pulling its cars over the same stretch of track. Serious flash flooding is likely in any areas caught under multiple storms unloading 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour. Roadways may quickly become rivers and small streams could easily overflow their banks. More than 35 million people in the South are under a Level 2 of 4 or Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Thursday. Many areas may only endure one torrential storm, but even brief downpours will be enough to cause flooding problems given how wet the South has been recently. Drenching storms from Thursday night will last into Friday for parts of the Gulf Coast. An initial round of flash flooding is likely in the first half of Friday before rain starts to taper off in the afternoon. Another bout of heavy rain will develop Friday night and continue into the earliest hours of Saturday morning, working over the same areas hit earlier in the day. These storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Extremely wet start to the year The rain will only add to already extreme rainfall totals in what\u2019s been one of the wettest years to date on record across the Gulf Coast. Some Southeast cities have recorded more than half a foot of rain above what\u2019s typical for the first several months of the year. Several dozen cities from Texas to western Georgia are pacing at a top 5 wettest year to date and at least two cities in eastern Texas are experiencing their wettest year, according to the\u00a0Southeast Regional Climate Center. Dallas is experiencing its third-wettest year to date while Shreveport, Louisiana, is amid its second wettest. Excessive rainfall has largely eliminated dryness and drought conditions along the Gulf Coast, but it hasn\u2019t come without a cost. Earlier this month, nearly 2 feet of rain fell in just five days and sent parts of eastern Texas underwater. Hundreds of people and animals were rescued from flooding as some area\u00a0rivers rose to levels\u00a0not reached since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/weather/south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_middleeast_dubai-worlds-biggest-waste-to-energy-facility", "text": "It\u2019s difficult to imagine that an empty cereal box, a banana peel, or a deflated football could contribute to powering your home. Yet in Dubai, nearly half of all discarded waste plays a role in household energy. Much of it ends up at a plant operated by the Warsan Waste Management Company. \u201cAround 45% percent of Dubai\u2019s total waste comes to this facility,\u201d says Tim Clarke, the company\u2019s CEO. Operational since March of this year, the Warsan plant will use 2 million metric tons of trash annually to produce electricity, enough to power approximately 135,000 homes, according to the company. It\u2019s known as a waste-to-energy plant, and about 13% of all urban waste worldwide ends up in a facility of this kind, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. This method of processing trash is widely adopted across Europe and in nations such as Japan, China, and the US. Yet the plant in Dubai distinguishes itself through its scale. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest facility of its kind in the world,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cWe operate at around 34% efficiency of producing electricity, which is much higher than would normally be expected from an energy waste plant, and that\u2019s partly because with this size we can operate at higher temperatures and higher pressures.\u201d The power of waste The process of converting waste into energy involves three steps: burning trash, using the heat to create steam, and directing the steam to drive a turbine, which generates electricity. The process has been used for more than 100 years, but modern facilities have far more control over the pollutants released as waste is incinerated. Flue gas treatment allows the plant to filter toxic substances and stop them from going into the air. \u201cWe inject reagents into [a reactor] to strip out all the harmful elements such as heavy metals, sulfur components, and they trap particles which are then taken away for disposal,\u201d explains the CEO. Not all pollutants are filtered out. Climate-warming carbon dioxide, for example, is released into the air. However, since the plant produces power, replacing the burning of fossil fuels, Warsan Waste Management believes the overall result is positive. \u201cWe emit CO2, but also we generate 200 megawatts of electricity that\u2019s not having to be produced by a fossil fuel source, which is primarily gas in the UAE,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cSo [we\u2019re] saving around 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.\u201d Facilities such as the one in Dubai also implement a few extra steps to maximize resource extraction. Metals, for instance, are separated for recycling. The mountains of ash, resulting from burning the trash, are collected and repurposed in road construction. According to Clarke, out of the 5,500 tons of waste that the facility receives per day, only 200 tons of residue that can\u2019t be reused remain after processing. Need for recycling Waste-to-Energy plants serve as an alternative to landfills, which contribute to approximately 11% of global methane emissions. \u201cIf we\u2019re globally putting more waste into open dumps, we\u2019re creating methane that is unmanaged. That methane then is creating a significant emissions challenge,\u201d explains Bryan Staley, CEO of the US-based non-profit Environmental Research and Education Foundation. \u201cAs a solution, waste-to-energy can create less emissions compared to a landfill setting,\u201d he adds. But some environmental groups, such as Zero Waste Europe, argue that burning waste to generate electricity discourages efforts to cut waste and initiatives to increase recycling. According to a document released by the government last year, the UAE recycles 20% of its treated waste, but hopes to increase that to 90% by 2050. Staley reinforces the need for recycling, as the most energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solution for waste management. \u201cThere can be this perception of, well, I\u2019ll just throw it in the trash can and it\u2019ll be taken care of,\u201d says Staley. \u201cBut your paper, your plastics, have a much better endpoint if they\u2019re recycled and recovered rather than going to a waste energy facility because you can turn those materials into products.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/middleeast/dubai-worlds-biggest-waste-to-energy-facility/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_ebrahim-raisi-dies-succession-what-is-next-explainer-mime-intl", "text": "Once seen as a likely successor to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, President Ebrahim Raisi has died in office, leaving the Islamic Republic\u2019s hardline establishment facing an uncertain future. An ultraconservative president, 63-year-old Raisi was killed Sunday, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other high-ranking officials, in a helicopter crash in Iran\u2019s remote northwest. Their death comes at a delicate time for a country that faces unprecedented challenges at home and from abroad. The Islamic Republic\u2019s economy remains crippled by American sanctions, its young population is becoming growingly restive, and the country faces increasingly belligerent adversaries in the Middle East and beyond. Raisi\u2019s death will \u201ctrigger elections at a time when the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) is at the nadir of its legitimacy and zenith of its exclusionary policies,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said on X. Here\u2019s what comes next. Who steps in as president? Power has now been transferred to Mohammad Mokhber, who had served as Raisi\u2019s vice president and was on Monday approved as acting president by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic. Not as well known as Raisi, Mokhber is \u201canother administrator,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201cHe is close to the IRGC, close to the levers of power,\u201d Vakil said, adding that he is likely to present a model of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the coming days. But the country must, by law, hold elections within the next 50 days. On Monday, Iranian state news IRNA said Iran\u2019s presidential\u00a0elections will take place Friday, June 28. Candidates can register from May 30 to June 3, and campaigning will run from June 12 until the morning of June 27, it added. Experts say that the elections are likely to be hastily organized, with poor voter participation. In March, Iran recorded its lowest electoral turnout since the Islamic Republic\u2019s founding in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot. That vote \u2014 for seats in the parliament, or Majles, and the 88-member Assembly of Experts, which is tasked with picking the Supreme Leader \u2014 brought in mostly hardline politicians. \u201cThe population has by and large lost faith in the idea that change can come through the ballot box,\u201d Trita Parsi, co-founder and Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC, wrote Sunday on X. The March election also barred more moderate politicians from running \u2014 including former President Hassan Rouhani, once a regime stalwart \u2014 tightening the small circle of hardliners to continue the Supreme Leader\u2019s conservative rule after he dies. \u201cReal alternatives to Iran\u2019s hardliners have simply not been allowed to stand for office in the last few elections,\u201d Parsi said on X, adding that \u201cthose alternatives have in the eyes of the majority of the population lost credibility anyways, due to the failure to deliver change.\u201d Until the Supreme Leader is replaced, however, little change is expected to follow Raisi\u2019s death, particularly on foreign policy. \u201cIt is really the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary Guards who make the final decisions, and even in the region mostly implement Iran\u2019s regional policy,\u201d Vaez said, adding that \u201coverall we will see more continuity than change.\u201d What are the longer-term implications of Raisi\u2019s death? Raisi\u2019s death has raised questions about who will eventually succeed Iran\u2019s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most powerful man in the country. The Iranian clerical establishment had invested heavily in Raisi during his presidency, seeing him as a potential successor to Khamenei. Observers say he had been groomed to be elevated to the Supreme Leader\u2019s position. Raisi\u2019s death will create \u201ca succession crisis in Iran,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on X. The late president upheld some of the regime\u2019s most hardline policies, quashing the 2022 mass protests that sought to challenge repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab. According to the constitution, the 88-member Assembly of Experts picks the successor to the Supreme Leader after his death. Members of the Assembly itself are, however, pre-vetted by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body charged with overseeing elections and legislation. The Assembly of Experts has become increasingly hardline over the years. In the March vote, Raisi was re-elected to the assembly, and the Guardian Council barred Rouhani from contesting a seat. While there are procedures to selecting the Supreme Leader, discussions about successions are always \u201cvery opaque,\u201d Vakil said, adding that they take place \u201cwithin a very close circle of individuals.\u201d Some have pointed to the incumbent Supreme Leader\u2019s son Mojtaba Khamenei, a midlevel cleric, as a potential contender for the top post, but that would be a shift from the principles of the Islamic Republic, which overthrew a repressive monarchy in 1970 and has prided itself for shaking off hereditary rule. Allowing Mojtaba to replace his father may, however, spur theories that Raisi\u2019s death was not accidental, Sadjadpour said. Raisi\u2019s rivals are also likely to try to fill the vacuum he leaves, Vaez said. \u201c(This) definitely throws all the plans that offices of the Supreme Leader probably had out the window,\u201d Vaez told CNN\u2019s Paula Newton. He added, however, that Iran has no shortage of political actors who are \u201csubservient and belong to the old guard of the Islamic Republic\u201d who can replace Raisi. How will it impact Iran\u2019s foreign relations? Raisi and Amir-Abdollahian oversaw a turnaround in Iran\u2019s relations with its Arab neighbors, helping normalized relations with longtime foe Saudi Arabia,\u00a0with China\u2019s assistance. But they also saw the Islamic Republic initiate a large-scale direct attack on Israel for the first time,\u00a0after a suspected Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria. That prompted Israel to launch an unprecedented retaliation, bringing the shadow war between the two nations out into the open. Experts say that Raisi\u2019s death is unlikely to have an impact on the regime\u2019s foreign policy, which is almost exclusively the domain of the Supreme Leader. Iran\u2019s foreign policy is decided by the Supreme National Security Council and can be vetoed by the Supreme Leader, Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran expert and editor of the Amwaj.media news outlet, told CNN\u2019s Anderson. \u201cWe will see continuity in terms of how Iran approaches the regional files, collaboration with regional allies.\u201d He added that a similar trajectory is likely to be seen on the nuclear program. Could the upcoming presidential election bring change to Iran? Some experts say that the election presents an opportunity for the regime to bring back sidelined moderates. While Khamenei is likely to maintain conservative rule, he \u201chas always emphasized voter turnout as a litmus test of the legitimacy of the system,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cThat election can be a watershed moment for Iran.\u201d Raisi came to power in elections that many Iranians saw as a foregone conclusion. With moderate candidates squeezed out, voter turnout was extremely low,\u00a0highlighting the regime\u2019s waning legitimacy. \u201cIf the Supreme Leader chooses to use these early elections as a watershed moment to open up the political space, to get people to vote again, that could be a massive gamechanger,\u201d Shabani said, adding that this would also impact succession to the Supreme Leader. What are the funeral plans? Multi-day funeral ceremonies for Raisi will begin on Tuesday in Tabriz and continue in Qom, Tehran and Mashhad, according to Mohsen Mansouri, the head of the funeral planning committee and and Iran\u2019s vice president of executive affairs. Speaking to\u00a0state television\u00a0on Monday, Mansouri said funeral prayers will begin in the northwestern city of Tabriz at 9:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday. There will be a procession from the Tabriz Martyr\u2019s Square to the Tabriz Mosallah (prayer hall). Later on Tuesday, the bodies of the victims of the helicopter crash will be transferred to the holy Shiite city of Qom, where funeral prayers will take place at 4:30 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) outside the Fatima Masumeh Shrine. Afterwards, on Tuesday evening, the bodies will be transferred to Tehran\u2019s Grand Mosallah Mosque, according to Mansouri. On Wednesday, large ceremonies are planned in Tehran at the Grand Mosallah. One or two other ceremonies will be announced later, according to Mansouri. On Thursday morning, funeral prayers will begin in Birjand, South Khorasan province, where Raisi served as the Supreme Leader\u2019s representative. Later on Thursday, Raisi\u2019s body will be transferred to the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad where Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will conduct prayers over Raisi\u2019s body, according to Mehr news. On Thursday night, Raisi\u2019s body will be buried in Mashhad, according to Mansouri. Mansouri also announced the closure of offices on Wednesday all over the country, and said the governors in the provinces where processions will take place can declare public holidays on Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/middleeast/ebrahim-raisi-dies-succession-what-is-next-explainer-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_netanyahu-sinwar-icc-arrest-warrants-explainer-intl", "text": "The prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) is seeking arrest warrants for top Hamas and Israeli figures on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. If approved by a panel of judges, the arrest warrants would be issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Warrants are also being sought for three top Hamas officials: Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, political chief Ismail Haniyah, and Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, who is better known as Mohammed Deif. Here\u2019s what we know about the ICC cases and what they mean for Israel and Hamas. How would an arrest warrant affect Netanyahu or Hamas leaders? The decision to seek arrest warrants doesn\u2019t immediately mean the individual is guilty, but is the first stage in a process that could lead to a lengthy trial. If the court finds sufficient evidence of crimes, it can summon the suspect to appear voluntarily. The court can also issue an arrest warrant, relying on member countries to make the arrest and transfer the suspect to the ICC. If the suspect appears before the court, a pre-trial takes place in which the court decides if there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial. Then there is a trial before three ICC judges, in which the prosecution must prove \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the individual is guilty of the crimes. Once a verdict passes, the charged individual may be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison. Under exceptional circumstances, a life sentence can also be given, the court says. The ICC has so far issued arrest warrants against 42 people, 21 of whom have been detained with the help of member states. \u201cThe immediate problem for Israeli officials under any ICC arrest warrant would be that the court\u2019s 124 member states would be under a legal obligation to arrest such officials if they traveled to any of those 124 countries,\u201d Chile Eboe-Osuji, a former ICC president, wrote this month in Foreign Policy magazine. \u201cThat obligation should not be underestimated,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cjust last year, Putin canceled his plans to attend the BRICS summit in South Africa, in the apparent light of Pretoria\u2019s obligation to arrest him.\u201d Of Hamas leaders for whom arrest warrants are sought, two \u2013 Sinwar and Deif \u2013 are believed to be in Gaza, while Haniyah resides in Qatar, which is not a signatory to the Rome Statute. What is the ICC and who can it indict? Headquartered at The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC was established in 2002 and is tasked with prosecuting individuals for crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Unlike the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the ICC is not an organ of the United Nations and does not prosecute states. While the ICC is independent of the UN, it is endorsed by the UN\u2019s General Assembly and maintains a cooperation agreement with the UN. When a case is not within the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction, the UN Security Council can refer that case to the ICC, granting it jurisdiction. The court can investigate alleged crimes committed on the territory, or by a national, of any state that has accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction by signing the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC. Any member state can ask the ICC\u2019s prosecutor to launch an investigation. The court has previously issued arrest warrants against high-ranking individuals, including former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, Saif Gadhafi, the son of the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and most recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin. Signatory states\u00a0are obliged\u00a0to apprehend those facing arrest warrants, but leaders have often sought to evade those warrants, restricting their freedom of movement. The ICC does not have its own enforcement mechanism and has relied on countries\u2019 support for arrests. Does the ICC have jurisdiction over Israeli nationals? Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were referred to the ICC by five countries \u2013 South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti \u2013 in November, calling on the court to investigate the possible crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, among others, in the Palestinian territories, and asked it to determine whether \u201cone or more specific persons should be charged.\u201d Israel does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC as it hasn\u2019t signed the Rome Statute. But that doesn\u2019t mean its citizens cannot be prosecuted by the court. The court had already been investigating possible crimes committed by Israel since 2014 in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. The investigation began in March 2021, and was referred to the court by the Palestinian Authority, which adopted the ICC\u2019s mandate in 2015 as the State of Palestine. The ICC concluded then that it has jurisdiction on the conflict and, \u201cby majority, that the territorial scope of this jurisdiction extends to Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\u201d That investigation, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said, \u201cis ongoing and extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence since the attacks that took place on 7 October 2023.\u201d Remarks by Netanyahu this month pointed to anxiety about the ICC probe. Issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials would leave an \u201cindelible stain\u201d on the edifice of international law and justice, Netanyahu said, adding that the ICC was \u201cfounded as a consequence of the Holocaust\u201d and should not attempt to \u201cundermine\u201d Israel\u2019s fundamental right to self-defense. The ICC action comes as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a different court in The Hague, considers a case brought by South Africa in which Israel is accused of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\u00a0Israel recognizes the ICJ. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, prompted by the October 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 others hostage, has dragged on for nearly eight months. More than 35,000 people have been killed during Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities. Swathes of the territory have been reduced to rubble and more than half of its population of 2.3 million has been internally displaced. Famine has set in in parts of the strip. Does the ICC have jurisdiction over Hamas? Palestinian leaders signed up to the Rome Statute in 2015. As such, the ICC has jurisdiction over actors in Gaza and other Palestinian territories and by extension, over actors in those territories, including Hamas. ICC prosecutor Khan confirmed this in October, saying alleged crimes committed by Israel in Gaza, or by Hamas in Israel, fall under the court\u2019s jurisdiction, Reuters reported. This means the court can indict Hamas leaders over possible crimes committed against both Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Shelly Aviv Yeini, head of the international law department at the Israeli Hostage and Missing Families Forum, said the ICC could make Hamas accountable for crimes even if the state of Israel does not recognize the authority of the court. \u201cWe are an NGO, a private entity,\u201d Yeini told CNN earlier, as the families of hostages held by Gaza gathered to submit a complaint against Hamas to the ICC. \u201cWe can bring about a claim in the name of the hostages even if the state (Israel) doesn\u2019t recognize its (the ICC\u2019s) jurisdiction.\u201d ICC prosecutor Khan said Monday he is seeking the warrants \u201con the basis of evidence collected and examined by my office,\u201d and thanked families of the hostages \u201cfor their courage in coming forward to provide their accounts.\u201d According to Article 15 of the ICC Rome Statue, any individual, group, or organization can file complaints of potential crimes to the court. A member of the Hamas political bureau, Muhammad Nazzal, told CNN in February that going to the ICC was \u201ca mistake\u201d that would stall negotiations to return the hostages. \u201cThe shortest way to return their prisoners is to complete the ongoing negotiating process,\u201d the Hamas member told CNN at the time. How have Hamas, Israel and others reacted to the ICC\u2019s action? Both Hamas and Israeli politicians denounced the ICC\u2019s move. Hamas said it was an attempt to \u201cequate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against a number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis.\u201d The militant group said warrant requests for Netanyahu and Gallant had come \u201cseven months late,\u201d referring to the duration of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Israeli politicians across the political spectrum condemned\u00a0the\u00a0decision. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called it a \u201cscandalous decision\u201d and an \u201cunrestrained frontal attack on the victims of October 7 and our 128 hostages in Gaza.\u201d The leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, called it \u201ca complete moral failure\u201d and said Israel \u201ccannot accept the outrageous comparison between Netanyahu and Sinwar.\u201d The right-wing minister for National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir, accused the ICC of antisemitism and called for an escalation of attacks against Hamas, while Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said: \u201cWe have not seen such a show of hypocrisy and hatred of Jews as that of the Hague Tribunal since Nazi propaganda.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Prime Minister\u2019s office and Defense Ministry. In the US, meanwhile, President Joe Biden has denounced the ICC prosecutor\u2019s move, calling it \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cLet me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2014 none \u2014 between Israel and Hamas,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cWe will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US \u201cfundamentally rejects\u201d the ICC prosecutor\u2019s announcement and warned it could \u201cjeopardize\u201d efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release agreement. \u201cWe reject the prosecutor\u2019s equivalence of Israel with Hamas.\u00a0It is shameful.\u00a0Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that carried out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and is still holding dozens of innocent people hostage, including Americans,\u201d Blinken said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_slovakia-prime-minister-fico-shooting-intl", "text": "Slovakia\u2019s Prime Minister Robert Fico was rushed to hospital in critical condition on Wednesday after he was shot five times in an assassination attempt that shocked the country. The attack took place after an off-site government meeting in the central Slovak town of Handlova. The suspected gunman was among a small crowd of people waiting to greet the prime minister on the street outside the cultural center, where the meeting took place, local media reported. Footage from the scene shows the gunman approaching Fico and firing at him from close range across a security barrier. The injured prime minister is then seen being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Fico was taken to a local hospital and then transferred by helicopter to a major trauma center about 20 miles (30 kilometers) away in Banska Bystrica. No one else was injured in the attack, officials said. Both the country\u2019s Defense Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k and Interior Minister Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160utaj E\u0161tok called the shooting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d with \u0160utaj E\u0161tok saying that \u201cthe suspect made the decision to do it shortly after the presidential election.\u201d In an emotional news conference outside the hospital, the two ministers said Fico was \u201cfighting for his life\u201d after the shooting and had been, at that point, in surgery for three and half hours. Later in the evening, Slovakian deputy Prime Minister Tom\u00e1\u0161 Taraba said he believed the prime minister would survive following surgery that \u201cwent well\u201d and was \u201cnot in a life-threatening situation at this moment.\u201d \u201cI was very shocked and tried to contact people to figure out how serious his condition was,\u201d Taraba said in an interview with BBC\u2019s Newshour program on Wednesday, recalling the moment he heard about Fico\u2019s shooting. \u201cFortunately, as far as I know the operation went well and I guess in the end he will survive,\u201d he said. Taraba told the BBC that Fico \u201cwas heavily injured\u201d and a bullet \u201cwent through the stomach and the second one hit the joints.\u201d Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. The official statement posted on Fico\u2019s official Facebook said the PM was taken to Banska Bystrica instead of the capital city of Bratislava because \u201can acute intervention\u201d was necessary. Handlova is about two hours\u2019 drive from the capital Bratislava. Slovak President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 said the suspected gunman was detained by the police. She said law enforcement agencies will release more information when they can and asked the public not to spread unconfirmed rumors. \u010caputov\u00e1 condemned what she called a \u201cbrutal and reckless\u201d attack on the 59-year-old politician. Speaking at a news conference later in the afternoon, she said the shooting was \u201can attack on democracy as well.\u201d Slovakia\u2019s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. Speaking to reporters in front of the hospital where Fico is being treated, Defense Minister Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said: \u201cHate is not an answer to hate.\u201d Visibly shaken and struggling for words at multiple moments during the news conference, Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said it was \u201ctime for some people to have a hard look into the mirror.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that this was politically motivated. The inability to accept the choice of people, which some may not like \u2026 it leads to this,\u201d he said. Interior Minister \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok called for calm, saying \u201cthose who are endorsing this attack as well as those who are calling for some sort of a revenge. And I am asking you, the media too, please, use your power, your influence. Because until now, it was some of you who sow the hate,\u201d he said. Following the shooting, \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok said the country is \u201cexperiencing the worst day of its democracy.\u201d \u201cFor the first time in the 31 years of our democratic sovereign republic, someone has decided to express a political opinion not in an election but with a gun on the street,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country\u2019s direction and position in the world since Fico\u2019s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. The country has seen weeks of largely peaceful protests over his coalition government\u2019s controversial domestic reforms. The government is also trying to shut down public service broadcaster RTVS and plans to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. Felt like a \u2018nightmare\u2019 Social media footage appeared to show the moment Fico was attacked. As he approaches a crowd of people, a man is seen lunging towards Fico with what appears to be a gun pointed at him.  Five shots are heard and Fico falls to the ground. An eyewitness who was at the scene where Fico was shot said the attack felt like a \u201cnightmare\u201d after hearing three \u201cquick\u201d shots, fired one after the other as if you were to \u201cthrow a firecracker on the ground.\u201d \u201cI heard three shots, it was quick one by one like if you throw a firecracker on the ground,\u201d eyewitness\u00a0Lubica Valkova told Reuters, adding that \u201che (Fico) fell next to the barrier.\u201d \u201cI think it is a nightmare, I\u2019ll tell you I think I will not wake up from this,\u201d the 66-year-old said. \u201cThat this is not possible to happen in\u00a0Slovakia.\u201d Valkova said she had been waiting a long time to shake Fico\u2019s hand and was taking pictures of him when he walked out of the building in Handlova. \u201cAt this moment we heard something like a bang, we thought someone made a joke and threw a firecracker on the ground, that was my first reaction,\u201d Valkova recalled. The Slovak resident told Reuters she had been waiting from 10 a.m. local time. She claimed police did not search people who were waiting at the event, adding that \u201cwe could have shown our empty hands.\u201d Ally of Moscow In what was a stunning comeback for the controversial politician, Fico won a third term as Slovakian prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized western support for Ukraine. As prime minister, he made a major U-turn in Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine: Fico had pledged an immediate end to Slovak military support for Ukraine and promised to block Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions. Ahead of the election, Fico made no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and blamed \u201cUkrainian Nazis and fascists\u201d for provoking Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the\u00a0false narrative Russia\u2019s president\u00a0has used to justify his invasion. While in opposition, Fico became a close ally of Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, especially when it came to criticism of the European Union. Domestically, his coalition government is also pushing controversial reforms that have prompted weeks of large-scale peaceful protests. Attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system have been particularly controversial, as the government seeks to reduce penalties for corruption and has already abolished Slovakia\u2019s special prosecutor\u2019s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that involved people connected to Fico and his party SMER (\u201cDirection \u2013 Social Democracy\u201d). Fico previously served as Slovakia\u2019s prime minister for more than a decade, first between 2006 and 2010 and then again from 2012 to 2018. He was forced to resign in March 2018 after weeks of mass protests over the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1. Kuciak reported on corruption among the country\u2019s elite, including people directly connected to Fico and his party SMER. World leaders immediately condemned the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a telegram to Slovakia\u2019s president that \u201cthere can be no justification for this monstrous crime\u201d and wished Fico a speedy and complete recovery. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted: \u201cI strongly condemn the vile attack on Prime Minister Robert Fico. Such acts of violence have no place in our society and undermine democracy, our most precious common good.\u201d And Hungarian Prime Minister Orban added: \u201cI was deeply shocked by the heinous attack against my friend, Prime Minister Robert Fico. We pray for his health and quick recovery!\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed \u201csolidarity with the people of Slovakia\u201d following the \u201cappalling\u201d assault on Fico. US President Joe Biden said he was \u201calarmed\u201d by the attempted assassination of Fico, calling it a \u201chorrific act of violence.\u201d \u201cJill and I are praying for a swift recovery, and our thoughts are with his family and the people of Slovakia,\u201d he said in a statement. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he \u201cstrongly condemns the shocking attack.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_17_americas_dominican-republic-election-explainer-intl-latam", "text": "The Dominican Republic is days away from\u00a0a general election that will see voters elect new lawmakers and the president\u00a0as they weigh the nation\u2019s economy and security. Among those seeking the Caribbean nation\u2019s highest office\u00a0on May 19\u00a0are the current president, a former president, and a mayor. If no presidential candidate receives over 50% of the vote, a second round will be held on June 30. Here\u2019s a look at the candidates and issues: President Luis Abinader promises \u2018the change continues\u2019 The Dominican Republic\u2019s current president, Luis Abinader, is seeking re-election for a second term that would keep him in office until 2028.\u00a0The 56-year-old\u00a0economist and businessman first assumed the presidency in 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 following in the footsteps of his senator father, a three-time presidential candidate. Leading the ballot of the Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM) with his slogan \u201cThe change continues,\u201d\u00a0the popular leader\u00a0is now\u00a0promising four more years of economic growth and stability.\u00a0During his\u00a0first\u00a0term\u00a0from\u00a02020\u00a0to\u00a02024, the\u00a0Dominican Republic\u00a0established a new record\u00a0in the tourism industry,\u00a0with more than 10 million tourists visiting the island in\u00a02023. Experts now expect Abinader to focus on the priorities of his first term, expanding on development, reform, and the fight against corruption. He has promised reforms for the National Police, health sector, and education. Abinader\u2019s\u00a0government\u00a0has shown a commitment to addressing long-standing challenges\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0energy\u00a0sector.\u00a0But the World Bank says\u00a0the Dominican Republic\u00a0has more work to do\u00a0in\u00a0increasing transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the sector; continuing with the diversification of\u00a0the energy matrix among others. \u201cAbinader has a first rate and well-coordinated economic team,\u201d says economist and former\u00a0Dominican\u00a0ambassador to the US, Bernardo Vega.\u00a0But\u00a0Vega\u00a0notes that\u00a0increased\u00a0losses in the electric distribution system\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and\u00a0a resulting\u00a0increase in\u00a0external\u00a0debt\u00a0\u2013\u00a0have not\u00a0reflected well on his administration. Abinader\u2019s handling of\u00a0a spiraling\u00a0political and social crisis\u00a0in\u00a0neighboring Haiti\u00a0has also had mixed reviews.\u00a0For\u00a0voters living close to the border, the question of whether measures like deportations and closing the country\u2019s border to Haiti have been effective in insulating the Dominican Republic from shocks in Port-au-Prince will be top of mind, according to political analyst Rosario Espinal. During his\u00a02020\u00a0campaign run,\u00a0Abinader\u00a0promised to fight corruption, and later appointed what he described as\u00a0the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0\u201cfirst independent\u201d\u00a0\u00a0attorney\u00a0general. \u00a0Critics\u00a0argue that his administration\u2019s anti-corruption push\u00a0focused\u00a0disproportionately on members of the Dominican Liberation Party,\u00a0which held power for many years\u00a0before Abinader\u2019s election. Nevertheless, experts say the crackdown on corruption, along with his handling of the pandemic, are widely seen as achievements. Former President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez seeks re-election \u2013 for the fourth time A familiar face to voters will be Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez, 70, who has already held the Dominican presidency three times: from 1996 to 2000, from 2004 to 2008 and from 2008 to 2012. Fernandez is most known\u00a0modernizing the Dominican Republic\u2019s\u00a0state institutions and justice system, including the constitutional reform that led to the 2010 Constitution, according to experts. One of his major contributions was during his first term when Fernandez privatized the energy distribution sector and\u00a0sold shares to private investors in the\u00a0electricity\u00a0companies that until then\u00a0had been\u00a0owned by the government,\u00a0according to\u00a0Vega. The ex-president is also recognized\u00a0in the Dominican Republic\u00a0for\u00a0advancing and building national\u00a0infrastructure,\u00a0such as\u00a0the subway system\u00a0that\u00a0transformed the capital city of Santo Domingo.\u00a0As a result,\u00a0Fernandez\u2019s presidencies\u00a0had\u00a0a\u00a0major impact on tourism in the eastern region, experts\u00a0say. But many voters will also likely remember that government corruption ran high during\u00a0his 12 years as head of state, Vega\u00a0says. Today,\u00a0Fernandez\u00a0heads the ticket of the\u00a0Force of the People\u00a0party, which he founded in November 2019 after losing the party primaries of his former party, the Dominican Liberation Party. Recently, Fernandez has promised to push forth public policies aimed at reducing poverty, the construction of decent homes, better education, comprehensive health, and citizen security, among others. His\u00a0platform has focused on inequality in the country, with \u201ccalls for wealth redistribution and social justice,\u201d according to Americas Quarterly. The five-time presidential candidate has also reportedly said he would back a new United Nations peacekeeping mission to Haiti. Abel Mart\u00ednez: From prosecutor, deputy, mayor to trying to win the presidency Abel Mart\u00ednez, 51, is a Dominican politician, educator and lawyer with a wide-spanning career in public service. Most recently the mayor of Santiago until last month, Martinez got his start as deputy prosecutor in capital city Santo Domingo, and then as a prosecutor in Santiago in the 1990s. He later became a deputy to the country\u2019s National Congress, serving three terms from 2002 to 2016 and presiding over the Chamber of Deputies for six years. Martinez is focused on heightening tech across multiple sectors, per Americas Quarterly,\u00a0as well as strengthening\u00a0the country\u2019s prison system and surveillance at the border with Haiti. Martinez is focused on ending hunger and poverty, better education for students and teachers, and fighting\u00a0crime and citizen safety. The youngest candidate running for president\u00a0also campaigns\u00a0against illegal immigration, especially of Haitians. Crime and safety and inflation on the ballot Crime and safety are among the biggest concerns of Dominicans\u00a0in this election, according to several surveys, although government data indicates that crime has decreased in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2023, with\u00a0the\u00a0homicide\u00a0rate falling by 30.2%. Since June 2023, the US State Department\u00a0has\u00a0maintained\u00a0a\u00a0Level 2 travel advisory for\u00a0the\u00a0Dominican Republic and recommends tourists exercise increased caution\u00a0due to crime. Pablo Flores resides in Santo Domingo and has his own business, a mini market. At one point, rampant crime forced him to temporarily shutter the business, he recalls. Today, for fear of being robbed, he has taken his own precautions; a fence protects the entire perimeter of his small business. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take care of myself, who is going to take care of me? Crime must go down because it\u2019s very high,\u201d says Flores. Hand-in-hand with street crime are the Dominican Republic\u2019s economic woes. According to\u00a0the World Bank, over the last two decades, the Dominican Republic has been one of the fastest-growing economies in Caribbean. Yet the drivers of this exceptional growth\u00a0appear to be\u00a0reaching their limit due to low productivity growth in recent years, insufficient human capital to meet the needs of the business sector, climate change-related disasters, and distortions in key markets, including the inefficient allocation of tax exemptions,\u00a0according to\u00a0the World Bank. And while the\u00a0Dominican economy grew by 4.9% last year,\u00a0high inflation rates in\u00a0both\u00a02022\u00a0(8.8%)\u00a0and 2023 (4.8%)\u00a0have taken a toll on the population\u2019s quality of life. Yoely Escarlante, a mechanic, says he is struggling to support his four children, and keeps his small workshop in Santo Domingo open rain or shine. There are days when he can earn up to $100 (between 5,000 and 6,000 Dominican pesos) in a day, according to his calculations. But some days, he doesn\u2019t earn a dime, he says. The economic situation is also of great concern for Ney Segura, a public transportation driver. \u201cThe money just doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0says. In his view, \u201cthe poor are poorer.\u201d More than 40% of Dominicans are economically vulnerable and are at risk of falling into poverty due to climate-related impacts and economic crises, according to the World Bank. Likewise, gender gaps in jobs and wages, shorter working lives, and higher unemployment and unpaid roles contribute to increased poverty among women in particular, it says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/americas/dominican-republic-election-explainer-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_americas_chiapas-mexico-killings-campaign-event", "text": "A mayoral candidate was among the six people killed by gunfire at a political campaign event in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas on Thursday, according to the Institute of Elections and Citizen Participation (IEPC). Lucero L\u00f3pez Maza, the mayoral candidate for the municipality of La Concordia, was killed in the attack, which, according to preliminary investigations, was a confrontation between armed civilians. Two other people were injured, the Attorney General\u2019s Office of Chiapas said. This comes as political violence has spiked across the country as Mexico heads toward its largest election in history on June 2. The Attorney General\u2019s Office said three of the victims, one of whom was a minor, were women, and three men. All died from gunshot wounds. The investigation is ongoing as police search for the identities and whereabouts of the perpetrators. IEPC condemned the attack, saying, \u201cthat events of this nature generate fear and uncertainty among citizens\u201d and risked discouraging people from participating in the upcoming election. Since the electoral process officially began in September 2023, an average of at least two people a day have suffered some type of political violence, according to private consulting firm Integralia. The official government figures are lower. Violence has been on the rise in the southern state, which borders Guatemala, as cartels fight for control of lucrative routes for migrant and drug smuggling routes. Earlier this week, eleven people were killed in mass shootings in the neighboring municipality of Chicomuselo, the state prosecutor said. The Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel have been engaged in a turf war in the area, with hundreds forced to flee their homes in January. Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador acknowledged that the region has been dealing with violent clashes recently, but claimed that the problem was being sensationalized. \u201cIt is very unfortunate but there is\u00a0a lot of profit made from murders and human pain.

{"id": "2024_05_18_asia_tsai-taiwan-map-china-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Tsai Ing-wen never set out to be a leader. Growing up shy, she aspired to become an archeologist, because \u201cpeople that are dead already wouldn\u2019t jump up and argue with you.\u201d But instead of picking over the remains of history, the self-described introvert ended up charting a new course for Taiwan in some of the world\u2019s choppiest geopolitical waters. \u201cAt this very moment, Taiwan faces a difficult situation,\u201d Tsai said in her inauguration speech when she became the island\u2019s first female president in 2016.\u00a0She was handed a flatlining economy, a lagging military and a groundswell of discontent over her predecessor\u2019s push to forge closer ties with neighboring China, an authoritarian giant that has vowed to one day absorb the self-ruled democracy. Eight years on, as the 67-year-old prepares to step down after two terms in office, she leaves the island of 23 million people with an elevated international profile, a firmer partnership with the United States, ongoing defense reforms and a consolidated sense of its distinct Taiwanese identity. It is also left with the looming threat of invasion by China, which has grown more assertive and belligerent under strongman leader Xi Jinping. Xi has ramped up pressure on Taiwan and vowed to never renounce the use of force to bring it under control. While supporters applaud Tsai for standing up to China, defending Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, freedom and democracy, critics blame her for straining ties with Beijing, stoking cross-strait tensions. Under Tsai, Taiwan, which has its own past of brutal authoritarian rule and repression of minorities, has championed LGBTQ rights and become a bastion of democracy and liberal values in Asia, offering a stark contrast to Xi\u2019s authoritarian, socially conservative and patriarchal vision for China. Domestically, there have been mounting public grievances over livelihood issues, especially Taiwan\u2019s stubbornly low wages and unaffordable housing. But according to multiple polls, Tsai is leaving office with a net-positive approval rating \u2013 unprecedented among Taiwan\u2019s outgoing leaders in the democratic era. On Monday, Tsai will hand the baton to her former premier and vice president Lai Ching-te, who will be sworn in as Taiwan\u2019s new president after winning the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) an unprecedented third term in January. Days before the election, Tsai summed up the island\u2019s transformation over the past eight years in her last New Year\u2019s address as president. \u201cWhat has changed is that Taiwan is no longer overlooked,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone were to ask me what my legacy for Taiwan is, I would say that I am leaving behind a Taiwan of the world.\u201d An unconventional politician Tsai is an unconventional politician in Taiwan. Reserved by nature, she cut a quiet figure in a boisterous democracy known for its festival-like rallies and emotional political speeches. She never married or had children and is an animal lover whose beloved pets frequently featured on her social media accounts, something that endeared her to many young people. She used to be so shy that she would lower her head to avoid meeting people\u2019s eyes when walking down the street, Wellington Koo, her national security advisor, said in Taiwan in Transition, a documentary on Tsai\u2019s presidency. In another documentary, Invisible Nation, Tsai admitted she never dreamed of becoming a president and dreaded talking to people when she was young. \u201cI wanted a quiet life. I thought I would become a historian or an archeologist to study things that happened in the past, (because) people that are dead already wouldn\u2019t jump up and argue with you,\u201d she said. But she ended up studying law and becoming a professor, before working as a trade negotiator for Taiwan and a government minister responsible for China policy. Years working as a non-partisan technocrat imbued her with a \u201cmodest, quiet and calm\u201d style of leadership, according to Invisible Nation\u2019s director Vanessa Hope. Tsai entered politics at 48 years old, when she joined the ruling DPP in 2004. Four years later, the political latecomer faced little competition to become DPP\u2019s chairperson as the party reeled from a crushing presidential election defeat. She first ran for president in 2012, but lost to incumbent Ma Ying-jeou from the Kuomintang (KMT). She succeeded at the second try, making history not only as Taiwan\u2019s first woman president, but also one of the first women in Asia elected to top office without hailing from a political dynasty. \u201cPeople always think that I\u2019m a very cold person,\u201d Tsai said in Invisible Nation. \u201cBut the day I was elected president, that was the most emotional moment in my life.\u201d \u2018Put Taiwan on the map\u2019 Since Tsai took office, Taiwan has been caught in an intensifying battle for dominance between China and the US, a global pandemic and the geopolitical and economic fallouts from raging wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Through it all, the island has boosted its international standing and recognition, bolstering its role as a key democratic partner and an indispensable link in the global microchip supply chain. In 2019, Taiwan became the first Asian jurisdiction to legalize same-sex marriage. In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, it won international praise for its exemplary response and efforts to help other countries, despite its exclusion from the World Health Organization (WHO). Taipei has also enjoyed a surge of international backing from like-minded partners, including the US, Japan and the Czech Republic. \u201cShe\u2019ll be known as the one who put Taiwan on the map internationally,\u201d said Wen-ti Sung, a Taipei-based fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub. During China\u2019s rapid rise to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy and a major power, Taiwan had at times found itself something of an afterthought.\u00a0Now, the island\u2019s strategic importance \u2013 it is the world\u2019s largest producer of advanced semiconductors \u2013 has thrust it to the center of geopolitical calculations, with peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait becoming a matter of global concern. Amid hardening global fault lines, Tsai worked to strengthen ties with the US during both the Trump and Biden administrations. The two sides bolstered economic cooperation, reciprocated high-level political visits and expanded US arms sales to Taiwan. Support for Taiwan has become one of the few issues of bipartisan consensus ahead of the US presidential elections. \u201cWe have seen a normative shift in the way that Western governments talk about Taiwan, in ways that legitimize its sovereignty,\u201d said Amanda Hsiao, senior China analyst for the International Crisis Group. \u201cUS-China competition and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine were also factors that accelerated this trend. But she took advantage of the geopolitical winds.\u201d Despite tightening ties with its most important security guarantor, the island\u00a0lost 10 diplomatic allies to Beijing during Tsai\u2019s tenure. It has also been excluded from the WHO\u2019s annual assembly since 2016, losing its previous observer status since Tsai took office. Standing up to China Poaching Taiwan\u2019s dwindling number of diplomatic allies and blocking it from attending the World Health Assembly as an observer is widely seen as part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to pressure Tsai into toeing its political line. Unlike the opposition KMT, Tsai and the DPP have refused to endorse the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d that both Taiwan and the mainland belong to \u201cone China,\u201d but with different interpretations of what that means. Beijing, which deems the tacit agreement a precondition for dialogue, has cut official contact with Taipei since Tsai took office. In addition to the diplomatic squeeze, Xi has ramped up economic and military coercion, slapping tariffs on Taiwanese imports and routinely sending warplanes close to the island. Tensions came to a head in August 2022, when China fired missiles into waters around Taiwan and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. But Tsai also maintained a deliberately cautious stance, avoiding provoking Beijing with endorsement of Taiwan\u2019s formal independence, something many in her party openly favor and advocate for. Instead, she argued that Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, is already \u201can independent country\u201d and therefore has no need to declare independence. Analysts say Tsai moved the DPP\u2019s position on cross-strait relations closer to the center of politics in Taiwan, from a more fiercely pro-independence stance. Polls show growing numbers of Taiwanese \u2013 especially young people \u2013 view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of China. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and only 3% identify primarily as Chinese \u2013 while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese. But Huang Kwei-bo, professor of diplomacy at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University, criticized Tsai\u2019s pivot toward the US at the expense of ties with China. \u201cTaiwan needs to work closely with the US\u2026but it would be unwise of Taiwan to lose political communication channels with Beijing,\u201d he said, noting\u00a0that Taiwan can\u2019t simply rely on deterrence or military operations to defend itself. \u201cMaintaining political relations with Beijing is another necessary approach to better security for Taiwan,\u201d he added. Defense reforms Weeks after Tsai was sworn in, she attended a graduation ceremony at Taiwan\u2019s Military Academy and delivered a stern message: \u201cOur armed forces need to be reformed in a big, bold way\u2026We also need to reform our national defense systems and culture.\u201d Since then, she has often shown up at military events, sometimes donning bulletproof vests and helmets among soldiers \u2013 challenging prejudices that question women\u2019s ability to command the military. Over her tenure, Tsai has boosted military spending, extended mandatory military service from four months to a year and accelerated the development of its indigenous weapons program to boost combat readiness, including the island\u2019s first domestically produced submarine. These developments \u201cgive confidence to Taiwan\u2019s security partners in terms of the island\u2019s determination for its own fair share for providing its own security,\u201d Sung said. Taipei has also been talking with Washington to establish a \u201ccontingency stockpile\u201d of munitions on Taiwanese soil. The US is bound by law to supply Taiwan with weapons to defend itself, and for decades the Taiwanese military has been purchasing fighter jets and missiles from Washington. But under Tsai, Taiwan has sought to enhance its asymmetric defense capabilities, developing and procuring cheaper and more mobile weapon systems that could be instrumental in halting a potential Chinese invasion. Taiwanese military experts have increasingly advocated for such an approach, noting that Taiwan can never match China in military might and assets. Despite the increases, Taiwan\u2019s defense budget is still dwarfed by that of China, accounting for less than 10% of Beijing\u2019s military spending. But Taiwan can still make itself an enormously costly place for China to try and overrun without having to match its far larger, wealthier neighbor. The war in Ukraine has shown Taiwan the effectiveness of portable missiles and drones on the battlefield in fending off a more powerful enemy, experts say. \u201cThe international environment shifted and that contributed to this awareness in Taiwan of how close war could be,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cTsai opened the door to defense reform and the idea that defending Taiwan requires a whole-of-society effort.\u201d Domestic challenges Tsai has also left a mixed domestic legacy. Her push to legalize same-sex marriage angered conservatives, especially in rural regions, but made Taiwan the envy of LGBTQ communities across Asia. This week, days before stepping down as president, Tsai invited Taiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind to perform the first ever drag show at the presidential office, following her win on hit TV series \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d last month. Tsai has also sought to revitalize economic growth and address social inequality, nurturing emerging industries such as renewable energy and launching pension reforms. During her tenure, Taiwan\u2019s economy grew at an average rate of over 3%, but many residents say the economic benefits are little felt in their everyday lives. Instead, Tsai\u2019s administration has faced mounting discontent over stagnant wages, skyrocketing housing prices and cost of living. She has also been criticized for sluggish judicial reforms, failure to rein in online scams and a plan to phase out nuclear energy, as well as not going far enough in implementing transitional justice and promoting indigenous rights. \u201cUnder her reign, there has been a squeeze on airtime for more local and bread-and-butter issues,\u201d said Sung. \u201cAnd you see this reflected in the election results as well.\u201d Tsai\u2019s DPP suffered huge losses in two mid-term elections, where local issues normally trump national security as voters\u2019 primary concern. Near the end of her first term, Tsai\u2019s approval ratings plummeted and her chance for a second term was looking increasingly uncertain \u2013 until pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong in 2019 against Beijing\u2019s tightening grip. She campaigned heavily on promises to not allow Taiwan to become another Hong Kong, and received a landslide victory. In January\u2019s presidential elections, public grievances over livelihood issues became a focal point of criticism against the DPP, splitting votes \u2013 especially from young people \u2013 to a third-party candidate who promised a more \u201cscientific and pragmatic\u201d approach in addressing those issues. The DPP also lost its majority in the national legislature, leaving more potential political gridlock for the incoming Lai administration to push through policies and legislation. As Tsai hands the baton to Lai, analysts say it might still be too early to draw conclusions on her legacy. \u201cHow we ultimately judge her legacy will depend on what happens in the next administration as well, as in what they do with what Tsai has achieved,\u201d Hsiao said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/asia/tsai-taiwan-map-china-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 21-year-old\u2019s ranking was not high enough to earn direct entry to the tournament and she did not receive a wildcard, meaning she needed to go through the qualifiers. Despite initially being entered into the qualifying draw, the Briton pulled out before matches were due to start on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to keep laying on the foundations and I will use the time to do a healthy block before the grass and subsequent hard court seasons to give myself a chance to keep fit for the rest of the year,\u201d Raducanu said in a statement, per The Times tennis journalist Stuart Fraser. The French Open\u2019s main draw is set to start on May 26. As of the latest list, Raducanu is still the third alternate, meaning she could still have the chance to compete should three players drop out. CNN has reached out to Raducanu\u2019s agent for comment. Raducanu has not played a competitive match since her defeat by Maria Lourdes Carle at the Madrid Open in the first round on April 24.

{"id": "2024_05_19_asia_lai-chingte-taiwan-president-inauguration-intl-hnk", "text": "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te called on Beijing to cease its intimidation of the democratic island after he was was sworn in as president Monday, marking the start of a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has championed democracy in the face of years of growing threats\u00a0from authoritarian China. Lai, 64, a former doctor and vice president, was inaugurated alongside new Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan\u2019s top envoy to the United States. Both leaders and their party are openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says the self-ruling democracy is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. Lai used his 30-minute inaugural speech to broadcast a message of peace and declare that a \u201cglorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived,\u201d describing the island as an \u201cimportant link\u201d in a \u201cglobal chain of democracies,\u201d while reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty. \u201cThe future of the Republic of China Taiwan will be decided by its 23 million people. The future we decide is not just the future of our nation, but the future of the world,\u201d Lai said, using the formal name for Taiwan. Lai takes up the mantle from his DPP predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, who bolstered the island\u2019s international standing and recognition during her eight years in office. Tsai, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, was unable to stand again because of term limits. Lai emerged victorious over rivals in the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party and the Taiwan People\u2019s Party in a January election, which was fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its giant one-party state neighbor, China, which under leader Xi Jinping has grown more powerful and bellicose. Then, voters shrugged off warnings from Beijing that the DPP\u2019s re-election would increase the risk of conflict. The DPP holds the view that Taiwan is a de facto sovereign nation that should bolster defenses against China\u2019s threats and deepen relations with democratic countries. In his inaugural address, Lai called on China \u201cto cease their political and military intimidation against Taiwan, share with Taiwan the global responsibility of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as well as the greater region, and ensure the world is free from the fear of war.\u201d A soft-spoken political veteran, Lai hails from a more radical wing of the DPP, and was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence \u2013 a red line for Beijing. Though his views have tempered since then, China never forgave him for his comments from six years ago, in which he described himself as a \u201cpractical worker for Taiwan independence.\u201d Lai has now said he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that \u201cTaiwan is already an independent sovereign country\u201d so there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence, in a deliberately nuanced stance that mimics the one held by outgoing Tsai. When asked about Lai\u2019s inauguration in a regular briefing Monday, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said \u201cTaiwan independence is a dead end. No matter what pretext or banner one uses, promoting Taiwan independence and secession is doomed to fail.\u201d Lai\u2019s inauguration ceremony was attended by national leaders from a handful of countries with which Taiwan still maintains formal diplomatic ties, several former American officials, and lawmakers from other countries, according to Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered his congratulations to Lai and \u201cthe Taiwan people for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust and resilient democratic system.\u201d \u201cWe look forward to working with President Lai and across Taiwan\u2019s political spectrum to advance our shared interests and values, deepen our longstanding unofficial relationship, and maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Blinken said. Frictions with Beijing Lai takes office during a particularly contentious period between Taiwan and China, which in recent years has ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the self-governing democracy as Taiwan\u2019s leaders tightened informal ties with Washington. In his inaugural address, Lai said he hoped China would \u201cface the reality of the Republic of China\u2019s existence, respect the choices of the people of Taiwan,\u201d and \u201cengage in cooperation with the legal government chosen by Taiwan\u2019s people.\u201d He called for the resumption of tourism on a reciprocal basis and enrollment of degree students in Taiwanese institutions as steps to \u201cpursue peace and mutual prosperity.\u201d But the new president also warned against harboring delusions, even as Taiwan pursues \u201cthe ideals of peace.\u201d \u201cSo long as China refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, all of us in Taiwan ought to understand, that even if we accept the entirety of China\u2019s position and give up our sovereignty, China\u2019s ambition to annex Taiwan will not simply disappear,\u201d Lai said. Beijing has sought to portray Lai as inciting conflict, repeatedly framing the elections earlier this year as a choice between \u201cpeace and war.\u201d On Monday, China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated that rhetoric, slamming \u201cthe leader of the Taiwan region\u201d as \u201csending dangerous signals of seeking independence, provocations and undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\u201d Xi has placed \u201creunification\u201d with Taiwan as a key part of his goal to achieve China\u2019s \u201cnatural rejuvenation.\u201d But under the strongarm tactics of his more than one decade in power, Taiwan\u2019s public has shifted determinedly away from China. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3% identify primarily as Chinese. The majority of Taiwanese want to maintain the current status quo and show no desire to be ruled by Beijing. Beijing has cut official contact with Taipei since Tsai took office. Unlike the opposition KMT, Tsai and the DPP refused to endorse the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d that both Taiwan and the mainland belong to \u201cone China,\u201d but with different interpretations of what that means. Beijing, which deems the tacit agreement a precondition for dialogue. Official communication between Beijing and Taipei\u00a0is unlikely to resume as Lai takes office \u2013 with China repeatedly rebuking his offer for talks and denouncing him as a dangerous separatist. Lai is also set to face challenges \u2013 and scrutiny \u2013 in pushing through his agenda for Taiwan in parliament during his term. Unlike his predecessor, Lai will not have a parliamentary majority in the next four years. In January\u2019s election, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party only won 51 out of 113 seats. Those challenges were on show last Friday, when Taiwanese lawmakers\u2019 disagreements over new, controversial reform bills erupted in a brawl on the parliamentary floor \u2013 a chaotic display that saw some lawmakers leaping over tables and pulling colleagues to the floor, with a few members taken to hospital. In his address, Lai said that \u201ca lack of absolute majority means that the ruling and opposition parties are now all able to share their ideas, and that we will be undertaking the nation\u2019s challenges as one.\u201d But he also called for cooperation so Taiwan could \u201ccontinue down a stable path.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/asia/lai-chingte-taiwan-president-inauguration-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_asia_romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e", "text": "Moving from America to India as a child in the 1950s would likely be a challenging experience for most, but for Romulus Whitaker it was a dream come true \u2014 he had arrived in \u201cthe land of cobras,\u201d he explained to CNN. Whitaker would go on to earn the nickname \u201cSnakeman of India,\u201d and spend more than six decades dedicated to reptile research and conservation. He\u2019s written several books on snakes, spearheaded a lifesaving anti-venom program, and launched wildlife research stations throughout the country. His field work with snakes and crocodiles ultimately led his conservation efforts to help save India\u2019s rainforests. Today, Whitaker\u2019s focus is on educating Indians on how to protect themselves from snakes \u2014 part of a national campaign to reduce the snakebite mortality rate. CNN spoke with Whitaker recently at his home in Mysore, southwestern India, around the release of the first volume of his memoir: \u201cSnakes, Drugs and Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll: My Early Years.\u201d The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: How did you first become interested in snakes? Whitaker: I started out as a very young lad in northern New York state, turning over rocks and finding bugs and stuff, until I found a snake, and it was love at first sight. It really started then. But I must blame or thank my mother for when I first brought a snake home. She said, \u2018wow, how beautiful.\u2019 And now, which mother would do that? Not very many. Then, when my mother married Rama Chattopadhyay and we moved to India, that was something that opened up the world to me. Can you imagine an eight-year-old arriving in Bombay and being able to go out into the jungles of India? These are dreams that I had when I was a little kid, which came alive. CNN: What does a herpetologist do and what was your journey to becoming one? Whitaker: A herpetologist is a strange person who studies reptiles. I\u2019ve concentrated most of my work on snakes and crocodiles, but I am very interested in all the others \u2026 the turtles, the lizards, and of course the amphibians, the frogs and toads. I\u2019ve been doing this forever, ever since I was four years old when I picked up my first snake. [In 1960] I was going to college in America, but I flunked out. Then I got a job at the Miami Serpentarium and worked for this gentleman [Bill Haast] who handled king cobras with the greatest of ease and extracted their venom. That was part of the love affair that I generated for king cobras. But I had always yearned to come back to India and get out to Western Ghats, where I knew king cobras still lived, and start studying them. In 1969, I set up India\u2019s first snake park, the Madras Snake Park. And we\u2019ve learned more about king cobra behavior and about their wonderful lifestyle than had ever been known by anybody before. CNN: Have you ever been scared of a snake? Whitaker: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been scared of a snake. I\u2019ve been scared of myself sometimes doing stupid things. I saw a black-tailed [snake] disappearing into the bushes, and I thought, \u2018ah, big rat snake.\u2019 And I dove on it, typical football tackle, grabbed it by the tail and suddenly this hooded snake rises up over me and I looked up and said, \u2018oh no, I think I\u2019ve caught the wrong tail.\u2019 And I let it go. It was a king cobra, the first one I had ever found. It was scary. Okay, I am scared sometimes. CNN: How did you first get involved with the indigenous Irula tribe to help create anti-venom to treat people bitten by snakes? Whitaker: The Irulas are an aboriginal tribe here in South India. Their expertise is finding and catching snakes and their specialty [was] catching snakes for their skins. But they had run out of a way to make a living because the snakeskin industry had been banned [in 1972]. So we hatched an idea together to set up a venom cooperative, the Irula Snake Catchers Cooperative, wherein they would catch snakes from the wild, extract the venom, and then release the snakes back to the wild. And the venom, it was used to make anti-venom to save millions of lives. CNN: Today a big focus of your work is preventing snakebites in the first place. Tell us more about that. Whitaker: Up until recently, we really didn\u2019t know how many people are getting killed and injured by snakes. The Centre for Global Health Research and the University of Toronto started doing this Million Deaths Study. And I\u2019m a coauthor of two of the major papers produced out of this study, and it turns out that close to 50,000 people are actually killed by snake bite every year in India. Now that we know the figure, we are working very hard right now on an educational program, which is nationwide, trying to teach people how to avoid snakes and avoid getting bitten. It\u2019s fairly simple: at night when you walk around, use a light. When you sleep, use a mosquito net. We tell people when they\u2019re working in the field, when they\u2019re doing agriculture, use a stick. Don\u2019t use your bare hand because a snake could be there. So it\u2019s just educating people. These are simple methods. CNN: At what point in your career did you get involved with conservation? Whitaker: My early, formative years were not very conservation-oriented. I was the kid with a gun, and I would go out there and instead of being a bird watcher, I was a bird shooter. The transition from being from a hunter to a conservationist happened [in the 1970s] when I realized that things were really out of hand here, and crocodiles were almost extinct by that time. And we really had to do something about it. I realized that unless I got into conservation, there\u2019s not going to be anything left. I set up field stations along with my colleagues and they are magnets for people who want to get into working with reptiles. And we\u2019ve had dozens and dozens of people who have now turned out to be some of the greatest conservationists in India we can call graduates of these stations. CNN: You\u2019re currently working on a three-part memoir. What would you like your legacy to be? Whitaker: People will remember me, like it or not, as a snake freak. But it\u2019s wonderful to think [of] the influence that I have had or that our organizations have had to engender this incredible deep interest in something which people sneered at or ran away from all their lives, but now suddenly, hey, they\u2019re interesting, they\u2019re hip, they\u2019re in. Snakes rule! And it\u2019s wonderful to realize that dozens, if not hundreds, of young people have continued to do wonderful work with reptiles. It\u2019s just wonderful.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/asia/romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_weather_houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south", "text": "As officials assess the damage from destructive storms in the Houston area that killed at least seven people and knocked out power amid rising temperatures, residents in the Southeast and Gulf Coast face a severe weather threat through Saturday that could bring another round of excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorms. A complex of storms with winds up to 100 mph and a tornado left a trail of destruction Thursday across the Houston area that damaged multiple skyscrapers, caused a sewage spill and triggered power outages that could stretch on for weeks amid soaring temperatures. At least four people died from the storm in Houston, including two killed by fallen trees and a third who died in a crane accident, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said Thursday. Another three storm deaths were reported in Harris County on Friday evening. One man collapsed while trying to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and sparked a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X. Gonzalez said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank and was found unresponsive Friday morning. \u201cHeartbreaking! My condolences go out to the families that lost a loved one during yesterday\u2019s severe weather event,\u201d Gonzalez said. The damaging storms will be followed by high temperatures in the 90s through the weekend and beyond while many are without air conditioning. Over 366,000 customers in Harris County remain without power Saturday evening following the line of storms, down from a peak of more than 900,000, according to PowerOutage.us. Authorities have warned that restoring power to all customers will be a lengthy process. CenterPoint Energy \u2013 the primary electrical provider in the area \u2013 said the storm system caused \u201cextensive damage to the company\u2019s transmission and distribution electric systems.\u201d Thousands of workers are being deployed to help with restoration efforts, the company said. More than 376,000\u00a0of its customers have been affected and power was restored to more than 259,000\u00a0customers in the last 24 hours as of Saturday night, the company said on its website. \u201cCenterPoint Energy is working to have restorations substantially complete to customers who are available to receive service by end of day Wednesday,\u201d CenterPoint Energy said. \u201cHardest hit areas of our territory include: Bellaire, Cypress, Baytown, Greenspoint, Humble and Spring Branch.\u201d The rainfall, combined with high winds and power outages, also resulted in the spillage of more than 100,000 gallons of domestic wastewater, otherwise known as sanitary sewage. The spillage occurred in three separate locations across the city, but Houston Public Works assured residents that drinking water from the City of Houston remains safe. With burgeoning heat, the City of Houston opened cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. \u201cThe weather pattern is shifting into a hot and dry pattern starting on Saturday, so it is going to be important to have a way to stay cool,\u201d the National Weather Service warned on Friday. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said. The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana Thursday as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The determination was made based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. More flash floods and damaging wind gusts possible Saturday Excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorm chances will persist across parts of the Southeast through Saturday, the National Weather Service said. From the Southeast to the north-central Gulf of Mexico, newly developing thunderstorms will bring the potential for more flash flooding and damaging wind gusts on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. A slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms has been issued across parts of the Southeast into the Carolinas on Saturday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cIsolated to scattered severe thunderstorms appear possible across portions of the Southeast and Carolinas on Saturday, and parts of the Upper Midwest,\u201d the center said. \u201cDamaging winds should be the main threat, but occasional severe hail and a tornado or two may also occur.\u201d A slight level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall has also been issued for part of the northern Gulf Coast Saturday due to the threat of flash, urban and riverine flooding, the weather service said. Heavy rain is also forecast to continue into Saturday across the Mid-Atlantic and central Appalachians, where scattered instances of flash flooding could occur. On Sunday, thunderstorms are expected to form over the central High Plains and spread east in the evening. The greatest chances for severe weather are across parts of Nebraska and Kansas, with a slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms issued by the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cLarge hail and damaging gusts will be the main hazards, though a tornado or two also will be possible,\u201d the center said. By the end of the weekend, thunderstorm chances will diminish for most of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/weather/houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

The prime minister, 59, was hit by four bullets on Wednesday in an attack that raised alarm over the polarized state of politics in the central European country of 5.4 million people. Kalinak told journalists that Fico\u2019s condition was still too serious to consider transferring him to hospital in the capital. But the worst fears had passed for now. \u201cWhen we were saying that we want to get closer to a positive prognosis, then I believe that we are a step closer to that,\u201d he added. \u201cThe prime minister has stepped away from his life being in danger, but his condition remains serious and requires intensive care.\u201d The shooting was the first major assassination attempt on a European political leader for more than 20 years, and has drawn international condemnation.

On the horizon, views of the Andes are as spectacular as ever, their snow-capped peaks gleaming extra bright after an early-season storm. Santiago is under a record freeze. After an eight-day \u201ccold wave\u201d pushed through the capital region this week, the average temperature for May dropped to 37 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) \u2013 the coldest since 1950, according to Ang\u00e9lica Guz\u00e1man, a meteorologist with the Chilean Meteorologic Directorate. Thursday marked the coldest day of the year so far, with one weather station notching a frosty 30 degrees. \u201cYou have to go out dressed in double layers,\u201d said Rosita Moya, a publicist who spoke with CNN on a frigid Friday morning, the fur-lined hood of her parka turned up. \u201cI had to go searching for my hat.\u201d Chileans are used to the cold, but not this early in the year. A typical May\u00a0in Santiago\u00a0reaches a balmy high of 64 degrees, dipping down to 43 degrees at night. The brunt of the winter arrives in July, when the average low is down to 37 degrees. A mass of cold air that will last through the weekend is behind the strange forecast, Guz\u00e1man said, with below-average temperatures expected to continue. Authorities have declared a \u201ccode blue\u201d throughout the country, opening additional shelters and services for homeless populations. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be prepared: warm clothes, closed shoes, protection for your hands.

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_ai-high-school", "text": "At Princeton High School, students are trying to combat the rapid decline of indigenous languages with some unlikely help: a furry, wide-eyed stuffed animal named Che\u2019w. But Che\u2019w isn\u2019t a standard plush toy. He\u2019s a wildly intelligent generative AI robot that speaks Mam, a Mayan language spoken in the western highlands of Guatemala and Mexico and by a small population of the school\u2019s students.\u00a0The language is currently at risk of extinction, according to UNESCO; the students hope Che\u2019w can help change that. At a time when some high schools are restricting the use of AI in the classroom, others, like Princeton High School, are leaning into it. In the short 18 months since the launch of viral chatbot ChatGPT, generative AI has emerged as a revolutionary technology in the field of artificial intelligence. Its capabilities have impressed both users and experts with its ability to perform a range of tasks, from generating creative content, essays and games to conducting mathematical equations, summarizing complicated concepts and more. All that is already reshaping various parts of our lives, including education. But the technology has leaped ahead far faster, in many cases, than schools\u2019 understanding of how to use it. And with new products out this week from Google\u2019s XYZ initiative and OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o, many teachers and districts realize they cannot avoid the subject. Dr. Joy Barnes-Johnson, the science administrator for PHS, said the school is \u201ctrying to embrace AI\u201d as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool, just like a pencil is technology that helps communication.\u201d She said the school will host an AI summit this summer with its teachers and administrators to have a conversation about how generative AI should or shouldn\u2019t be used in the classroom. \u201cIn the beginning of the school year, we talked about how AI is the world we\u2019re in now and we have a responsibility to prepare kids for the world they will inherit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is that it will help people connect and learn, so we [as teachers] have to not be afraid of it.\u201d Proceeding with caution When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, teachers worried that the tool, which can generate convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts, could make it easier for students to cheat on assignments. Some also worried ChatGPT and similar tools could be used to spread inaccurate information. Not long after its launch, New York City public schools became one of the first school districts to ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district\u2019s networks and devices. Other schools reacted similarly in the weeks and months that followed, including the Los Angeles Unified School District and Seattle Public Schools, which blocked access to ChatGPT on their networks. Some of these districts have evolved their policies over time. The LAUSD, for example, has since launched a chatbot named \u201cEd\u201d to act as a student advisor, with the ability to inform parents about information ranging from children\u2019s test results to their school attendance. Many schools also continue to grapple with how to best approach the technology inside the classroom. \u201cThere is acceptance by educators, but we\u2019re still seeing a lot of caution,\u201d said Noel Candelaria, the secretary-treasurer of the National Education Association who is leading the charge around the union\u2019s AI policy. \u201cThe challenge is there isn\u2019t a lot of guidance on the district level, so the concern educators have is that it\u2019s being something done to them, instead of with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are also major concerns around data confidentiality and where data is being pulled from.\u201d Candelaria told CNN that educators feel strongly that they want their voice to influence how it can be applied to schools. The NEA is developing a task force with educators across the country to address many of these issues. Beyond generative AI Some high schools around the country are\u00a0trying to teach students how to use other forms of artificial intelligence for a greater good. At one prestigious public school in New York City, Stuyvesant High School, students created an app for the blind that uses artificial intelligence and tactile feedback to help people detect threats and navigate obstacles.  Similarly, at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado, a team of students developed an AI-powered\u00a0wildlife detection system called Project Deer to help cut down on car crashes. Although researchers have tried to combat such accidents before, studies have shown wildlife don\u2019t consistently react to any one stimulus. So the students instead derived an AI-based predictive solution to alert the driver to an imminent threat on the road. Using four $5 infrared detection sensors placed on vehicles, the students developed a system for\u00a0AI to scan the surroundings and emit a high-pitched sound when an animal\u2019s body heat is detected, a signal that may help to scare the animal away. The school, which was the\u00a0Colorado State Winner in Samsung\u2019s annual Solve for Tomorrow competition, said it is partnering with the University of Colorado in Boulder this summer to help boost its success rate. The Solve for Tomorrow contest featured more than 1,000 schools submitting STEM-based solutions to real-world problems. Samsung told CNN there was a \u201cdefinite uptick in\u201d submitted AI-powered innovations this year compared to previous years. Computer science teacher Tylor Chacon told CNN the group\u2019s big vision is to one day have the technology regulated or adopted by the state for greater use. School administration has told teachers to help create rubrics or lesson plans, Chacon told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged to embrace it and look into ways we can use it to maximize our own job effectiveness and ease the burden on us,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an increasingly common trend among teachers to use AI tools to create assignments, quizzes, polls, videos and interactives for classroom use. Some are even turning to AI tools and platforms \u2014 such as ChatGPT, Writable, Grammarly and EssayGrader \u2014 to assist with grading papers or writing feedback, a practice that is also raising ethical considerations. Saving a language, learning the future Still, as schools continue to weigh the benefits or disadvantages to teaching and using artificial intelligence, some teachers and administrators feel strongly that it\u2019s the future. At Princeton High, a group of about 14 students met during school hours for months to build out Che\u2019w\u2019s conversational capabilities, drawn from artificial intelligence neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns, solve problems and understand words, sentences and phrases from spoken and written language. Che\u2019w, which translates to \u201cstar\u201d in Mam, was trained to understand the language by the students so it can serve as a personal tutor. The robot is also trained to speak Spanish and English. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t lose patience or get sick of talking to them,\u201d said Mark Eastburn, Princeton High School\u2019s science, research and engineering teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s taking [AI] off the screen and putting it onto a physical structure that looks like a friend that can help you do whatever you need to do.\u201d In April, the students were one of the top three National Winners at the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow\u2019s competition. AI is now a part of students\u2019 lives, Eastburn said. \u201cAnd it will be there when they\u2019re in college and also in their careers,\u201d he added, \u201cso they might as well learn and use it in appropriate ways in high school, if not even earlier.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/ai-high-school/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_world_blue-origin-rocket-ns-25-mission-scn", "text": "Blue Origin\u2019s tourism rocket has launched passengers to the edge of space for the first time in nearly two years, ending a hiatus prompted by a failed uncrewed test flight. The New Shepard rocket and capsule lifted off at 9:36 a.m. CT (10:36 a.m. ET) from the Jeff Bezos-founded company\u2019s facilities on a private ranch in West Texas. NS-25, Blue Origin\u2019s seventh crewed flight to date, carried six customers aboard the capsule: venture capitalist Mason Angel; Sylvain Chiron, founder of the French craft brewery Brasserie Mont-Blanc; software engineer and entrepreneur Kenneth L. Hess; retired accountant Carol Schaller; aviator\u00a0Gopi Thotakura; and Ed Dwight, a retired US Air Force captain selected by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to be the nation\u2019s first Black astronaut candidate. Despite completing training at the Aerospace Research Pilot School\u00a0and receiving an Air Force recommendation, Dwight ultimately didn\u2019t make the NASA Astronaut Corps. He went on to become an entrepreneur and a sculptor; a new National Geographic documentary on Black astronauts, \u201cThe Space Race,\u201d highlights Dwight\u2019s pioneering story. \u201cI had no intention of being an astronaut. That was the last thing on my bucket list,\u201d Dwight said in the documentary. \u201cBut once I was given the challenge, then everything changes.\u201d Dwight completed that challenge and reached the edge of space at the age of 90, making him the oldest person to venture to such heights, according to a spokesperson from Blue Origin. \u201cI thought I didn\u2019t need it in my life,\u201d Dwight said of the experience on Blue Origin\u2019s livestream after the capsule touched down at 9:46 a.m. CT (10:46 a.m. ET). \u201cBut I lied. I really, really did need it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a life-changing experience,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody needs to do this.\u201d The rocket booster landed safely a couple minutes prior to the capsule. During the mission, the crew soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. The rocket vaulted the capsule past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, an area 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface that is\u00a0widely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot of\u00a0gray area. And at the peak of the flight, passengers experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and striking views of Earth through the cabin windows. The launch followed the success of an uncrewed science mission in December \u2014 the New Shepard program\u2019s first flight since the mishap more than a year earlier. New Shepard\u2019s 2022 failure A New Shepard rocket and spacecraft were set to launch a batch of science instruments on September 12, 2022. But one minute into flight, the rocket endured Max Q \u2014 an aerospace term that refers to a moment of maximum stress on a vehicle. It occurs when the rocket is at a relatively low altitude \u2014 where the atmosphere is still fairly thick \u2014 but the spacecraft is moving at high speeds, creating a moment of intense pressure on the vehicle. Around that time, the rocket appeared to emit a massive burst of flames. The New Shepard capsule, which rides atop the rocket, then initiated its launch abort system \u2014 firing up a small engine to blast itself safely away from the malfunctioning rocket. That system worked as intended, parachuting the capsule to a safe landing. Blue Origin later\u00a0revealed\u00a0that the cause of the failure was a problem with the engine nozzle, a large cone that directs the flaming exhaust at the rocket\u2019s bottom. Onboard computers accurately detected the failure and shut the engine down, according to the company. No injuries were reported on the ground, and Blue Origin said the science payloads and the capsule could be flown again. But the rocket, left without a functioning engine, smashed back into the ground\u00a0and was destroyed. Typically after New Shepard launches, the rocket booster guides itself back to a safe upright landing so it can be flown again. During a December interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Bezos\u00a0said the escape system that jettisoned the capsule to safety is the most difficult piece of engineering in the entire rocket \u2014 but \u201cit is the reason that I am comfortable letting anyone go on New Shepard.\u201d \u201cThe (rocket) booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it,\u201d Bezos added. \u201cThe power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong. \u2026 So the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system. \u201cA tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view \u2026 to be as safe as one can make it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it perfectly safe. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d Rocket fix and return to service The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches and is charged with ensuring public safety, oversaw an investigation into the failure. The probe revealed that the engine nozzle failed because it experienced higher temperatures than what the company had anticipated. To fix the issue, Blue Origin said it implemented \u201cdesign changes to the combustion chamber\u201d \u2014 the area of the engine where fuel explosively mixes with oxidizer \u2014 and adjusted \u201coperating parameters,\u201d or the data that the company uses to model safe flights. \u201cAdditional design changes to the nozzle have improved structural performance under thermal and dynamic loads,\u201d the company said in a March 2023\u00a0statement. The FAA formally concluded the mishap investigation on September 27, 2023, outlining 21 \u201ccorrective actions\u201d Blue Origin needed to implement before returning to flight. The agency did not reveal details on what those actions were,\u00a0noting the report\u00a0\u201ccontains proprietary data and U.S \u00a0Export Control\u00a0information and is not available for public release.\u201d The changes and New Shephard\u2019s successful December flight teed up the company to restart its trips to space for thrill seekers. Before the September 2022 failure, New Shepard rockets had flown 22 consecutive successful missions \u2014 including six with passengers on board.\u00a0Bezos flew aboard the rocket\u00a0in 2021. Other notable space tourists previously carried by the vehicle include \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor William Shatner and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d host Michael Strahan.

{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_mohamed-amra-france-prison-attack-intl", "text": "A rare episode of violence disrupted the peaceful region of Normandy in northern France on Tuesday when gunmen ambushed a prison convoy to spring a notorious prison inmate known as \u201cThe Fly.\u201d The attack took place while prisoner Mohamed Amra, 30, was being transported from a court hearing in Rouen to a nearby prison in \u00c9vreux, and has led to a massive manhunt. The prison convoy was driving on a motorway when it came under heavy gunfire, resulting in the deaths of two prison guards, while three others were seriously injured. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the escaped inmate, as a search involving hundreds of police officers enters its second day. \u2018Well known\u2019 to authorities Mohamed Amra, nicknamed \u201cLa Mouche\u201d or \u201cThe Fly,\u201d is \u201cvery well known\u201d to the French justice system having sustained a total of 13 convictions, according to Paris state prosecutor Laure Beccuau. A judicial court in Marseilles is currently investigating Amra for a string of offenses including complicity in premeditated murder in an organized gang, complicity in kidnapping and the taking of hostages, according to Beccuau. CNN\u2019s affiliate in France, BFMTV, reports that the 30-year-old is a suspected narcotics boss. Amra\u2019s lawyer, Hugues Vivier, disputes this, saying there had been nothing to alert authorities to his client having a \u201cparticularly dangerous\u201d profile. Beccuau told journalists that Amra\u2019s criminal record does not contain any convictions for drug-related offenses. Most of his convictions relate to incidents of theft with aggravated offenses, Beccuau said, adding that he had been incarcerated in various facilities since January 2022. On May 10,\u00a0Amra\u00a0was found guilty on the charge of burglary by a court in \u00c9vreux, resulting in a prison sentence of 18 months. He is also under investigation in Marseille for a kidnap which led to a death, Beccuau said. As part of his statement last night, Beccuau said that Amra had been placed under security level three - meaning he was not a high-security prisoner. This is why only five officers were involved in escorting him from the court back to prison. Amra, who was born in the city of Rouen in northern France, was first convicted by authorities in October 2009 aged 15 years old, according to Beccuau. It is understood that Amra had attempted to escape from \u00c9vreux prison two days prior to the ambush. Speaking to BFMTV, Emmanuel Baudin, a union leader of prison guards, said: \u201cWe know that he tried to escape two or three days ago by sawing off the bars of his cell. So colleagues moved him to a disciplinary unit.\u201d In an interview on French radio, Amra\u2019s mother said she broke down crying when she heard about the deadly ambush. \u201cI broke down, I cried.\u00a0Really I wasn\u2019t well. How can lives be taken like that? It makes me sick \u2026\u00a0It\u2019s serious,\u201d she told France\u2019s RTL radio network. Manhunt underway A massive manhunt has been launched to find Amra and the gunmen who carried out the prison break. Interpol put out a red notice \u2013 a request for worldwide law enforcement officials to locate and provisionally arrest that person \u2013 for Amra. It is not, as Interpol points out, an international arrest warrant. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on X he has mobilized the national gendarmerie and \u201cseveral hundred\u201d police officers for the manhunt. French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told reporters that the incident was the first time a French prison employee has died while working since 1992. French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X that \u201cevery effort is being made to find the perpetrators of this crime so that justice can be done in the name of the French people.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/europe/mohamed-amra-france-prison-attack-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_middleeast_gaza-floating-pier-aid-trucks-intl-hnk", "text": "Trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza have begun moving ashore after arriving through the floating pier built by the US military, according to the US Central Command (CENTCOM). The pier was anchored to a beach in Gaza on Thursday and will be used to funnel aid from various countries into the besieged strip, with most border crossings to the enclave closed and a catastrophic humanitarian disaster unfolding inside. No US troops went ashore in Gaza, according to CENTCOM. The goal is to get about 500 tons of humanitarian assistance into Gaza through the pier daily, according to Adm. Brad Cooper, the commander of CENTCOM. That means about 90 trucks worth of aid a day, and the goal is to build up to 150 trucks a day. Over 300 pallets of humanitarian aid were delivered to Gaza through a new floating pier installed by the US military, according to a statement from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday. On Friday, the UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, said Gaza was facing a \u201cdire\u201d food situation with barely more than 300 aid trucks entering the strip since Israel began its offensive in Rafah. The maritime corridor is coming at a critical moment \u2013 with the Rafah border crossing to Gaza having been closed for more than a week, preventing aid from getting through. That crossing was the only one between Gaza and Egypt \u2013 with all other border points in the strip controlled by Israel. Here\u2019s what we know about the new aid route: How was the pier built and how will it work? The US began building the floating pier in late April at a cost of $320 million and with the help of some 1,000 US soldiers and sailors. The US said that it is only a temporary measure that is \u201centirely humanitarian in nature.\u201d Pieces for the pier were loaded aboard ships on the East Coast of the US and then \u201ctransported 6,000 miles across the ocean,\u201d according to CENTCOM\u2019s Cooper. The pieces were assembled off the coast of Gaza, with final assembly taking place in the Israeli port of Ashdod. The aid delivered via the pier will go through several steps before reaching Gaza. It will arrive in Cyprus by either air or sea where it will be screened by the US and Israel and palletized before being brought by ship to a floating platform near the Gaza coast. Then it is finally transported to the floating pier and loaded onto trucks to distribute on land. The US has said the pier is not meant to replace aid that enters through land crossings, which aid workers have said are the fastest and easiest way to get relief into the territory. \u201cThis maritime route is additive and is not meant to replace land routes into Gaza,\u201d Cooper said. The UN\u2019s World Food Programme will be responsible for receiving and distributing the aid in Gaza. Why is aid being shipped this way? Most land crossings into Gaza remain either shut or congested due to lengthy inspections by Israel. That has led the US and other countries to start air-dropping aid into Gaza, which human rights organizations have criticized as insufficient. The UN has warned of famine setting in in parts of Gaza, calling on Israel to open more land crossings for aid. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, the top US humanitarian official, has also assessed it is \u201ccredible\u201d that famine is already occurring in parts of Gaza. In March, the first batch of humanitarian aid by sea was delivered in an operation separate from the US pier project. Today, only the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing and the \u201cWestern Erez\u201d Crossing in northern Gaza are open, although the amount of aid trickling through them is nowhere close to what Gaza needs. The UN\u2019s World Food Programme however says that since May 6, when Israel launched its Rafah operation, the organization has been unable to access and receive aid from the Kerem Shalom crossing. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\u00a0(UNRWA) said the crossing was closed between May 6-10. The Rafah crossing with Egypt, the entry point for nearly a quarter of all aid into Gaza, was also closed last week after Israel seized it as part of a ground offensive into the city, and is yet to reopen. How much aid is getting into Gaza now? The US State Department has said that \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d trucks are getting into Gaza. The UN estimates that 500 trucks are needed per day to alleviate the suffering of Gazans, but on May 11, UN figures showed that only six trucks entered. No data is available after that date. The UN agency stressed that more aid should be allowed to pass through checkpoints and enter Gaza by land. \u201cAny and all aid into Gaza is welcome by any route. However, getting aid to people in need, into and across Gaza, cannot and should not depend on a floating dock,\u201d OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke said Friday. Israel however said on Friday\u00a0that \u201caid is flowing into Gaza by land, sea, and air\u201d and through \u201cmultiple aid routes.\u201d The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli body that coordinates the flow of aid into the strip, said that 365 trucks \u201cwere transferred\u201d to Gaza Thursday. The UN\u2019s OCHA on Thursday said that crossings into Gaza have either been closed, are unsafe to access or not logistically viable. \u201cAid distribution is almost impossible with no regular fuel imports, unstable telecommunication and ongoing fighting,\u201d OCHA said on X. \u201cThe impact is devastating for over 2 million people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/middleeast/gaza-floating-pier-aid-trucks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_mallory-disappeared-everest-summit-mystery", "text": "It\u2019s one of climbing\u2019s greatest mysteries: was Everest really conquered for the first time in 1953, or did two mountaineers make it to the summit in 1924, before dying in mysterious circumstances? British climbers George Mallory and Andrew \u201cSandy\u201d Irvine were last seen on June 8, 1924, 800 feet below the peak, before disappearing into clouds. They never reemerged. When Mallory\u2019s body was found in 1999, hopes were high that it might give a clue as to whether the pair reached the summit. But, tantalizingly, the camera he had been carrying \u2013 with which he would have documented the highest point they had reached \u2013 was not on the body. Irvine\u2019s body has never been found. But now, as the 100th anniversary of the mens\u2019 disappearance approaches, one researcher believes that he has solved mountaineering\u2019s greatest mystery. By studying the expedition weather reports, author Graham Hoyland believes that he has worked out what happened to the pair \u2013 and whether they made it to the summit before they died. Hoyland \u2013 a distant relative of another member of the expedition group, who has visited on Everest nine times searching for the remains \u2013 believes that the key to the mystery is air pressure. His relative several times removed, Howard Somervell \u2013 another mountaineer, who had got within 1,000 feet of the summit on the same expedition before a lack of oxygen meant he had to retreat \u2013 was responsible for tracking the weather during the expedition. The smoking gun? His records \u2013 which he submitted after the official report on the 1924 expedition was made, having returned to his job as a surgeon in India \u2013 show that the barometric pressure dropped between the morning of June 8 and June 9 at base camp, where Somervell was taking the readings. Somervell recorded the pressure in inches of mercury, dropping from 16.25 to 15.98. Hoyland believes that these figures equate to a 10 millibar drop in pressure. Weather-related deaths on Everest are generally associated with a drop in barometric pressure at the summit. A decrease of just 4 millibars can trigger hypoxia; a 6 millibar drop was enough to cause the incident in 1996 in which 20 people were trapped on the mountain, eight of whom died. That story is recounted in writer Jon Krakauer\u2019s book \u201cInto Thin Air.\u201d The bad weather angle was also explored in a 2010 paper by experts from the University of Toronto, led by G.W. Kent Moore. \u201cThey were climbing into an absolute s***storm \u2013 not only a blizzard but a sort of snow bomb,\u201d Hoyland told CNN. Hoyland has experienced \u201csnow bombs\u201d himself on Everest. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying \u2013 the temperature drops hugely, you\u2019re gasping for breath. There are winds of 100 knots. One guy I know was blown off the mountain, and ended up further up the mountain,\u201d he said. Effectively, the drop in air pressure meant that the mountain suddenly became higher \u2013 around 650 feet higher, to be precise. Hoyland calls it \u201can invisible death trap.\u201d The pair \u2013 who were ascending along the northwest ridge \u2013 were already climbing against the odds. Mallory wrote in a letter to his wife that he put his chances of making the summit at 50 to one. Hoyland thinks it was more like 20 to one. But, he thinks, they would have had no idea what was about to hit them. \u201cMallory had seen Norton and Somervell get to to within 1000 feet of the top on 4 June using no oxygen equipment; it would have seemed reasonable to assume that it was possible to reach the summit with the apparatus,\u201d he writes in a forthcoming book. \u201cWhat he didn\u2019t know was that the rapidly falling air pressure was effectively making the mountain even higher. What\u2019s more, the storm and blizzard wouldn\u2019t just have made a drop in air pressure. The pair were wearing layers of silk, cotton and wool. Hoyland \u2013 who had a similar made-to-measure outfit on an Everest trip \u2013 says that the clothes are exceptionally comfortable but wouldn\u2019t have provided the warmth to survive a blizzard or an overnight. Previously, it has been speculated that the pair had reached the summit before dying on the way down, something that Hoyland calls \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d been trying to prove that Mallory had climbed Everest for years and years \u2013 I wanted to prove that I was the 16th Briton to climb it, not the 15th. But unfortunately when you read facts and they\u2019re different, you have to change your mind. You can\u2019t carry on being a wishful thinker,\u201d he says. Until Hoyland, nobody had closely studied at the weather reports, which were held at the Royal Geographical Society in London. The summit was eventually reached by Edmund Hillary, a New Zealand mountaineer, in 1953 \u2013 the first documented ascent of the peak. A century of speculation The mystery of Mallory and Irvine has intrigued adventurers for decades. In 1933, another mountaineer, Percy Wyn-Harris found an ax near the summit. It was assumed to have belonged to Irvine. In 1936, another mountaineer, Frank Smythe, believed he had seen two bodies in the distance. Using a telescope, he saw them at around 8,100 meters, or 26,575 feet. And Chinese mountaineer Wang Hongbao believed he saw a body during his 1975 ascent. Finally, an expedition in 1999, instigated by Hoyland, found Mallory\u2019s body at 26,700 feet \u20132,335 below the summit. Hoyland believes that the pair, tethered to each other, slipped while aborting the climb and returning to base camp. He thinks Mallory survived the initial fall, but took another, fatal plunge while staggering back to base camp. Irvine\u2019s body has never been found. Everest \u2018makes people mad\u2019 While some of Mallory\u2019s possessions were still to be found on his body, including a pair of goggles in his pocket \u2013 which suggests he was either in darkness or poor visibility \u2013 there was no sign of the photo of his wife which he had brought, planning to leave it on the summit. For decades, researchers have posited that, in lieu of more precise evidence, the lack of photo suggests the pair might have reached the summit and fallen while returning. However, having reviewed the new evidence, Hoyland believes this is not the case. Expedition reports noted a blizzard hitting the mountain at 2 p.m., he says \u2013 long before they could have reached the summit. The lack of photo, he thinks, means nothing. Mallory often forgot stuff, he notes. In his last letter to his wife \u2013 digitized to mark the centenary of his ascent \u2013 on May 27, Mallory wrote of \u201clooking out of a tent door onto a world of snow and vanishing hopes: and described it as \u201ca bad time altogether.\u201d Both he and Irvine were unwell, and he wrote that \u201cI\u2019m quite doubtful if I shall be fit enough.\u201d For Hoyland, who is taking part in an event at the Royal Geographical Society about the centenary, \u201cEverest makes people mad.\u201d \u201cMallory became obsessed with the desire to conquer Everest \u2013 it would have made him somebody,\u201d he said. Mallory was a teacher, but moved on the fringes of the Bloomsbury set, a group of British intellectuals, artists and thinkers centered on London in the early 20th century. \u201cEveryone he knew was a famous novelist or a Nobel prizewinner, and he got captivated by it [the idea of Everest],\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a dangerous thing called \u2018summit fever\u2019 \u2013 you see the summit, and you think, \u2018Right, it\u2019s death or glory.\u2019 You don\u2019t care if you die. \u201cI know that feeling. You get completely possessed by this mountain. Mallory was possessed by Everest and it killed him.\u201d Hoyland, who has since swapped mountaineering for extreme sailing, says that Everest has become \u201ca non-mountaineer\u2019s mountain.\u201d \u201cThere are rich men climbing it as a trophy. I wish it wasn\u2019t the highest,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite honestly I think the best thing to happen would be if the top 800 feet fell off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/mallory-disappeared-everest-summit-mystery/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_19_middleeast_iran-ebrahim-raisi-crash-intl-hnk", "text": "Ultraconservative Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi\u00a0was killed Sunday, along with his foreign minister, in a\u00a0helicopter crash in Iran\u2019s remote northwest,\u00a0injecting fresh uncertainty\u00a0as the country\u2019s hardline clerical establishment navigates\u00a0rising regional\u00a0tensions and domestic\u00a0discontent. The loss of two of Iran\u2019s most influential political figures comes as the country buckles under significant economic and political strain, with tensions with nearby Israel at a dangerous high. Drone footage of the helicopter wreckage taken by the Red Crescent and carried on Iranian state media showed the crash site on a steep, wooded hillside, with little remaining of the helicopter beyond a blue and white tail. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei \u2013 the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the country \u2013 announced five days of public mourning and confirmed that Iran\u2019s First Vice President, Mohammad Mokhber, is now managing the executive branch. Sunday\u2019s crash occurred as Raisi, 63, and Foreign Minister\u00a0Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were returning from a ceremony for an opening of a dam on Iran\u2019s border with Azerbaijan, state media reported. Among those onboard were three crew members, the governor of Eastern Azerbaijan province, an imam, Raisi\u2019s head of security chief and a bodyguard, according to IRGC-run media outlet Sepah. The crash prompted an hours-long search-and-rescue operation with assistance from the European Union and Turkey among others, but emergency crews were hampered by the thick fog and plummeting temperatures. CNN confirmed the geolocation of the crash site to the mountainous region in Varzeghan, near the village of Uzi, in Iran\u2019s East Azerbaijan province. The death of Raisi comes at a sensitive time domestically for Tehran and seven months into Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza that has sent tensions soaring throughout the Middle East \u2014 and brought a decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran out into the open. Last month, Iran launched an unprecedented\u00a0drone and missile attack\u00a0on Israel \u2014 its first ever direct attack on the country \u2014 in response to a deadly apparent Israeli airstrike on\u00a0Iran\u2019s consulate in Damascus. Under Raisi, Iran\u2019s hardline leadership has faced significant challenges in recent years, convulsed by youth-led demonstrations against clerical rule and grim economic conditions. Iranian authorities have launched a widening crackdown on dissent since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death of a young woman in the custody of the country\u2019s notorious morality police. Following the official announcement of Raisi\u2019s death Monday, Iran\u2019s government convened an \u201curgent meeting\u201d as the clerical establishment, headed by Khamenei, prepare to appoint a new president they can throw their support behind. The Iranian constitution also mandates that the three heads of the branches of government, including the Vice President, speaker of the parliament, and head of the judiciary, must arrange for an election and elect a new leader within 50 days of assuming the role of acting\u00a0President. In a statement Monday, the president\u2019s cabinet praised Raisi as a \u201chard-working and tireless\u201d president who served the people of Iran to help advance and progress the country. \u201c[He] stood by his promise and sacrificed his life for the nation,\u201d the statement said. The cabinet, seeking to affirm calm in the country, also insisted there \u201cwill not be the slightest disturbance\u201d in the administration of Iran in the wake of the deadly crash. On Monday, Iranian state broadcasters took to airing Islamic prayers in between news broadcasts, while a photo shared by IRNA showed that the chair that Raisi usually sits in was vacant and draped with a black sash in memory of the president. A president groomed for real power Raisi came to Iran\u2019s presidency from the judiciary, where he drew attention from both the Iranian clerical elite and Western critics for his hardline approach to dissent and human rights in the country. In 2019 \u2014 the same year that Raisi became Iran\u2019s chief justice \u2014 he was sanctioned by the US, citing his participation in the 1988 \u201cdeath commission\u201d as a prosecutor and a\u00a0United Nations report\u00a0on the judicial execution of at least nine children between 2018 and 2019. The\u00a0Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI)\u00a0has accused him of crimes against humanity for being part of the committee that oversaw the execution of up to 5,000 political prisoners in 1988. Raisi has never commented on these allegations. For Iran\u2019s ruling establishment, though, Raisi seemed to be made in the image of the 1979 Islamic Revolution\u2019s ideals, a guarantor of its continuation even as many chafed under its ultraconservative rules. In 2021, he was elected to the presidency in a contest heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic\u2019s political elite so that he would run virtually unchallenged. Raisi\u2019s inauguration was seen to signal the start of a new harder-line era in Iran. Many activists accused Iran\u2019s clerical establishment of \u201cselecting\u201d rather than electing the next president in a poll designed to further entrench the power of the country\u2019s hardline clerical rulers, despite the public\u2019s calls for reforms. Overall voter turnout was 48.8% \u2013 the lowest since the establishment of the Islamic Republic. He took the presidency as negotiations with the United States over how to revive\u00a0the 2015 nuclear deal stalled, and as the country was in the throes of an economic crisis and under mounting pressure to reform. As President, Raisi is widely seen as a figure in which the Iranian\u00a0clerical\u00a0establishment has heavily invested \u2013 and even as a potential successor to the 85-year-old Khamenei. Many believe he has been groomed to be elevated to the Supreme Leadership. A year into his presidency, he brutally quashed a youth-led uprising over repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab, and continued to stamp out dissent in its aftermath. As recently as this month, a dissident rapper was handed\u00a0a death sentence in releation to the 2022 protests. A United Nations report found that Iran\u2019s \u201crepression of peaceful protests\u201d and \u201cinstitutional discrimination against women and girls\u201d has led to human rights violations, some of which amount to \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d In foreign policy, Raisi notably presided over the strongest Iran-backed show of force against Israel in nearly two decades. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October, Tehran-supported armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen have continuously attacked Israel and its allies in the region. He also spurned negotiations with the US over Iran\u2019s nuclear program, dealing a devastating blow to stalled talks with the Biden administration that aimed to revive the Obama-era deal of sanctions relief in exchange for curbs to the country\u2019s uranium enrichment program. That deal was upended by Trump in 2018, when the former president unleashed waves of sanctions on Iran despite Tehran ostensibly sticking to its end of the bargain. Shortly after, the country\u00a0announced\u00a0its intention to enrich uranium up to 60% purity, pushing the country closer to reaching the 90% enrichment level that is considered weapons-grade. In March 2023, uranium particles enriched to near bomb-grade levels were found at an Iranian nuclear facility, according to the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog,\u00a0as the US warned\u00a0that Tehran\u2019s ability to build a nuclear bomb was accelerating. As he turned his back to Washington, Raisi sought to end his country\u2019s economic isolation by looking elsewhere, strengthening Tehran\u2019s relationship with China, and repairing diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Gulf Arab powerhouses which were long considered Tehran\u2019s arch-foes. Iran\u2019s economy has begun to rebound over the past two years, according to the World Bank.

{"id": "2024_04_16_style_emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest", "text": "While many celebrity homes look less than lived-in, ranging from spotless minimal to ostentatiously palatial, actor Emma Roberts\u2019 Hollywood Hills home is made for curling up with a good book \u2014 or several \u2014 with warm tones, comfortable couches, and antique curiosities in each room (also, a lagoon-style pool in the backyard for summer reads). Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_georgia-foreign-agents-law-explained-intl", "text": "Georgia\u2019s parliament passed a highly controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that has triggered widespread protests across the former Soviet republic nestled in the Caucasus Mountains. Tens of thousands of people in capital city Tbilisi have been protesting the legislation. Critics warn that it mirrors a foreign agents law already passed in Russia and could jeopardize Georgia\u2019s bid to join the European Union. But Prime Minister\u00a0Irakli Kobakhidze succeeded and got it through the parliament on Tuesday, with 84 lawmakers voting in favor of the law and 30 against it in the 150-seat legislature. President Salome Zourabichvili has vowed to veto the law, but the parliament can easily override her. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the law and the uproar it has caused. What\u2019s in the law? The law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face crippling fines. The legislation was drafted by the Georgian Dream party, which along with its allies controls parliament. Zourabichvili called the bill \u201can exact duplicate\u201d of its Russian counterpart in an interview with CNN. What happens next? Zourabichvili has vowed to veto the bill, but that won\u2019t mean much. She now has two weeks to do so. But the Georgian parliament can override her objection with a simple majority. Georgia\u2019s government is a parliamentary system, so Zourabichvili is effectively a figurehead. Real power lies with Kobakhidze, the PM. Georgian Dream\u2019s billionaire founder, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, also wields significant political influence. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Zourabichvili said the upcoming elections in October will give the population a chance to \u201creverse\u201d the bill. \u201cWe have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections because that\u2019s the European way,\u201d she said. Why is it so controversial? A couple of reasons. The law is modeled after a similar one in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents law will be used to the same way it has been in its northern neighbor: to quash dissent and free expression by going after nongovernmental organizations with financial ties overseas. The law has had a devastating impact on non-profits and human rights groups in Russia, forcing many to cease their activities. Georgian Dream contends the legislation will promote transparency and national sovereignty and has hit back at Western criticism over the proposal. But the law\u2019s possible passage has touched on a more existential question: whether Georgia\u2019s future lies with Europe or Russia. Georgia has, like Ukraine, been caught between the two geopolitical forces since achieving independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Many Georgians feel deep hostility toward the Kremlin, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory \u2013 about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine. Georgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that Ivanishvili made his fortune in the Soviet Union. How do most Georgians feel about it? Passionately. So much so that lawmakers at one point came to blows over the bill. Polling shows that about 80% of Georgians support joining the European Union rather than drifting further into the Kremlin\u2019s orbit, and many of those in favor of deepening ties with the West have taken to the streets. Mass demonstrations against the bill in Tbilisi had been going on nightly for a month before its passing. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the capital, which is home to about 1 million people, to speak out against what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cthe Russian law.\u201d There have been counter-protests as well. One saw the usually reclusive Ivanishvili deliver a rare speech to a crowd of supporters bussed in to Tbilisi from Georgia\u2019s rural regions, where Georgian Dream enjoys more support. The address showed deep paranoia and an autocratic streak. Ivanishvili claimed that Georgia was being controlled by \u201ca pseudo-elite nurtured by a foreign country\u201d and pledged to go after his political opponents after October\u2019s elections. Didn\u2019t Georgia already go through this? Yes, just last year. Georgia\u2019s government tried to pass the same law but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense\u00a0protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water cannons. The bill was reintroduced in March, about a month after Kobakhidze became Prime Minister. This time, authorities seem determined to push the legislation through. What have other countries said? White House national security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan wrote on X that Washington is \u201cdeeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in\u00a0Georgia.\u201d \u201cGeorgian parliamentarians face a critical choice \u2013 whether to support the\u00a0Georgian people\u2019s Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents\u2019 law that runs counter to democratic values,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stand with the\u00a0Georgian people.\u201d The Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to \u201cprovoke anti-Russian sentiments,\u201d adding that protests against it were being stirred by \u201coutside\u201d influences. \u201cThis is now the normal practice of a huge number of states that are doing everything to protect themselves from outside influence, from foreign influence on domestic politics. And all countries are taking action in one form or another, but all these bills have the same goal,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in April. \u201cOnce again, there is no way to link this bill and the desire to secure Georgia\u2019s internal politics with some kind of Russian influence; this is not the case.\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement earlier this month that she was following the developments in George with \u201cgreat concern\u201d and reiterated Brussels\u2019 unease over the law. \u201cGeorgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,\u201d she said. Could the law impact Georgia\u2019s ability to join the EU? Definitely. Georgia first applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, an important but still early step in the process of becoming a member of the bloc. However, Brussels said last month that the law\u2019s passage would \u201cnegatively impact\u201d Georgia\u2019s path to EU membership \u201cGeorgia has a vibrant civil society that contributes to the country\u2019s successful progress towards EU membership. The proposed legislation would limit the capacity of civil society and media organizations to operate freely, could limit freedom of expression and unfairly stigmatize organizations that deliver benefits to the citizens of Georgia,\u201d EU officials said. \u201cThe EU urges Georgia to refrain from adopting legislation that can compromise Georgia\u2019s EU path, a path supported by the overwhelming majority of Georgian citizens.\u201d CNN\u2019s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/georgia-foreign-agents-law-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

The annual Space-out competition, held on Sunday, finds who\u2019s best at zoning out for 90 minutes without falling asleep, checking their phone or talking. Participants\u2019 heart rates are monitored, while onlookers vote for their 10 favorite contestants. Whoever has the most stable heart rate among the 10 takes home the trophy. Among those taking part was speed skater Kwak Yoon-gy, a double Olympic silver medalist. \u201cI tried out for the Olympics five times and have never taken a proper rest while training for 30 years,\u201d said the 34-year-old short-track specialist, who took third place. \u201cI heard this place is where I can clear my mind and rest at least during this time, so I came here thinking, \u2018Wow, this is what I needed so much.\u2019\u201d More than 4,000 people applied to participate in the competition, hosted by the city government. The 117 contestants selected ranged from a child in second grade to people in their 60s. For many participants, it was a way to recover from burnout and stress, often from their work, in a country with high academic stress and extreme pressure to succeed. \u201cI usually had a lot of worries and stress, so I applied [to participate] because I thought it would be nice to blow away such stress and worries by spacing out in the competition,\u201d said 26-year-old YouTuber Kim Seok-hwan. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Space-out competition, founded by a visual artist, who goes by the pseudonym Woopsyang, after she suffered severe burnout.  \u201cI wondered why I was so anxious about doing nothing,\u201d she recalled, adding that that\u2019s when she realized her anxiety came from comparing herself to other people leading busy lives. \u201cIn fact, those people could also be wanting to space out and do nothing like me,\u201d Woopsyang said. \u201cSo, I created a competition thinking that it would be nice to pause all together at the same place at the same time.\u201d Competitive idling \u201coverturns the social convention that spacing out is a waste of time in today\u2019s busy society and turns it into a valuable activity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis contest tells you that spacing out is no longer a waste of time but a time that you really need.\u201d The competition is also performance art, she said. \u201cAlthough the contestants are staying still inside the competition venue, the audience is constantly moving around,\u201d Woopsyang said, adding her goal was to \u201ccreate a visual contrast between a group that does nothing and a group that is busy.\u201d Since the first Space-out competition was held in Seoul in 2014, it has expanded internationally, with contests taking place in various cities such as Beijing, Rotterdam, Taipei, Hong Kong and Tokyo. This year\u2019s competition in Seoul was won by freelance announcer Kwon So-a, who works multiple jobs, and took home a trophy shaped like the Auguste Rodin sculpture \u201cThe Thinker.\u201d \u201cEspecially here in Korea, it\u2019s such a competitive country, where people think that if they do nothing that they are a little behind,\u201d Kwon, 35, said. \u201cI think everyone has to have their own pace and sometimes just slow down.\u201d Doing nothing is \u201cgood for your mental health as well as your physical health because your body has to relax, but your body can only relax when your brain relaxes,\u201d she added. \u201cFor both of these reasons, people should space out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/asia/south-korea-space-out-competition-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Millions in the region must remain weather aware Monday and Tuesday after powerful storms battered parts of the region Sunday with damaging tornadoes, baseball-sized hail and winds up to 100 mph. At least 13 tornadoes were reported across Kansas, Colorado and Oklahoma on Sunday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Two tornadoes struck Oklahoma, one of which triggered a rare tornado emergency in Custer City and damaged 10 to 15 homes in Custer County and another hit the western portions of Oklahoma City. Two people were injured in Blaine County, Oklahoma, when their mobile home was destroyed and a local nursing home also reported damage, according to state and county officials. Custer County also reported two people with injuries, the state emergency management office said. Wind gusts as strong as 100 mph and baseball-sized hail knocked out power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Kansas Sunday night. More than 30,000 homes and businesses remained without power Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. Significant storm damage in Harvey County, Kansas \u2013 about 25 miles north of Wichita \u2013 prompted a local disaster declaration, the county said on X Sunday night. Additional dangerous storms Monday, Tuesday Severe thunderstorms will bubble to life later Monday afternoon or early Monday evening in parts of Colorado and Wyoming and track east through the night to impact Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota. Any storm could deliver damaging winds, hail and even a tornado. Some of the strongest storms could fire up in parts of northeastern Colorado and western Nebraska where a Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Though not directly in the storm\u2019s bullseye, cities including Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Minneapolis and St. Louis are also at risk of severe weather. Severe thunderstorm risks will expand Tuesday across a large portion of the central US from Texas to the Midwest and Great Lakes. More than 16 million people in the Midwest are under a Level 3 of 5 or greater risk of severe thunderstorms Tuesday. Tuesday\u2019s storms could produce a significant swath of damaging wind gusts, along with large hail and EF2 or stronger tornadoes. Widespread, \u201cintense\u201d damaging wind gusts are most likely late Tuesday within the Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms area including southern Iowa and northwestern Illinois, according to the SPC.

{"id": "2024_05_14_europe_prison-ambush-france-intl", "text": "French authorities launched a manhunt on Tuesday after gunmen ambushed a prison convoy in Normandy to break out an inmate, killing two guards and wounding three others. The violent incident, extremely rare for that part of northern France, took place as the vehicle was transporting a prisoner from court to a nearby prison, French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said. Video from the scene showed a black SUV in flames that appeared to have crashed into a prison van near a motorway toll booth, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.\u00a0Two hooded individuals could be seen carrying what appeared to be long rifles. Dupond-Moretti told reporters that the incident was the first time a French prison employee had died while working since 1992. He added that one of the guards leaves behind a wife and two children, and the other a spouse who was five months\u2019 pregnant. Dupond-Moretti added that two of those hurt sustained life-threatening injuries. The gunmen are still at large, national police said on X. \u201cEverything, and I mean everything, will be done to find the perpetrators of this heinous crime. These are people for whom life means nothing. They will be arrested. They will be tried. And they will be punished for the crime they committed,\u201d Dupond-Moretti said. A manhunt is underway to find suspects who carried out the prison break and the inmate, a 30-year-old who had been convicted of burglary and is being investigated for a kidnapping related to death, according to the French national prosecutor in charge of organized crime, which has already opened an investigation into the incident. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on X he has mobilized the national gendarmerie and \u201cseveral hundred\u201d police officers for the manhunt.\u00a0Authorities on the scene are setting up roadblocks and establishing a perimeter, BFMTV reported. Vehicles found On Tuesday evening local time, French police said they had discovered two burnt out vehicles used by the attackers. Paris state prosecutor Laure Beccuau told a press conference that the two vehicles were found in Houtteville and in Gauville-le-Campagne, two towns in the d\u00e9partement of Eure where the attack took place near the Incarville tollbooth shortly before 11am local time (5aET). One of the vehicles, a Peugeot, had been used to ram the police van during the attack, Becuau said. The other vehicle, an Audi, had been following the van and carried the two gunmen. Forensic experts have been carrying out \u201cmeticulous tests\u201d at the scene of the crime, and police had been studying video of the attack filmed by eyewitnesses and posted on social media, Beccuau told the press conference. The prosecutor also revealed more details about the escaped inmate, identifying him as Mohamed Amra, and saying he is \u201cvery well known to the justice system,\u201d having sustained a total 13 convictions. Most of those convictions related to incidences of theft with aggravated offences, Beccuau said, adding that Amra had been incarcerated in various facilities since January 2022. A minimum of three police officers had been decided as the security level for the escort several weeks ago, Beccuau told journalists. In the end, five officers were involved in the escort. A 52-year-old officer and 34-year-old officer were both killed during the attack whilst their colleagues, a 48-year-old, a 52-year-old and a 55-year-old were all injured, she said. On May 10, Amra was found guilty on the charge of burglary by a court in \u00c9vreux and was also under investigation in Marseille for a kidnap which led to a death, Beccuau said. The prosecutor said the authorities\u2019 priority now is getting to the bottom of this \u201coutburst of violence.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said on X that \u201cevery effort is being made to find the perpetrators of this crime so that justice can be done in the name of the French people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/europe/prison-ambush-france-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Hagari did not say when or where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recovered the video, which shows the since-freed child, Ela Elyakim, speaking to the camera asking to be released. The IDF also released a photo showing Ela with her sister Dafna Elyakim by her side in front of a flag with the Hamas logo. The sisters were kidnapped from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during Hamas\u2019\u00a0October 7 attack on Israel and were\u00a0released\u00a0on November 26 as part of the temporary truce. The family of the sisters approved the IDF publishing the video, Hagari said. CNN has decided not to air the video but to show the still image of the two sisters. \u201cEla\u2019s family asked us to share it with the world to expose Hamas\u2019s terror, to expose Hamas\u2019s cruelty, to expose Hamas\u2019s barbarism,\u201d Hagari said, \u201cPlease help us respect the wishes of Ela\u2019s family by sharing this video far and wide.\u201d In the video, Ela says in Hebrew: \u201cMy name is Ela Elyakim, daughter of Noam and I am eight years old, and I am asking to release us and I am a hostage of Hamas\u201d \u201cEight-year-old Ela Elyakim told us that Hamas terrorists forced her to read from a script, forced her to change her clothes, and forced her to re-film this terrifying scene over and over and over again,\u201d Hagari said. Around 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas\u2019 surprise October 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. In the seven months since that time, Israel has launched a war in Gaza that has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. More than 100 hostages were freed during a release deal in November, but the IDF believes there are still 132 hostages in Gaza, 128 of whom were taken on October 7. Of those 132 hostages, 40 are believed to be dead, including two who were taken in 2014, the IDF believes. The video\u2019s release comes as political divisions are deepening in Israel over the\u00a0trajectory and priorities of the war, which has sparked a humanitarian crisis that deepens by the day. War cabinet member and former Israeli defense minister Benny Gantz on Saturday threatened to withdraw his party from the coalition government if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn\u2019t change tact. Gantz demanded that the cabinet adopt a plan to secure the return of Israeli hostages, the demobilization of Hamas and the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip by June 8. Netanyahu\u2019s office criticized Gantz\u2019s conditions \u2013 bringing fissures in the government into the spotlight.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end.

Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez described the Spanish shooting victims as tourists, in a post on X. \u201cOverwhelmed by the news of the murder of Spanish tourists in Afghanistan. I am closely following the situation. The Emergency Consular Unit of the Spanish Foreign Ministry is working to offer all necessary assistance. I want to convey all my sympathy to their family and friends,\u201d the prime minister posted. Prosecutors from Spain\u2019s National Court in Madrid, which handles cases of terrorism, have opened an investigation into the shooting in Afghanistan for potential links to terrorism, the prosecution service said in a statement on Saturday. The statement added that the Spanish fatalities were a man and two women from northeastern Spain \u2013 one from Barcelona, another from Girona and the third from Figueres. Qani also expressed condolences for the deaths, saying, \u201cThe Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan strongly condemns this crime, expresses its deep feelings to the families of the victims and assures that all the criminals will be found and punished.\u201d Asked to comment on reports that an Australian national is among those injured, Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Saturday that it was \u201cproviding consular assistance\u201d to one of its citizens in Afghanistan following the deadly attack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/asia/afghanistan-spanish-killed-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_climate_brazil-floods-social-problems-intl", "text": "Karine Pitana had just paid off the last installment on her new couch when floods tore through her hometown of Canoas in southern Brazil nearly two weeks ago. It was just a piece of furniture, but for the 42-year-old nurse, there\u2019s a pride in having worked hard for everything she owns. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard, you work, you buy things with such love,\u201d she told CNN, sobbing, from her brother\u2019s home, where she\u2019s now staying. She worries about all the precious things she might lose. \u201cAll the priceless mementos, my childhood photos, my daughter\u2019s photos,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d The picture is a little different in Porto Alegre, the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul. It oozes a rich colonial history in its grand architecture and a sense of luxury in its large marinas. Landing pads for private helicopters are not an uncommon site. Weeks of deadly floods triggered by record-smashing rainfall have left parts of southern Brazil in disaster, also laying bare some of the country\u2019s persistent social problems: inequality in the emerging economy is still rife; crime rates remain high; and local governance is often dogged by mismanagement and, sometimes, corruption. There is stark inequality between the country\u2019s north and its more affluent south. But even in Rio Grande do Sul, one of the wealthiest of Brazil\u2019s states, affluent parts of Porto Alegre stand in sharp contrast with the rundown towns on its periphery, like Canoas. Nearly three weeks after the first rains hit southern Brazil, water levels are still too high for Pitana to return home. With the waters receding very slowly, Pitana is now stuck with her brother and his family in a neighborhood on higher ground. She\u2019s also unable to commute to work, despite hospitals desperately needing nurses like her. \u201cI try to move around, my brother and my sister-in-law take me to the shelters, me and my daughter, and we end up helping some of the people there,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in me staying at home, with my hands tied. \u2026 It also keeps our minds busy, when we\u2019re helping others.\u201d Ironically, the name Canoas comes from the Portuguese word for \u201ccanoes,\u201d but that didn\u2019t spare the city from the worst of the floods \u2014 it was, in fact, one of the hardest hit. Pitana is considered lucky to have relatives to turn to. Around a quarter of Brazilians housed in temporary shelters come from Canoas, according to state government data. Porto Alegre\u2019s population is four times larger than Canoas\u2019, but fewer than a fifth of those in temporary accommodations are from the capital. Many \u2018ga\u00fachos\u2019 \u2014 as the people of Rio Grande do Sul are known \u2014 can fall back on second homes away from the city. These inequalities remain in Brazil, despite economic growth that, over the first two decades of this century, lifted millions of people out of poverty. The number of people living in extreme deprivation has been reduced from around 15% in 2001 to under 6% of the population in 2022. And just before the Covid-19 pandemic, it had fallen to its lowest level since 1980. Yet income inequality has remained stubbornly high. Since the early 1990s, the gap between the richest and poorest Brazilians has narrowed, but not by much, and Brazil remains the world\u2019s eighth-most unequal country, World Bank data shows. It ranks second-last for equality of all Latin American nations, ahead only of Suriname. That problem also feeds Brazil\u2019s issues with crime. As the floods came into the glitzy state capital, so too did criminals ready to loot. In the past couple of weeks, Brazilian authorities have arrested 97 people for crimes linked to the floods, mostly for theft of items, including jet skis, and looting, the Rio Grande do Sul Public Safety department told CNN. Of those, 34 were arrested inside temporary shelters. Reports of sexual abuse inside some of the shelters also led to at least six arrests, according to authorities, forcing the local government to set up women- and- children- only shelters. Police and military officers were also given special training to provide adequate security inside the shelters. In Rio Grande do Sul, crime rates are below the national average and violent crime has been on a downward trajectory, reaching a historical low in 2023, although drug trafficking and theft are still problems. Brazil as a whole, however, is still one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Even though homicide rates have fallen, it still has the most in the world, with more than 45,000 cases, UN data shows. Lula\u2019s Hurricane Katrina moment Rio Grande do Sul was hit with so much rain over so long, authorities are saying it could be weeks until the floodwaters recede, especially if more rain falls. More than 30 inches of rain (750 mm) fell on parts of the state in two and a half weeks from the end of April. That\u2019s just a few inches shy of what a city like Chicago or Dallas typically records in an entire year. That rain and flooding have led to more than 150 deaths, and weeks on, 500,000 people remain displaced. It\u2019s the kind of extreme weather event that\u2019s only going to become more frequent and intense as the climate crisis bears down, science shows. A massive operation to get the state back on its feet is underway, with President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva disbursing an eye-watering $10 billion for the region to help it rebuild. But anger is growing over how slowly the help came initially, as residents complain of inadequate spending on infrastructure that could have made this disaster less destructive. They are bracing for weeks of more disruption as floodwaters just won\u2019t go away. The outdated dikes built decades ago to keep rivers and lakes from overflowing, are now, ironically, trapping the water in, keeping much of the state, including Canoas, inundated. \u201cThe water came into this side of the barriers, now it\u2019ll take a long time, maybe 45, 60 days to take it to the other side,\u201d Canoas Mayor Jairo Jorge da Silva said in an interview with Brazilian broadcaster Globo last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ourselves a big pool.\u201d \u201cThe barriers, they end up preventing water flow in the opposite direction, the draining of the city,\u201d said Pedro Cort\u00eas, an Environmental Science professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThey may not have thought about a drainage system in the case the barriers were not enough,\u201d said Cort\u00eas, who is also a climate analyst for CNN Brasil, a CNN affiliate. It may not be quite the same scale, but some observers are saying the floods are Lula\u2019s Hurricane Katrina moment. Cort\u00eas says the combination of a lack of funding, planning and the unprecedented situation meant authorities were caught off guard. \u201cUnfortunately, investment in mitigation of the impacts of climate change and in tackling emergencies have been well below what is needed,\u201d Cort\u00eas said. \u201cThe state of Rio Grande do Sul wasn\u2019t prepared for this kind of tragedy \u2014 it was obviously an exceptional volume of water, but the state didn\u2019t have an adequate strategy to deal with it.\u201d And the government has had plenty of time to prepare. Research by Brazilian fact-checking website Lupa showed that 90% of all the areas affected by the devastating rain had experienced at least one flood or heavy rain-related emergency situation in the past decade. Despite the warning signs, investment in flood prevention systems by Porto Alegre actually went down from 2021 to 2022, and did not even feature in the yearly budget in 2023. At the state level, funding for disaster response represents only 0.2% of the budget for 2024, despite numerous emergencies the previous year. \u201cFloods, not with this volume but with considerable volumes of water, have taken place in Porto Alegre in the last few years,\u201d Cort\u00eas explains. \u201cThis was a completely unusual situation, a record situation, but unfortunately, because of what we know about climate change, it could repeat itself in the next few years unfortunately.\u201d Left to swim for survival In\u00a0the absence of professional help at the onset of the floods, volunteers had to take matters in their own hands. One volunteer was Fabiano Saldanha, a 48-year-old businessman from Porto Alegre, who used his jet ski to rescue people trapped in their homes. \u201cIt was mostly the population, us volunteers, that were rescuing people,\u201d Saldanha says. \u201cIt was the people helping the people.\u201d He banded with other volunteers and coordinated teams on jet skis and small boats, navigating through narrow and debris-cluttered lanes to reach some of those trapped. Saldanha says he spent 10 days without seeing his family. \u201cOne thing I kept repeating was, \u2018No-one will be left behind,\u2019\u201d he recalled. He also said he believed authorities struggled to deal with the disaster in the first few days. \u201cThey wanted to do it \u2014 the fire department, Civil Defense, the police \u2014 but I think it was all a bit bureaucratic,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI think they were lacking a bit of logistics and organization.\u201d Even when authorities were organized and ordered evacuations, some people chose not to listen, believing the water wouldn\u2019t reach them. \u201cOne of those people was me,\u201d Pitana admitted. \u201cMy mother, my father and my daughter evacuated beforehand, and they asked me to go with them, but I told them I was going to stay.\u201d Overnight, her home began to flood, first through the bathroom drains. Within an hour, the water was up to her knees. Then up to her waist. \u201cThat\u2019s when we started to panic, it was very fast,\u201d she said, referring to herself and her husband. \u201cWe strapped some of the furniture, closed some doors and then we left \u2014 outside the water was higher, already up to our chest.\u201d She shared with CNN a photo of her in the chest-high floods, clinging onto her pet terrier with a packed suitcase and bag hanging on her fence to keep dry, just before she was forced to flee. Pitana was rescued by two young men who helped her and an elderly neighbour onto their rowboat \u2014 but it was too small to fit her husband as well. \u201cThey had a vest in the boat and gave it to him, he put it on so he could swim along,\u201d she said. \u201c[The current] was very strong and the water was very deep already, maybe more than 2 meters I think.\u201d Pitana says she cried for help, but emergency services were nowhere to be found. Thousands of people in the area have stories like Pitana\u2019s. As Lula touched down in Canoas on Wednesday, for his third visit to the flood-hit areas, he tried to quell the discontent, telling reporters, \u201cEveryone who lost their house, will have their home.\u201d He later announced a support package to help around 200,000 of those impacted by the floods totalling just over $200 million. In addition to the $10 billion pledged to rebuild the state, Brazil is seeking more support from international institutions, like the IMF and World Bank. Cort\u00eas says that both state and federal governments need to resist the urge to build quick and fast, and, rather, plan more thoughtfully for the future and its changing climate. \u201cThe tendency is to try and rebuild what you lost. If you do that, cities will only be as resilient as they were before, and that is not enough,\u201d he explained, calling for a deep risk analysis. \u201cAny attempt to rebuild will need to think about preparing cities to be able to withstand these extreme weather events.\u201d Pitana can\u2019t quite think about life in the future, she\u2019s just focusing on the present, finding her new reality all-consuming. But she hopes authorities will do\u00a0what they can to prevent this kind of disaster happening again. \u201cI think given the severity of this situation, they will do something \u2014 they have to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to think about it, but this will happen again.\u201d CNN\u2019s Mary Gilbert contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/climate/brazil-floods-social-problems-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

However, during that \u201clife-changing\u201d semester in the south of France, she gained an appreciation for French culture that \u201copened my eyes in a way that changed my life.\u201d \u201cIn the United States, especially at that time, you would meet someone for coffee, and they will be there, but they will be looking almost past you,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause they will be thinking of their next appointment or their next engagement. \u201cAnd in France, you will go have a coffee and it was just like the world stopped for hours.\u201d On returning to the US, Regan signed up for an international MBA program that would allow her to spend an entire year in France. Once she graduated, Regan was offered an internship at a company based in Paris in 2002, providing her with the opportunity to live in the French capital. \u201cI thought that that was incredible,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it would be an opportunity that would be silly to pass by.\u201d As she settled into life in Paris, Regan was mesmerized by its vibrant culture, particularly the city\u2019s restaurants and museums, and \u201cjust how much fun you could have\u201d there. She says that she initially anticipated living and working in the European city for a year or two. However, when Regan fell for a Frenchman named Julien, who she married in 2007, her fate was seemingly sealed. \u201cI had already been in Paris for three years,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo I was definitely enjoying my life. And at that point, I had a group of friends. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t even like I met him and it changed everything. But he became a major component of me no longer seeking to possibly go back to the States.\u201d Quality of life She and her husband went on to have two sons, Theodore and Jefferson. Regan was hugely impressed by the care she received during childbirth, explaining that new mothers in the country commonly stay in hospital for a few days. She feels blessed to have been able to raise her children in France due to the \u201cwonderful quality of life,\u201d stressing that although she works \u201cvery hard,\u201d she\u2019s at home for dinner with her family every night. \u201cWe have school vacation every six weeks,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo every six weeks, the kids are off from school for two or three weeks. \u201cAnd in that time, it is culturally accepted that you take vacation. It\u2019s normal.\u201d She goes on to explain that she feels as though her children are safer in France than they would be in the US as \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same issues with guns.\u201d \u201cFrom the age of 10 or 11, they [kids] start going to school by themselves,\u201d adds Regan. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just a cultural norm. \u201cSo as a parent of relatively young children, just the quality of life is just so much better.\u201d Regan has also found France to be more affordable for her family, despite Paris being ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in. She credits this, at least partly, to the French healthcare system, which provides universal coverage for all legal residents. \u201cYou have the social system, and then you have private health care provided by companies,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have that same level of stress.\u201d Regan recently spent around five weeks in the US and she admits to being stunned by how much prices had increased. International city \u201cI was really shocked by the price increase in inflation of groceries, for example,\u201d she says. \u201cOver here [in Paris,] we\u2019ve had a price increase in inflation, but not as dramatic.\u201d While Regan has now lived in Paris for over two decades, she admits that it was a long while before she felt completely at home in the city. \u201cI would say it took me two years to really love my current life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt probably took me eight years to really feel like this was home. \u201cAnd now I can\u2019t imagine a different place that I would want to live my life.\u201d Over the years, Regan has seen Paris go through many changes, and feels that the city has become \u201ceven more international\u201d with \u201cmore and more foreigners.\u201d \u201cTwenty years ago, you would really struggle to have a life here, if you didn\u2019t speak French,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd now that has changed.\u201d Although she\u2019d taken a few months of intensive French language courses before arriving in France, Regan concedes that it was a while before she felt like a relatively competent French speaker. She recalls how she struggled at big dinner parties as she would often be the only English speaker. However, she feels that this wouldn\u2019t be the case now, as there are far more people in the city who speak other languages. \u201cI think it\u2019s become much, much easier [to relocate to Paris],\u201d she says. Regan initially came to France on a student visa, before obtaining a working visa. After marrying a French national, she was eligible for a French residence permit, or a Carte de Sejour, which she renews every 10 years. She is currently eligible for French citizenship, but is yet to begin the process. \u201cIt\u2019s a large administrative task,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I feel like every single year, I\u2019ve had another priority.\u201d Regan now runs a Paris-based real estate agency, which provides property services to international clients. \u201cI guess the thing I\u2019m very proud of is that we really help people,\u201d she says, explaining that many newcomers struggle with the \u201cslower administrative process\u201d in France, and want advice on pinpointing \u201cwhich neighborhoods are the most safe and adapted for foreigners.\u201d She tends to advise those interested in relocating to Paris to do as much research as they can before coming over and to get any documents they might need ready well ahead of time. The \u2018Emily\u2019 effect? Netflix series \u201cEmily in Paris,\u201d which centers around an American marketing executive who moves to Paris for a new job, has put the city back in the spotlight in recent years, with many fans of the show flocking to the French capital to try to recreate some of the experiences portrayed. While Regan notes that the show has likely helped to attract newcomers, she stresses that \u201cParis has always been top of the list.\u201d \u201cI was a young twenty-something 25 years ago, and it was my dream to come, even before \u2018Emily in Paris,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s probably opened that up to a larger audience that maybe didn\u2019t necessarily have the opportunity to travel internationally previously.\u201d Regan regularly returns to the US to visit her family and says she relishes the opportunity to dress more casually, as \u201crolling out of bed in sweats, putting on a hat\u201d and going about your day is somewhat frowned upon in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a little bit more formal over here,\u201d she says, noting that while most of her Parisian friends get their hair and nails done before going on vacation, she does \u201cthe opposite\u201d when going back to the US. \u201cI take off my nail polish. I don\u2019t do any makeup. It\u2019s a little bit more relaxed.\u201d While she still has strong connections to America, Regan can\u2019t imagine herself ever returning and feels as though she ended up where she was meant to be. \u201cI definitely see myself where I am,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a huge amount of faith that things work out the way they\u2019re always supposed to. \u201cThese past 25 years have been just wild. It\u2019s been incredible, with ups and downs\u2026\u00a0 I personally have just been very blessed.\u201d When asked if she considers herself a Parisian now, Regan says she\u2019s not sure whether that\u2019s something she can \u201cself declare,\u201d but she feels close to being a Parisian \u201cby adoption.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/us-woman-traveled-to-paris-ended-up-staying-for-good/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
