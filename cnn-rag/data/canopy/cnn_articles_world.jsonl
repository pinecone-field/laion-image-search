{"id": "2024_07_13_europe_paris-olympics-sex-education-pleasure-spt-intl", "text": "The City of Love has a message as it prepares for the Olympics: Performance is not always the priority. Rather, when it comes to sex, pleasure takes first place. As Paris starts welcoming athletes to the Olympic Village in the coming days, organizers of the 2024 Games are set to launch a comprehensive sexual health campaign that champions pleasure and consent as well as the traditional emphasis on safety. It is an important message, backed by research, that is rarely endorsed on a stage with a global spotlight as influential as the Olympics. Prioritizing pleasure in sexual health refers to the approach of celebrating the physical and mental benefits of sexual experiences as well as minimizing the risks. It aims to rewrite fear and shame narratives that cast sex as taboo, with sexual health organizations promoting the sex-positive method as fundamental for unlocking greater agency over sexual rights and well-being. A systematic review by the World Health Organization and advocacy group The Pleasure Project found that pleasure-inclusive sex education is a more effective sexual health intervention strategy than abstinence programs and risk-focused messaging. The findings show that it increases condom usage and enhances knowledge and self-esteem, which are crucial to promoting safer choices in the bedroom. The decision to focus on pleasure-inclusive messaging at the Olympics is especially significant at a time when sex education is increasingly under attack in many countries. In the United States alone, 2024 has seen a surge in restrictive state-level sex education proposals that aim to limit what can be taught in the classroom, such as by removing guidance around contraception or advocating for abstinence. History of Sex Ed at the Olympics Paris\u2019s focus on pleasure and consent is part of the Olympics\u2019 long-running history of promoting safe sex, with organizers of the 1988 Seoul Games first making headline-grabbing hand-outs of condoms to competitors to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS. Since then, the International Olympic Committee has encouraged host cities to roll out condom initiatives at all summer and winter games, from a record-breaking 450,000 condoms at the 2016 Rio Olympics - equivalent to 42 per athlete - to keeping up the tradition at the 2022 Beijing Olympics despite COVID-19 social distancing rules. This year, organizers in charge of first aid announced that over 200,000 male condoms, 20,000 female condoms, and 10,000 dental dams would be made available at the Paris Olympic Village, which will host around 14,500 athletes. They will also have numerous sexual health testing centers on site for athletes, in addition to the sexual health awareness messaging. While one athlete - a gold medallist - once suggested sex was \u201c\u200b\u200bpart of the Olympic spirit \u2026 Why do you think they give away so many condoms?\u201d the massive number of condoms distributed is not just a reflection of the competitors\u2019 extra-athletic activities. Instead, the initiatives are intended to be used as a springboard for sex education. Anne Philpott is the founder of The Pleasure Project, an international organization that has spent the past two decades advocating for pleasure-inclusive sex education. She applauds Paris\u2019 decision to pair its condom initiative with pleasure and consent messaging. \u201cSo far the public health world has not done a good job of promoting safe sex,\u201d Philpott said, explaining that promoting condoms \u201cpurely for avoiding negative consequences,\u201d is not effective. Rather, she says the most productive way to encourage safe sex is to flip the script from the beginning by focusing on why people have sex. \u201cPeople think pleasure is a bit frivolous or the icing on the cake. But we now know that if we had integrated pleasure considerations into sexual health interventions from the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, we would have saved considerably more lives,\u201d Philpott explained. Philpott told CNN that the need to shift the narrative in safe sex conversations is as urgent as ever. She says if there is a failure to do so, people could instead shape their opinions from the misinformation and harmful explicit content running rampant online. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big rise in choking being seen as a normal part of sexual activity when it\u2019s actually very dangerous,\u201d Philpott gave as an example, as she urged sex education curriculums to catch up with what people are able to access online. Turning sport into a sex ed classroom The need to learn about one\u2019s sexual desires, needs, and boundaries is a constantly evolving process, with the Olympics\u2019 spotlight on safe sex also highlighting the opportunity for wider sporting communities to become trusted spaces for such conversations. In the coastal town of Kilifi in Kenya, Deogratia Okoko sees the value of expanding sex education beyond the classroom, using soccer to teach young boys about issues such as consent and contraception. The scheme to which he contributes, known as \u201cMoving The Goalposts,\u201d works directly with community leaders, fathers, and young boys to provide resources on sexual health, sexual rights, gender, and positive masculinity. \u201cWe found that one of the places that they spend a lot of their time is the football pitch,\u201d Okoko said. \u201cWe began to design our sessions based on soccer drills to explain certain issues,\u201d Okoko said, adding: \u201cYou\u2019ll find that sometimes they get so engrossed in the debrief discussions that they forget that they were supposed to actually train and play.\u201d Okoko explained that the initiative also provides a safe space for boys to access condoms and HIV testing kits, with societal shame often creating barriers for boys to buy these products directly from the shops. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just let\u2019s play football, let\u2019s practice and go away \u2026 these spaces are now a community used by them to talk about issues that they\u2019d not normally talk about,\u201d Okoko said. \u201cOne of the things that really came clearly to me was how using this strategy helped in mental health,\u201d Okoko told CNN. \u201cThey feel like they can talk about anything, if there\u2019s a challenge that they\u2019re going through, they come to the pitch.\u201d Reflecting on the Paris organizers\u2019 decision to include pleasure and consent in their sexual health messaging, Okoko says it is \u201cimperative\u201d to have high-profile platforms set the example. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental. It\u2019s important. It\u2019s good if we, to the best of our abilities, find great ways of passing that message across,\u201d Okoko said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/europe/paris-olympics-sex-education-pleasure-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_europe_russia-shadow-war-nato-intl-latam", "text": "Arson at warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine. Surveillance cameras where NATO trains Ukrainian troops. Blunt vandalism of ministerial cars. Even an apparent, failed bomb plot. Russia has been engaged in a \u201cbold\u201d sabotage operation across NATO\u2019s member states for\u00a0more than six\u00a0months, targeting the supply lines of weapons for Ukraine and the decision-makers behind it, according to a senior NATO official. Multiple security officials across Europe describe a threat that is metastasizing as Russian agents, increasingly under scrutiny by security services and\u00a0frustrated in their own operations, hire local amateurs to undertake high-risk, and often deniable, crimes on their behalf. The NATO official said they had observed \u201can unprecedented escalation and spread of Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare\u201d over the past six months, which included \u201cphysical sabotage\u201d on the supply line of NATO weapons intended for Ukraine. \u201cIt is everything from point of production and origin, to storage, to those who are making decisions, to the actual\u00a0delivery,\u201d the\u00a0senior NATO official said. \u201cIt is bold. Russia is attempting to intimidate\u00a0(our)\u00a0allies.\u201d Russia has dismissed the claims as unfounded but\u00a0Russian sabotage and hybrid warfare will be on the agenda of the NATO 75th anniversary meeting in Washington, DC,\u00a0which began Tuesday. Yet it is unclear how publicly member states will express their outrage at what analysts have called the Kremlin\u2019s new \u201cshadow\u00a0war,\u201d as they may be\u00a0reluctant to provide Moscow with a propaganda win, or foment alarm at a series of security breaches across Europe. Recent high-profile arrests have revealed the ad-hoc, clumsy nature of how the Kremlin\u2019s intelligence operations have evolved since the start of the war in\u00a0Ukraine. Last year, 14\u00a0Ukrainians and two Belarusians\u00a0were arrested in Poland in one case on suspicion of\u00a0working for Russian intelligence. A Ukrainian, who under Polish privacy law can be identified only as Maxim L., 24, was sentenced to\u00a0six\u00a0years\u00a0after weeks of receiving tasks from a Russian handler, Andrzej,\u00a0whom he had never physically met but encountered on the Telegram messaging app in February 2023. Andrzej at first paid him $7 in digital currencies for spraying anti-war graffiti around Poland, Maxim said. Yet the tasks soon became darker. \u2018Easy money\u2026 it seemed so insignificant\u2019 In a rare interview with CNN inside the maximum-security wing of Lublin prison, Maxim said he had fled Ukraine to Poland in a frustrated bid to escape\u00a0unemployment and poverty. \u201cIt was easy\u00a0money,\u201d he\u00a0said of the work Andrzej offered. \u201cI needed money badly.\u201d He said he did not feel an obligation to fight for Ukraine after the Russian invasion\u00a0in\u00a0February 2022. \u201cThat country has never done anything for\u00a0me,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that just because you are born in a certain country, you have to go to war for it. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I am not pro-Russian, I am not pro-Ukraine. I am not pro-anything.\u201d Andrzej soon started sending Maxim location pins where he should plant surveillance cameras along the railway tracks near the border town of Medyka, through which military and humanitarian aid would flow to Ukraine. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any of it could cause any actual harm. It seemed so insignificant,\u201d he\u00a0said. Andrzej later asked him to burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company in the eastern Polish town of Biala Podlaska, he said, which Maxim says he faked,\u00a0taking a photograph of the fence with lumps of coal he had placed to mimic fire damage. Yet Maxim\u2019s slow realization that Andrzej was a Russian agent became complete, he said, when he was told to put cameras outside a base where Poland was training Ukrainian soldiers. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew it could be\u00a0serious,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cIt made me feel uneasy. That was when I decided I\u2019d quit. But I never got a chance. I got arrested the\u00a0next day.\u201d Polish internal security agents arrested Maxim on March 3, 2023, after weeks of surveillance, sparked partially by the discovery of a gas station receipt Maxim had accidentally dropped on one of his operations,\u00a0according to a Polish official.\u00a0Multiple other arrests followed this, making it the largest\u00a0known\u00a0Russian espionage operation in Poland of recent times, raising concerns in Warsaw about the extent of Moscow\u2019s infiltration. Two Russian citizens were\u00a0detained\u00a0last August\u00a0on suspicion of\u00a0recruiting to Wagner\u00a0and a Polish\u00a0man and two Belarusians this May for\u00a0alleged\u00a0arson. Another Polish man was arrested in April 2024 for possessing ammunition, and surveilling Rzeszow Jasionka airport, a hub for moving NATO arms to Kyiv, in a suspected plot to assassinate Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also frequently uses the facility. The Polish plots join a series of incidents across Europe which, when viewed together,\u00a0portray\u00a0the widescale ambition of Moscow\u2019s operations.\u00a0Russia was \u201clikely\u201d behind an arson attack that hit Poland\u2019s largest shopping\u00a0center\u00a0in May, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, and suspicions have been voiced about another fire at an ammunition factory, south of the capital, in June. Czech officials have voiced concerns at Russian involvement in the hacking and disruption of its railways last year. Last month, a suspicious fire hit a metals factory for a defense manufacturer outside Berlin, and a\u00a026-year-old\u00a0pro-Russian\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0was arrested after blowing himself up with a\u00a0homemade\u00a0bomb near\u00a0Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.\u00a0A\u00a0warehouse\u00a0fire in East London in March led to\u00a0two men\u00a0being charged by London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service with arson and assisting a foreign intelligence service, namely Russia. While the incidents have not all been definitively linked to Russian intelligence, they have been unified by the apparent involvement of amateurs, or petty criminality aimed at spreading fear or disruption. A \u2018pretty dangerous game\u2019 The senior NATO official said Russian sabotage on NATO states amounted to a \u201cpretty dangerous game, if\u00a0(Russia believes)\u00a0these things are always below the threshold of armed conflict,\u201d that\u00a0would not trigger the NATO\u00a0Article 5\u00a0stipulation that an attack on one member state is an attack on the entire alliance. \u201cFinding where that line is, is a difficult and dangerous calculation to make,\u201d the official said, adding that\u00a0Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u2019s beleaguered invasion of Ukraine shows the Kremlin head was not always getting good military advice. Russia is using the \u201cfull gamut\u201d of hybrid operations, the official added. \u201cWe see everything from high-end operations in Europe, where we have seen as much as 400,000 euros ($433,000) paid for some type of intelligence activity, to some places where thugs are being hired for a couple of thousand\u00a0euros.\u201d A similar threat\u00a0has grown\u00a0on Russia\u2019s border with NATO, in Estonia, where 10\u00a0suspected Russian agents were arrested\u00a0in February after the interior minister\u2019s car was vandalized. The incident was a high-profile peak in what Estonian officials have said is a years-long campaign by Moscow to destabilize its tiny\u00a0NATO\u00a0neighbor, about a fifth\u00a0of whose population of 1.3 million is Russian-speaking,\u00a0according to a 2021 analysis by the EU. Recent months have seen GPS jamming impede civilian aircraft landings, and even the buoys that demark part of Russia\u2019s border with Estonia disappear, amid a short-lived call from Moscow for the maritime frontiers to be reassessed. Harrys Puusepp, a spokesman for the KAPO, Estonia\u2019s internal security service, told CNN that Russian activities had escalated over recent months. \u201cWe saw a significant rise in their activity in the last autumn, and by winter, we were able to apprehend more than\u00a010 (suspects).\u00a0The number has grown by now \u2013 persons who were involved in their hybrid activities against Estonian security \u2013 in a kind that we hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d He said the operations were moving \u201ctowards physical attacks\u201d and suggested the war in Ukraine might lead to more aggressive Russian tactics in the months ahead, if operatives were redeployed to the Baltic areas from the war. \u201cWe have to face the facts. Russia is big enough to have resources to fight a war against Ukraine and also maintain its security operations against European countries\u2026 against us. There are people who take part in the war against Ukraine, and then they are rotated to some other region or area. They have more experience. Their mindset is more violent. They are perhaps not so patient anymore trying to get results.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/europe/russia-shadow-war-nato-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_middleeast_gaza-israel-strikes-weekend-devastation-intl-hnk", "text": "Palestinians in Gaza are reeling from\u00a0a series of devastating\u00a0Israeli attacks that have renewed focus on the high number of civilian casualties\u00a0and widespread destruction caused by what Israel claims are targeted strikes against Hamas. Multiple United Nations officials have described harrowing scenes\u00a0in the crowded strip following large-scale Israeli strikes in recent days, including of child amputees unable to receive medical treatment after being bombed in so-called safe zones. Meanwhile, the UN chief said the devastation was \u201cincomprehensible and inexcusable\u201d and reiterated calls for the fighting to end. \u201cWe never lived in fear like this. There was blood everywhere,\u201d Gaza resident Ruwaida Issa told a CNN stringer at a school sheltering displaced people that was hit by a double Israeli missile strike on Sunday. \u201cWe were running looking for our children; remains of people were scattered all over the yard\u2026 We came here to shelter for nothing. There is no safety here. We want this war to stop; we can\u2019t bear this anymore.\u201d Israeli attacks across parts of Gaza killed at least 60 Palestinians on Tuesday \u2014 including a five-year-old child \u2014 according to local health officials, in the latest barrage of assaults. Since October 7, almost 70% of schools run by the UN\u2019s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza have been hit, the organization warned. More than nine months\u00a0of Israel\u2019s bombing campaign has turned once-lively neighborhoods into hollow wasteland, triggered mass displacement, crushed the health system and depleted critical supplies. \u201cYoung children were sitting here safely, each one sitting in his mother or father\u2019s lap,\u201d one eyewitness in Nuseirat, central Gaza, told CNN. \u201cSuddenly, missiles fell and tore them apart. Their remains flew on the walls and everywhere. There is no safety wherever you go.\u201d The Israeli military said early Tuesday it had struck about 40 \u201cterror targets.\u201d CNN cannot independent verify the IDF statements. Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed 38,713 Palestinians and injured another 89,166, according to the Ministry of Health there. Since Friday, Israel has launched waves of deadly missile strikes and attacks on what it called \u201cterrorist\u201d targets in central and southern Gaza as its military hunts down Hamas\u2019 leadership with the aid of US-made munitions. On Sunday, the Israeli military claimed to have targeted Hamas\u2019 military chief\u00a0and killed a Hamas brigade commander in an airstrike in Khan Younis.\u00a0It came as Israeli intelligence services said dozens of Hamas operatives involved in the October 7 attacks on Israel had been killed in the past week following \u201cintensified activity\u201d in Gaza. CNN cannot independent verify IDF statements. The human toll from Israel\u2019s weekend bombardment has been devastating. The strike targeting Hamas\u2019 military chief\u00a0hit a displacement camp in Al-Mawasi, which had been designated by the Israeli military as a safe zone for Palestinians fleeing the fighting elsewhere, killing at least 90 people and injuring 300, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. CNN has no way of verifying the casualty numbers reported by the ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants killed. Overwhelmed hospitals struggled to cope with the dead and wounded. One senior staffer at UNRWA, the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, described the Nasser hospital, which took in casualties of the strike, as \u201cthe most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.\u201d \u201cI saw toddlers who are double amputees, children paralyzed and unable to receive treatment, and others separated from their parents,\u201d said Scott\u00a0Anderson, director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza, in a\u00a0statement. \u201cParents told me in despair that they had moved into the \u2018so-called humanitarian zone\u2019 in the hope that their children would be safe there.\u201d The following day, at least 22 people were killed in a double Israeli missile strike that used US-made munitions on the Abu Oreiban school in the Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, where hundreds had taken refuge. The Israeli military claimed its air force struck the location where \u201ca number of terrorists\u201d\u00a0were operating. But Nuseirat residents told CNN mainly women, children and the elderly were sheltering at the school, which had been turned into a shelter run by UNRWA. \u201cWe are pulling a hand here and a leg there from under the rubble. Civilians who did nothing wrong,\u201d one man interviewed by a CNN stringer at the scene said. \u2018Where should we go?\u2019 Following the strikes on the school in Nuseirat, where thousands of displaced people are sheltering, families and UNRWA teams were helping to clean through the rubble. In the school yard, displaced families were hanging up their laundry but inside, crying women sat on the floor mourning their loved ones \u2014 torn clothes and rubble lay in piles in the yard. An injured woman and a girl in bandages cooked between the classrooms, while families and children stood in line for donated meals, carrying pots and plates and begging a man for some rice. \u201cWe are scared \u2026 My daughter was injured, my husband\u2019s children were all injured. The place we were sheltering in all collapsed on us,\u201d Mary Al Sammouna, a displaced woman from Gaza City, told a CNN stringer. \u201cThey are targeting everything; houses, human beings, stones, they didn\u2019t spare anything. But we are staying here even if we will die here. A person cannot leave his home twice; we have no other place to go to.\u201d Samir Tafesh, a displaced man from Gaza City, said those sheltering at the school are trying to get back to some kind of normalcy following the Israeli attack. \u201cWe are cleaning now, thank God we are still alive after the heavy bombardment, and we are trying to get back to normal life. We call for a ceasefire from both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are afraid that bombardments can happen again and again, but where should we go? We have no other place but this school; it is the safest for us,\u201d he added. Fresh pressure on negotiations The latest Israeli strikes have put new pressure on the success of ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations, which hit yet another roadblock last week. In a post on X Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres decried the violence in the strip and renewed calls for Israel and Hamas to agree a\u00a0long-touted deal for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. \u201cThe extreme level of fighting and devastation in Gaza is incomprehensible and inexcusable. Nowhere is safe. Everywhere is a potential killing zone,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cIt is high time for the parties to show the political courage and political will to finally reach a deal.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who has repeatedly vowed to eliminate Hamas \u2013 claimed the targeting of the group\u2019s military chief Mohammed Deif would improve the chances of a deal to free hostages, rather than harm them. \u201cHamas is weak. The more you hit it, the more you push for a deal,\u201d he told Israel\u2019s Channel 14 on Monday. It remains unclear if Deif died in Saturday\u2019s strike. The Israeli military is verifying whether he was killed while Netanyahu acknowledged it is uncertain whether he died.

{"id": "2024_07_15_style_ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian", "text": "India\u2019s most anticipated wedding of the year came to an end on Sunday after a star-studded three-day celebration that even saw the country\u2019s prime minister arrive to bless the young couple. Billionaire heir Anant Ambani married his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant in Mumbai in a lavish ceremony attended by Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, two former British prime ministers, Indian sporting legends and some of Bollywood\u2019s most famous faces. The wedding was followed by a blessing ceremony on Saturday, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi bestowed the young couple and their families with well wishes. The weekend\u2019s festivities concluded Sunday with an extravagant reception, or \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d (festival of bliss), as attendees jetted out of Mumbai. No expense was spared by the family that owns India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. The Ambani-owned 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Centre, which hosted wedding events throughout the weekend, was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, featuring floral installations and extravagant sets embellished with gold and silver. The couple underwent multiple outfit changes across the three-day bash, appearing in a succession of intricate, custom-made pieces celebrating the country\u2019s heritage and culture. Merchant\u2019s bridal ensemble was designed by Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and featured ivory zardozi (an elaborate type of metal embroidery) on silk and a 5-meter (16.4-foot) veil. She completed the look with jewels that aunts and sister wore to their own weddings. She later changed into an opulent red and gold outfit for her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family. Ambani meanwhile arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers. For the marriage ceremony, he wore a custom red sherwani by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, with a large green necklace draped around his neck. For Saturday\u2019s blessings ceremony, Merchant once again donned a custom piece by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, who collaborated with contemporary artist and sculptor Jayasri Burman to create a one-of-a-kind piece embroidered with real gold. The garment celebrates the couple\u2019s union \u201cthrough deeply meaningful imagery,\u201d Merchant\u2019s stylist Rhea Kapoor wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe human figures representing the happy couple radiate a celestial aura that honors the divinity in their humanity. The fauna depicts Anant\u2019s fondness for animals, particularly elephants that are considered auspicious and beautiful.\u201d For the reception Sunday, guests interpreted the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code by mixing classic Indian fashion with contemporary styles. Merchant wore a gold metallic corset from Dolce and Gabbana\u2019s Alta Moda couture line, along with a skirt and dupatta in the same shade by Indian designer Anamika Khanna. Months of planning It is not known precisely how much the Ambanis spent on the celebrations, which included months of pre-wedding parties, though industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Insiders worked for months to bring the couple\u2019s vision to life, collaborating with the family to bring the intricate details \u2014 from the floral arrangements to the set designs \u2014 together. Renowned wedding designer Preston Bailey, who has worked with Serena Williams and LeBron James, was commissioned to create larger-than-life floral art installations for the weekend. Speaking to CNN via email ahead of Friday\u2019s ceremony, Bailey commended Ambani\u2019s mother Nita\u2019s attention to detail. It was \u201cnothing short of pure genius and she is really focused on bringing the vast creative talent of India to the world through these weddings,\u201d he said. The inspiration for Bailey\u2019s designs came from the couple\u2019s love for animals and Ambani\u2019s recently opened animal sanctuary, Vantara, in the western Indian city of Jamnagar. His sculptural creations included a giant display of hot air balloons and more than 60 floral animals, including giraffes, two huge toucans, monkeys perched on trees inside the venue and a giant horse made from red and pink flowers. \u201cI have been in business for over 40 years \u2026 (but) I have never seen anything as intricate as this wedding and I believe it will bring such positive feedback and awareness to the great creative culture of artists of India,\u201d said Bailey, who also worked on the weddings of Ambani\u2019s two older siblings, Akash and Isha. Top Indian couturier and the wedding\u2019s creative director, Manish Malhotra, earlier told CNN that \u201cmaintaining the essence of India\u201d had been his \u201cguiding principle.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet (a traditional evening of music and dance that saw a performance from Justin Bieber) to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he said via email. Criticism and sustainability Details of the celebrations dominated local news headlines and set social media abuzz, but many within India \u2014 the world\u2019s most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people \u2014 criticized the opulence on show in a country with a glaring wealth gap and where millions live in poverty. \u201cShame on people celebrating income inequality in a country where we need wealth redistribution,\u201d tweeted comedian and social media critic, Shamita Yadav, who posts on social media as The Ranting Gola. \u201cWe are really a poor country,\u201d Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, Sushant Singh, told Indian news outlet The Wire. \u201cThis is something which is completely unacceptable. But the fact of the matter is half of India\u2019s big media is owned by Mr. Ambani, so it is unlikely that India\u2019s big media is going to say that this is horrible.\u201d Beyond the financial cost of the wedding and festivities is another, less visible cost: the one to the planet. An average Indian wedding of 300 people typically generates between 1.5 tons and 2 tons of waste, and around 30 to 40 tons of carbon emission \u2014 before taking guest travel into consideration \u2014 according to Ashwin Malwade, co-founder of Greenmyna, a Mumbai-based sustainable wedding consultancy. Sources of emissions include large-scale banquets and energy used by extravagant light displays. An event as huge in scale as the Ambani-Merchant celebration would emit far more carbon than even the largest and most lavish Indian wedding, he added. Then there\u2019s the travel, with several high-profile attendees pictured leaving Mumbai via Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport\u2019s private jet terminal. Malwade also pointed to the environmental footprint of the Ambanis\u2019 pre-wedding bash in Jamnagar, attended by public figures from around the world, including Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump, Bill Gates and Karlie Kloss; the four-day cruise arranged for guests in the Mediterranean; and the emissions required to fly in singers like Rihanna and Justin Bieber to perform at various events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/style/ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

If he wants to hit more, let him hit. We are staying, even if he wants to destroy all of Gaza and build a new one and call it Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza, we are staying.\u201d Abdul\u00a0Kareem Al Assas, a resident of Nuseirat, voiced his despair.\u00a0\u201cWhere should we go?

Trevor Ball, who was a senior explosive ordnance disposal team member in the US Army, agreed that the images likely showed part of the fin of a small-diameter bomb. Ball told CNN there were also fragments of a US-made Hellfire missile at the site, including the top of the guidance system. \u201cIt\u2019s likely there was a different munition involved as well, as there is minimal damage on the rooftop from the later strike from what pictures I saw.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/middleeast/us-munitions-israeli-strike-gaza-school-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The \u201cextremely aggressive inferno\u201d was deemed fully under control earlier this week, but weather conditions shifted Friday, setting the stage for rapid fire spread, Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador Andrew Furey said in a Facebook update Saturday. The wildfire exploded 22,000 acres in size, moving about 13 miles in just four hours, Furey said.

The blend, which is popular with influencers and regularly spotted in recipes on TikTok, contains salt, minced garlic, sesame seeds and poppy seeds \u2013 the last of which is banned in South Korea. Travelers arriving at Seoul\u2019s Incheon Airport (ICN) recently have reported seeing signs specifically mentioning the Everything But the Bagel seasoning mix not being permitted. One poster on X, formerly known as Twitter, shared a poster from the airport. The sign had a picture of the seasoning mix and read in Korean, \u201cWe would like to inform you that the following products containing poppy seeds are restricted from being brought into the country as \u2018Papaver Somniferum L,\u2019 an ingredient of the poppy family designated as narcotic substance under South Korea\u2019s narcotic drugs control law has been detected.\u201d \u201cSeed products with narcotic substances have always been banned from being brought into Korea. Recently, the customs offices have been strengthening crackdown on narcotic related items,\u201d an airport representative told CNN. The poppy plant is a vital source for the same compounds which are found in painkillers like codeine and morphine as well as street drugs like heroin, although the seeds themselves don\u2019t contain any opiates. Recently, a blogger on Korean website Naver posted about their experience bringing Trader Joe\u2019s products back from the US to South Korea. In a post made on July 14, the blogger reported that she brought back 20 bottles of the seasoning, which she learned about online. However, they came out of the luggage conveyer belt with a yellow lock on them, and she had to speak with airport officials to explain why she had brought the forbidden items into the country. \u201cThere seems to be some confusion,\u201d she wrote, adding that other people from her flight also had their products confiscated. Ultimately, \u201cI gave up the seasoning bottles and then I was let go,\u201d she concluded. And South Korea is not the only country with restrictions on poppy seeds. In Singapore, the seeds are officially classified as \u201cprohibited goods\u201d by the Central Narcotics Bureau, but people who want to bring them into the country \u2013 whether in seed form or in food products \u2013 can apply for an exemption through the country\u2019s Health Sciences Authority. Last year, the Pentagon issued a warning to members of the military that consuming poppy seeds could cause a drug test to come back positive. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, I find protecting service members and the integrity of the drug testing program requires a warning to avoid poppy seeds,\u201d read the memo. Experts say it would be all but impossible to eat enough poppy seeds to get high. \u201cPoppy seeds don\u2019t have nearly enough opiates to intoxicate you,\u201d according to an article published by the University of Florida\u2019s College of Medicine. \u201cBut because drug tests are exquisitely sensitive, consuming certain poppy seed food products can lead to\u00a0positive urine drug test results for opiates\u00a0\u2013 specifically for morphine, codeine or both.\u201d Countries in East Asia often have very strict anti-drug rules and long jail sentences for offenders. Singapore, for example, still uses the death penalty for drug trafficking offenses, including for marijuana. Last year Hong Kong declared cannabidoil (CBD) a \u201cdangerous drug\u201d on the same level as heroin and fentanyl. CBD is a chemical found in hemp and marijuana plants. It\u2019s non-psychoactive, meaning it won\u2019t get you high; instead, CBD is often marketed for everything from helping to relieve pain and inflammation to reducing stress and anxiety. Trader Joe\u2019s is a California-founded grocery store chain with more than 500 locations across the United States.

{"id": "2024_07_13_weather_beryl-houston-texas-power-outages-heat-saturday", "text": "Hundreds of thousands of southeast Texas residents are entering the sixth day in a row suffering brutal heat without air conditioning and many are scrambling to find cool shelters, food, safe drinking water and health care resources. More than 760,000 power customers in southeast Texas remain without power after Hurricane Beryl slammed the Gulf Coast Monday, leaving at least 10 people dead in Texas, two dead in Vermont and one dead in Louisiana. Hospitals, assisted living facilities, schools and water treatment plants are scraping for resources after the outages debilitated infrastructure across the region. That has led to mounting frustrations from residents that Houston\u2019s main utility provider \u2013 CenterPoint Energy \u2013 was not more prepared for the storm and renewed concerns over the state\u2019s power grid. Pregnant Houston resident Jordyn Rush, 32, worries for her health as the intense heat deprives her of sleep and her fridge sits empty while the outage drags on, making life difficult as she prepares to undergo a C-section in 12 days. \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute nightmare,\u201d Rush said. \u201cI\u2019m on the verge of like a mental breakdown. At this point, I can\u2019t tell you the last time I was able to get a full night of sleep because it\u2019s so hot. The lack of sleep is definitely wearing on me.\u201d CenterPoint Energy says it\u2019s hoping to restore power to an additional 350,000 customers by Sunday, according to a statement Friday evening. Still, half a million Houston-area homes and businesses may not have their power restored until next week, the utility company said, even as triple digit heat indices remain in the forecast. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick criticized the utility in a post Friday, saying \u201cwe should not have roughly a million homes and businesses without power this far out.\u201d \u201cWe should not have had almost every traffic light down through yesterday, with many still down. We should not have had nine fire stations without power,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cSeniors in assisted living and nursing homes should have been more of a priority for power restoration.\u201d Since Beryl pounded the region, heat advisories have been issued every day for the greater Houston area, with high temperatures in the 90s and triple-digit heat indices. Combined with power outages, alarmingly dangerous consequences have ensued. As residents desperately try to cool their homes with generators, carbon monoxide poisoning has become a serious concern. In Fort Bend County, a neighboring suburb to Houston, more than 41 people suffered carbon monoxide poisoning, Judge KP George said at a news conference Friday. In Harris County, at least two people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning and fire departments received more than 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls in 24 hours, local officials said. The US Department of Health and Human Services on Friday declared a public health emergency for Texas. \u201cThe combination of severe heat and limited access to electricity is dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations and those relying on electricity-dependent durable medical equipment and certain healthcare services,\u201d said Dawn O\u2019Connell, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, in a news release. Senior care facilities and residents who rely on electric medical devices are particularly at risk. A 71-year-old woman woman died near Crystal Beach after her oxygen machine ran out of battery power and her generator shut down. CrowdSource Rescue, a nonprofit primarily serving as a search-and-rescue group, identified roughly 120 senior living facilities that need assistance and helped deliver generators and supplies to 16 so far. A dozen Houston area hospitals are in a state of \u201cinternal disaster\u201d and more than 40 dialysis clinics are struggling with outages, Texas Emergency Management Chief\u00a0Nim\u00a0Kidd said in a news conference Thursday. Backed up hospitals prompted city officials to organize overflow beds in an indoor sports stadium, Lt. Gov. Patrick said Tuesday. In addition to health care facilities feeling the strain, residents at home are struggling to find food and water. Countless families have lost food in their warming fridges as many stores are shuttered, leaving government offices, food banks and other public services scrambling to distribute food to underserved areas. Scores of homes are also without drinking water as storm damage and power outages have left 135 wastewater treatment plants offline, according to Kidd. For Rush, who has gestational diabetes, it\u2019s been difficult to stay on the strict diet she needs to be on. \u201cI have to go in next week to do a pre-anesthesia lab draw and I\u2019m hoping that my labs aren\u2019t crazy from like a lack of nutrition and water,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart burn is out of control. I feel like I\u2019m getting dehydrated.\u201d Beryl swept through the Houston area in an unusually early start to hurricane season, knocking out power for more than 2 million customers, only about two months after a powerful derecho in the area damaged skyscrapers, downed transmission towers and left downtown dark. The Federal Emergency Management Agency granted Harris County and 14 other Texas counties financial assistance for impacted families as they face substantial repairs for homes damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Beryl. In the meantime, officials are racing to find ways to help residents beat the sweltering heat. Galveston, located south\u00a0of\u00a0Houston, is using transit buses to give some residents an \u201cair conditioned respite\u201d as portions of the city remain without power after Hurricane Beryl, according to City Manager Brian Maxwell. The city has also been distributing ice and providing portable showers. In Fort Bend County, emergency medical services is providing oxygen refills, electricity to power oxygen concentrators and rides to cooling centers. Frustration mounts with Houston utility provider The crisis comes more than three years after massive power outages hit the state. In February 2021, a deep freeze killed more than 200 people and left millions of customers without power and heat for days. Now, the ongoing outages have turned attention back to the state\u2019s power grid. Gov. Greg Abbott has requested an investigation into CenterPoint Energy and other electric companies in the wake of the outages, Patrick said at a news conference Thursday. Patrick on Friday criticized CenterPoint Energy\u2019s communication with customers and said they should have been ready for any storm hitting the Houston area. \u201cPeople have a right to be extremely frustrated with CenterPoint. People are suffering through terribly oppressive heat, a lack of food and gasoline availability, debris everywhere, and much more,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe poor and most vulnerable are suffering the most.\u201d CenterPoint in a statement Friday said it had been tracking Beryl\u2019s trajectory and preparing for its impact nine days before it made landfall. The company said it had increased crew members from 3,000 to 12,000 in response to the storm. CenterPoint CEO Jason Wells told the Houston Chronicle he is proud of the progress the company has made toward restoration but acknowledged customers\u2019 frustrations about not knowing when they will have power again. \u201cI think we could do a better job of communicating expectations with our customers, and I personally own that,\u201d Wells said. During a news conference Thursday, Patrick was asked by a reporter whether the state is considering modifying the power grid, which\u00a0has encountered several issues over the years\u00a0due to severe weather. \u201cThe grid is a whole different issue which we\u2019re addressing, have been addressing, and will continue to address,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe power is down because the lines are down, and the transmission lines are down primarily because trees fell on them.\u201d Displacement brings back memories Houston resident Destinee Rideaux, 33, is displaced for the second time after a hurricane \u2013 and this time it\u2019s because her home is too hot to live in. Because her apartment gets as hot as 96 degrees during the day, she\u2019s been forced to stay at different friends\u2019 apartments each night and carry around her belongings in her car. And Rideaux says she\u2019s \u201cexhausted.\u201d It brings back her memories of being displaced from her home in Iowa, Louisiana, during Hurricane Laura in 2020, she said. \u201cWe evacuated the day she hit. The next morning, we were able to get footage of the home and it was flattened. It was picked up and thrown across the yard and flattened. And everything we had was thrown across the yard,\u201d she told CNN. For Rush, the crisis is a repeat of the derecho in May, when her home didn\u2019t have power for six days. \ufeff\u201cWe had to clear our fridge completely for the second time in less than two months. It\u2019s our second time in less than two months of being displaced from our home,\u201d Rush said. \u201cWe are left without any communication or updates, so we have no idea what kind of plans we need to make or if we need to make preparations to find a hotel because most of the hotels here are completely booked.\u201d After Rideaux\u2019s Louisiana house was destroyed, she stayed with friends in the Houston area, and then decided to stay there permanently for a fresh start. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to be back in this position of just displacement,\u201d Rideaux\u00a0said. \u201cDuring Laura, every day I didn\u2019t know what that day would bring, where I was going to go. You also have the mental thing going on of like becoming a burden on other people.\u201d But Rideaux said this time isn\u2019t nearly as difficult because she\u2019ll be able to return to her home eventually. \u201cOnce the power comes back on, I have a home to go to,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/weather/beryl-houston-texas-power-outages-heat-saturday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The ruling, read out by Milton Maroto, one of the court\u2019s three judges, can be appealed by both the prosecution and the defense. The trial started at the end of June. Prosecutors accused at least two of those tried of belonging to the Los Lobos crime gang, among 22 criminal gangs designated as terrorists by President Daniel Noboa in January. According to the attorney general\u2019s office, Carlos Edwin Angulo Lara, known as \u2018El Invisible\u2019 (\u2018The Invisible\u2019), gave the order to murder Villavicencio from prison, while Laura Dayanara Castillo was in charge of logistics. Both Angulo and Castillo were sentenced to 34 years and eight months. Erick Ramirez, Victor Flores and Alexandra Chimbo were sentenced to 12 years. Villavicencio, whose journalism exposed corruption and connections between organized crime and politicians, had long faced threats. Prosecutors are undertaking a separate investigation into who requested the murder. One of the hitmen died at the scene of Villavicencio\u2019s murder and seven other suspects - mostly Colombian citizens -\u00a0were murdered in October\u00a0while being held in prisons on pre-trial detention.

They are now on the hunt for another man believed to be linked to the case. Officers said their priority is to find Yostin Andres Mosquera, a 24-year-old Colombian national, naming him for the first time. They released a photo of Mosquera clad in a black Adidas baseball cap, black jeans, a black jacket, black trainers with thick white soles, with a black backpack. Officers also believe they know the identity of the two male victims, but \u201cformal identification is yet to take place,\u201d they said.

The investigation began when Avon and Somerset Police received a call late on Wednesday about a man with a suitcase \u201cacting suspiciously\u201d on the bridge in Bristol.

Authorities later said a \u201cman wanted in connection with the incident had traveled to Bristol from London earlier the same day.\u201d Police previously did not identify the individual, despite a large-scale search involving a police helicopter and coastguard.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned. His office declined to give details, saying an official announcement was being prepared", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/style/fumihiko-maki-architect-dies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_europe_macron-france-mainstream-coalition-intl", "text": "Three days after the second round of France\u2019s snap parliamentary election ended in gridlock, President Emmanuel Macron broke his silence to urge mainstream parties to form a solid majority in the National Assembly and shut out the extremes. France\u2019s vote, which Macron unexpectedly called after his party was trounced by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party in last month\u2019s European elections, has tipped France into political limbo, after none of the three main blocs came close to forming an absolute majority. In an open letter to the French people published Wednesday, Macron called on parties with \u201crepublican values\u201d \u2013 understood to exclude parties on the far left and far right \u2013 to form a coalition large enough to pass laws in parliament. Macron\u2019s comments suggest he is unwilling to work with the more extreme part of the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition, which secured the most seats in the French parliament in Sunday\u2019s second-round vote, but not enough to govern independently. \u201cI call on all political forces that recognize themselves in republican institutions, the rule of law, parliamentarianism, a European orientation and the defense of French independence, to engage in sincere and loyal dialogue to build a solid majority, necessarily plural, for the country,\u201d wrote Macron. Macron said it was \u201cin light of these principles\u201d that he will decide on the appointment of France\u2019s next prime minister. \u201cThis means giving the political forces a little time to build these compromises with serenity and respect for each other,\u201d he said. The NFP won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group in the 577-seat parliament. Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which trailed in a distant third in the first round, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. And the RN and its allies, despite leading the first round, won 143 seats. It is customary for the French president to appoint a prime minister from the largest parliamentary group \u2013 in this case the NFP \u2013 and ask it to form a government. But Macron and his Ensemble allies have repeatedly refused to enter into coalition with the far-left France Unbowed, the largest single party within the NFP, and have accused its leader, the 72-year-old firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, of being just as extreme and unfit to govern as figures on the far right. The NFP formed days after Macron called the snap vote, and chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. After tactical voting and political bargaining between centrist and left-wing voters, the NFP managed the same feat in Sunday\u2019s second round. But the NFP does not speak with a single voice. The various parties in the coalition straddle vast ideological ground, from the far-left France Unbowed to the more moderate Place Publique and Socialist parties. When the shock result was announced, each party celebrated separately, and the bloc still has not nominated a leader to become prime minister. M\u00e9lenchon has stated his intention to govern France. In a victory speech Sunday evening near Stalingrad Square in Paris, he said Macron \u201chas the duty\u201d to ask the NFP to form a government. Unlike its neighbors Italy and Germany, France \u2013 with its presidential system \u2013 lacks the culture of coalition-building and compromise, meaning the formation of a new government could take weeks and prove fleeting. Newly-elected members of parliament, called \u201cdeputies,\u201d are scheduled to take their seats for the first time on July 18. But without a clear majority, a minority government faces the risk of no-confidence votes, which could lead to several governments replacing each other in quick succession. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal\u2019s offer to resign was on Monday rejected by Macron, leaving him in place in a caretaker role until the new government is formed. \u201cThe current government will continue to exercise its responsibilities, then take care of day-to-day business in accordance with republican tradition,\u201d Macron said, in an attempt to calm the situation two weeks out from the Olympic Games\u2019 opening ceremony in Paris.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/europe/macron-france-mainstream-coalition-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_europe_orban-trump-eu-ukraine-letter-intl", "text": "Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor\u00a0Orban\u00a0has told European leaders that Donald Trump is \u201cready to act as a peace broker\u201d between Russia and Ukraine if elected president, amid concerns across the continent that Trump would attempt to force Kyiv into ceding territory to Moscow. Orban\u2019s letter, addressed to European Council President Charles Michel and sent to all European Union leaders, was written in the wake of\u00a0his controversial meetings with former President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \u201cI can [\u2026] surely state that shortly after his election victory, he will not wait until his inauguration, [Trump] will be ready to act as a peace broker immediately. He has detailed and well-founded plans for this,\u201d\u00a0Orban wrote. The authoritarian Hungarian premier has sought to cast himself as a peacemaker in the conflict, but his stance is at odds with most EU leaders, who have pledged unequivocal support for Ukraine as it attempts to repel Russia\u2019s military effort. In his letter to those leaders,\u00a0Orban\u00a0said that during the meetings there was a \u201cgeneral observation\u201d that \u201cthe intensity of the military conflict\u201d in Ukraine \u201cwill radically escalate in the near future.\u201d Orban\u00a0also hinted at Trump\u2019s plans to potentially pare back aid to Ukraine if elected, saying: \u201cI am more than convinced that in the likely outcome of the victory of President Trump, the proportion of the financial burden between the US and the EU will significantly change to the EU\u2019s disadvantage when it comes to the financial support of Ukraine.\u201d Trump, who has a propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy, said during a CNN town hall last year that, \u201cIf I\u2019m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.\u201d In last month\u2019s CNN debate with President Joe Biden, Trump said that Putin\u2019s terms for an agreement \u2013 which would include Ukraine ceding the four territories currently occupied by Russia \u2013 are \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d But the former president, who is set to formally accept the Republican nomination at the party\u2019s national convention later this week, has also criticized US military aid to Kyiv. Orban \u2013 a rare, longtime ally of Trump in the EU \u2013 has undertaken what he has previously called his \u201cpeace missions,\u201d\u00a0meeting Putin\u00a0in Moscow on July 5 and\u00a0Xi in Beijing\u00a0on July 8. Last Thursday he met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. He also visited\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv at the start of July, marking his first visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. Orban called on EU leaders to try to find a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to usher in a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in EU policy in his letter, urging them to \u201cmake an effort to decrease tensions and/or create the conditions for a temporary ceasefire and/or start peace negotiations\u201d in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Hungary took over the rotating EU presidency last month, unveiling a slogan \u2013 \u201cMake Europe Great Again\u201d \u2013 that mimicked Trump\u2019s 2016 election motto. But his visits with Putin, Xi and Trump have gone down poorly with EU lawmakers, who have accused\u00a0Orban\u00a0of vitally \u201cmisrepresenting\u201d and \u201cundermining\u201d the EU\u2019s stance on foreign policy.  In a letter to Orban Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel hit back against many of the points made by the Hungarian prime minister. \u201cThe most direct way to peace is for Russia to withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine and respect Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and the UN Charter,\u201d Michel wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. Michel wrote that \u201cno discussion about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine\u201d and rejected Orban\u2019s claim that the EU has led a \u201cpro-war policy,\u201d saying that \u201cit is quite the opposite.\u201d \u201cRussia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim exercising its legitimate right to self-defense. Russia is leading a war of aggression in blatant violation of international law, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with the UN Charter,\u201d Michel wrote. Michel noted \u201cthe EU\u2019s position on Ukraine is agreed by consensus by the European Council, and was confirmed most recently in June.\u201d The European Council president also told Orban that Hungary, which holds the rotating presidency of the council until the end of the year, \u201chas no role in representing the (European Union) on the international stage and received no European Council mandate to engage on behalf of the union.\u201d \u201cI made this clear even prior to your visit to Moscow and this was subsequently reiterated by High Representative Borrell in his statement of July 5,\u201d Michel wrote. Michel said in his letter that he would share it with the other members of the European Council, and would \u201calso inform Ukraine of this exchange.\u201d A separate\u00a0letter signed by 63 European lawmakers, addressed to the three EU chiefs, said\u00a0Orban\u00a0had \u201ccaused significant damage\u201d through his meetings. \u201cIn his so-called peace mission, Prime Minister\u00a0Orban\u00a0deliberately left the impression that he was acting on behalf of the entire European Union, whereas in reality he has no authority to represent the EU or any other member state other than his own,\u201d the Members of European Parliament said. The lawmakers called the meetings particularly damaging considering that Hungary currently holds the presidency of the European Council, saying\u00a0Orban\u00a0was guilty of \u201cabusing\u201d the position that he assumed at the beginning of July. EU lawmakers finished their letter by calling on the bloc\u2019s three leaders, Michel, Ursula von der Leyen and Roberta Metsola, to suspend Hungary\u2019s voting rights in the European Council, arguing that past examples had shown that \u201cmere verbal condemnation\u201d of Hungary has \u201cno effect.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/europe/orban-trump-eu-ukraine-letter-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

In an interview with The UK\u2019s Times published last week, Montgomerie suggested that it was time for Woods to hang up his golf clubs amid battles with injury and form. \u201cI hope people remember Tiger as Tiger was, the passion and the charismatic aura around him,\u201d said Montgomerie. \u201cThere is none of that now. At Pinehurst, he did not seem to enjoy a single shot and you think, \u2018What the hell is he doing?\u2019 He\u2019s coming to Troon and he won\u2019t enjoy it there either.\u201d When it was put to him that Woods has said he will retire when he feels he is no longer competitive, Montgomerie added: \u201cAren\u2019t we there? I\u2019d have thought we were past there. There is a time for all sportsmen to say goodbye, but it\u2019s very difficult to tell Tiger it\u2019s time to go. Obviously, he still feels he can win. We are more realistic. \u201cThese guys only know Tiger Woods missing the cut and he\u2019s better than that, the best we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d In his pre-tournament press conference ahead of this year\u2019s Open, which tees off Thursday, Woods took the opportunity to address Montgomerie\u2019s comments, referencing the fact that he has earned automatic qualification for the major through his past victories at the event. \u201cWell, as a past champion, I\u2019m exempt until I\u2019m 60. Colin\u2019s not,\u201d the 48-year-old Woods told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s not a past champion, so he\u2019s not exempt. So he doesn\u2019t get the opportunity to make that decision. I do.\u201d Woods has battled with injuries and rehabilitation ever since suffering leg injuries in a serious car crash in 2021. The 15-time major winner has prioritized appearances at the four major championships in his sporadic competitive appearances in recent years. After the 2023 Masters in which Woods withdrew with injury, Montgomerie told CNN Sport\u2019s Patrick Snell that the US golfer might have missed the perfect opportunity to walk away from the sport in the previous year. \u201cIt was very difficult to see. I don\u2019t think Augusta was the course to come back on. Augusta is a mountain climb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very physically demanding. More so than anyone would ever imagine. So to come back on that one was unfortunate. The cold, damp weather on Saturday was enough for him. It was too much. \u201cShould he have retired last year at St. Andrew\u2019s (at The Open in 2022)? The opportunity was golden. The sun was shining. The Swilcan bridge was waiting for the wave. A lot of people thought it might happen then. It possibly should have done.\u201d In the three majors in 2024, Woods has missed the cut at two \u2013 the PGA Championship and the US Open \u2013 while he finished 60th at the Masters. Woods has won The Open in 2000, 2005 and 2006. Although he has struggled physically in recent years, he said his body is \u201cfeeling better\u201d in the lead up to this year\u2019s tournament. \u201cI\u2019ve been training a lot better. We\u2019ve been busting it pretty hard in the gym, which has been good. Body\u2019s been feeling better to be able to do such things, and it translates on being able to hit the ball better,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t quite stay out there during a practice session as long as I\u2019d like, but I\u2019m able to do some things that I haven\u2019t done all year, which is nice.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/sport/tiger-woods-colin-montgomerie-retirement-golf-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2015_07_20_travel_shark-attack-how-to-survive", "text": "First things first. Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon. But sharks do occasionally attack humans \u2013 and they certainly make news when they do: \u2022 A man was recovering in mid-July after being bitten by a shark off Key West in Florida \u2022 A 14-year-old boy was bitten in the leg by a shark at a\u00a0North Carolina beach\u00a0in late June 2024. \u2022 A lifeguard and surf instructor, who also appeared in \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,\u201d died after an apparent\u00a0shark\u00a0attack on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii, in late June 2024. \u2022 Florida fire officials asked beachgoers to exercise caution in early June 2024 after three people were injured in two separate shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other at neighboring Walton County beaches. \u2022 A woman was bitten by a bull shark in Sydney Harbour not far from the city\u2019s iconic Opera House in January 2024. And a Russian citizen was killed by a shark in the Red Sea in Egypt on June 2023. While these kinds of encounters understandably cause would-be ocean swimmers to worry, there\u2019s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines. The Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s International Shark Attack File found just 69 confirmed, unprovoked shark attacks on people and 36 confirmed bites worldwide in 2023. That compares with 57 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 32 bites in 2022. Think about it a minute \u2013 the world population is more than 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And that\u2019s all the shark attacks recorded. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher. In 2023, the United States once again led the way in unprovoked attacks in 2023 at 36; Florida had the highest state total at 16. That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel. Before you get in the water Know your environment Sharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,\u201d said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.  \u201cFortunately, humans aren\u2019t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.\u201d Still, there are places you\u2019re more likely to encounter a shark.  River mouths are not the best place to swim You should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.  Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks. \u201cAn awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river \u2013 people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,\u201d said Peirce. Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out. Avoid areas with fishing Before you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says \u201cforget it.\u201d \u201cWhether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,\u201d he said.   Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That\u2019s a possible sign a shark might be nearby. He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore. Avoid dusk and dawn Swimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it\u2019s also the time when a shark attack is most likely. \u201cA lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,\u201d Peirce says, \u201cdue to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.\u201d Hang with lifeguards Chris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to \u201cdo your homework\u201d before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places. If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.  \u201cI always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It\u2019s a lot safer,\u201d he said. Don\u2019t wear shiny objects in the water \u201cBe careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.\u201d Lowe said. In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.\u201d Follow your instincts \u201cProbably the most important thing is to follow your gut,\u201d Hammerschlag said. \u201cIf you feel wary about getting in the water \u2026 just don\u2019t go in the water.\u201d \u201cA lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn\u2019t listen to it,\u201d he said. If a shark is nearby Don\u2019t panic So you\u2019re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic. \u201cDon\u2019t start splashing around \u2013 you\u2019re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark\u2019s interest,\u201d said Peirce. Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose. \u201cA shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it\u2019s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we often get exploratory bites which don\u2019t result in death and sometimes don\u2019t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you\u2019re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.\u201d Maintain eye contact As the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact. \u201cSharks are ambush predators,\u201d Peirce explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it\u2019s not going to be half as comfortable as if it\u2019s able to sneak up from behind.\u201d Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you\u2019re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore. If you\u2019re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. \u201cLet the shark know it\u2019s being watched.\u201d Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,\u201d Fragola says in the video. Stay big or get small This is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.  \u201cThe bigger you are in the water, the more respect you\u2019ll get,\u201d he said. But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce\u2019s advice is to roll up into a ball. \u201cIf a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor \u2013 and if it wasn\u2019t showing massive interest in me \u2013 I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.\u201d If you\u2019re being attacked Don\u2019t play dead This isn\u2019t a bear, it\u2019s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots \u2013 but be careful where you aim. \u201cThere\u2019s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That\u2019s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThis is a moving object in the water and you\u2019re not staying still either, so what you don\u2019t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.\u201d A good shot to the gills can also do the job: \u201cThe gills are very sensitive \u2013 giving a shark a whack in the gills isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201d Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you\u2019re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,\u201d Peirce says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it\u2019s (been) enough to use a shark billy \u2013 a small metal rod between two and three feet long \u2013 and I\u2019ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.\u201d It\u2019s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you\u2019ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten. Cut off the angles If you\u2019re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can\u2019t get behind you, says Peirce. \u201cKeep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you\u2019ve only got one direction to look. You\u2019re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.\u201d Slowly back away Displace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore. \u201cYou must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you\u2019ve got to be careful \u2013 large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.\u201d Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim. \u201cIf a white shark is in full attack mode, there\u2019s not much you\u2019re going to be able to do at that point,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2015/07/20/travel/shark-attack-how-to-survive/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_africa_dead-seals-cape-town-beaches-intl", "text": "Dead seals are washing up along beaches in South Africa\u2019s port city of Cape Town, a coastal management official told CNN Friday, amid an outbreak of rabies in the marine animals. \u201cWe believe this to be the first spread of rabies within a marine mammal population and that is concerning for us,\u201d said Cape Town\u2019s coastal manager Gregg Oelofse. Rabies in seals is rare and the only known case of the viral disease in a seal was\u00a0detected in the Svalbard islands of Norway\u00a0in 1980. Cape Town, home to\u00a0dozens of beaches\u00a0and a coastline extending over 300 kilometers (186 miles), harbors thousands of Cape fur\u00a0seals, a seal species\u00a0native to\u00a0southern Africa. The city has recorded \u201c11 positive rabies cases in seals so far,\u201d with the last positive case detected in a seal tested 10 days ago, according to Oelofse. He urged calm however, saying it is normal to find carcasses of Cape fur\u00a0seals\u00a0along the shoreline. While \u201clots\u201d of dead seals have washed ashore this week, many of them have died naturally, he said. He added that laboratory investigations were ongoing to determine how the seals were infected with the disease. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet where it started. They are genetically sequencing the rabies virus found. We will know when they are done with that,\u201d he said. The Western Cape provincial health department\u00a0alerted residents of a rabies risk\u00a0last month, warning of \u201cthe potential for rabies cases along the entire coastline where seals are present.\u201d Authorities said in late June that they had\u00a0confirmed seven cases of the disease\u00a0in seals from seven beaches in Cape Town and elsewhere on the Western Cape, urging residents to avoid contact with the animals. The first case was detected in October 2023, they noted. \u201cThere is no cause for panic,\u201d Cape Town city authorities stated at the time, adding that \u201cwhile rabies is new in Cape fur seals, it is endemic in many wildlife populations in South Africa.\u201d The area has witnessed many seal deaths in recent years. In November 2021, Western Cape provincial officials said they buried\u00a0close to 200 dead seals in a single day\u00a0after their carcasses washed ashore from suspected malnutrition. Rabies, which\u00a0is almost always fatal\u00a0once symptoms appear, is an infectious viral disease that affects the brain and central nervous system. According to the World Health Organization, dogs are the main source of\u00a0rabies transmission to humans. The virus is transmitted to humans through animal bites or scratches and can take between three and\u00a012 weeks\u00a0to begin showing symptoms. Oelofse said there was yet to be a seal-to-human transmission of rabies in Cape Town and the city\u2019s authorities were working to prevent it. \u201cWe have a lot of people\u00a0that are\u00a0coming into contact with seals daily such as surfers, kayakers, scuba divers, and others. So, one of the things that we want to avoid is the potential of transfer of rabies to a person and so far, that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/africa/dead-seals-cape-town-beaches-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_style_dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon", "text": "Pristine, crisp and all-white \u2014 tennis whites have been a tradition dating back centuries. The distinctive look has not only made the racquet sport stand out, it has also become a sartorial mainstay off the courts, too. And even though most of the major tournaments have done away with the hueless uniformity, Wimbledon, the very first of them, has remained strict in its policy (as have many private clubs around the world). The prestigious championship even clamped down on the rule a decade ago, prohibiting colorful accents that had become increasingly common \u2014\u00a0 the year after Roger Federer\u2019s now-infamous pair of orange-soled sneakers were banned after his first round in 2013. The rules once called for \u201cpredominantly white\u201d outfits, allowing some competitors to play with color combinations, such as Serena Williams\u2019 tribute to Wimbledon treat strawberries and cream in 2010. But the crackdown changed the wording to \u201calmost entirely white,\u201d per the organizers: no off-white, no panels of color, no varying colorways on sneakers. The only recent loosening of rules was in 2023, to allow women to wear dark-colored shorts on the court following criticisms that the rules weren\u2019t accommodating for menstruation leaks. But why did tennis whites become the standard? The reasons often cited are practical ones, from heat reflection to sweat-masking. But senior curator Kevin Jones of the ASU Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (ASU FIDM) Museum in Los Angeles, who organized the recent traveling exhibition \u201cSporting Fashion: Outdoor Girls 1800 - 1960,\u201d said it really comes down to a long history of clubs enforcing social status, starting when lawn tennis skyrocketed in popularity in Victorian-era England as a leisure sport \u2014 and a rare one that allowed women, too. \u201cIt\u2019s completely elitist because white clothes are difficult to maintain,\u201d he said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cAnd the types of materials that these dresses were made of, which were cottons and linens, creased easily, so to keep them nice and freshly starched was also an aspect of that care.\u201d Challenging the rules Of course, tennis style has drastically changed in a century-and-a-half since it first became a recreational sensation for the upper class, hot off the heels of croquet (and utilizing the same neatly trimmed lawns). Early tennis attire was more akin to 19th-century leisurewear: women wore striped and patterned garments with long skirts, corseting and wide-brimmed hats; men donned wool pants, button-downs or sweaters. Because spectators and players have often adhered to similar styles, fashion and tennis have had a \u201cmutual exchange over time, where various tennis trends have seeped into wider culture as well,\u201d said sports journalist Ben Rothenberg, author of \u201cTennis: The Stylish Life\u201d as well as a recent biography on Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s been more than apparent in the past few months as Zendaya turned out a series of tennis-inspired high-fashion red-carpet looks matching the on- and off-court drama of the film \u201cChallengers,\u201d and recently faced Federer in an \u201cair tennis\u201d match for a campaign by the sportswear brand On. The close alignment with fashion has also led to the success of classic tennis-born labels such as Lacoste and Fred Perry, as well as radical new fashion innovations introduced on the court, like Elsa Schiaparelli dressing Spanish player Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez in culottes, a split skirt, for Wimbledon in 1931, to onlookers\u2019 shock. Like with De \u00c1lvarez, dress codes in tennis have often changed after an initial scandal. The French player Suzanne Lenglen was one of the earliest and most memorable cases, when she did away with layered, long dresses and wore a more airy calf-length skirt and shorter sleeves at Wimbledon in 1919. A muse to the designer Jean Patou, Lenglen became tennis\u2019 first fashion icon with her signature headscarf and then-provocative shorter hems. At the US, French and Australian Open, players have challenged definitions of what tennis clothes can be thanks to looser rules (subject to referee opinion). None have done so more than the Williams sisters, with Serena wearing a denim mini, tutus and cape-like silhouettes and Venus\u2019s lacy black-and-red ensemble that drew comparisons to lingerie. More recently, Serena Williams\u2019 Nike kit became the topic of conversation at the 2018 French Open when she opted for a black compression catsuit that didn\u2019t feature the compulsory tennis skirt. Though she cited its circulation benefits following a severe blood-clot scare with the birth of her child, the French Open said it would bar the style in the future. However, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association formally allowed it, and Williams continued to wear versions of the bodysuit at the 2019 and 2021 Australian Opens, normalizing the agile and simplified cut for the tennis court. \u201cI love wearing skirts,\u201d she told CNN in April while reflecting on the controversy. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure that my blood was always circulating and I had been in a near-death experience.\u201d \u201cSo I think there should have been\u2026 understanding around that whole outfit,\u201d she added. Brand distinctions Most of the Grand Slam tournaments dropped the all-white rules decades ago, likely in a bid to attract more television viewers and advertisers in an age of increased visibility for the sport. \u201cColor is vital to draw the eye and especially for those sports companies to be able to advertise their logos and their colors,\u201d Jones explained. Sports and luxury brands advertise through fashion in multiple ways, from dressing star players in custom statement pieces to promoting merchandised designs on competitors. Wimbledon\u2019s restrictive rules have been \u201cfrustrating\u201d for brands trying to sell their tournament collections, Rothenberg said. When Fila introduced Bjorn Borg throwback shirts in 2001, replicating what the tennis star wore during his five-time-winning Wimbledon streak from 1976 to 1980, Wimbledon officials said they no longer adhered to the rules. The decision sent the sports brand \u201cscrambling\u201d to get new shirts to the players wearing them, Rothenberg explained. And, after Federer\u2019s orange-soled shoes were banned, Nike had to act fast to spin their brief appearance, advertising them as \u201cOne Match Wonders\u201d in a print ad. For players, the smallest infractions have proved controversial, and some players have outright refused to play along, as Andre Agassi did from 1988-90 when he boycotted Wimbledon entirely. In 2017, Jurij Rodionov was told to change blue underwear that was peeking out of his shirts, while Sabine Lisicki recently said that she and women were often required to switch out their skin-colored bras. But Rothenberg doesn\u2019t see more leniency happening anytime soon from Wimbledon\u2019s decision-makers. \u201cI think Wimbledon sees its anachronisms as a big part of its brand and its value,\u201d he explained. \u201cWimbledon has clung on to it as a way to be distinct and different \u2014 and I think it\u2019s largely been successful. It doesn\u2019t look like any other tournament.\u201d There have been criticisms levied against the major tournaments whenever women players seem to be disproportionately affected by their dress codes, and though Rothenberg agrees, he also points out that women\u2019s styles have been more creative. Men\u2019s tenniswear has deviated less from shorts and lightwear polos or shortsleeve athletic shirts since they were introduced. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of men\u2019s short length getting markedly shorter over the last 12 months though, especially players who really have hiked up their shorts a lot,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe someday there will be rules against that if they start showing too much cheek.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled a source\u2019s surname and misstated the current name of the ASU FIDM Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_middleeast_mohammed-deif-hamas-commander-israeli-strike-intl", "text": "Israel has targeted Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Deif in a strike on a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza which killed at least 90 Palestinians. It is not clear yet if Deif was among the dead. But who is he? An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attacks. He has led the Palestinian militant group\u2019s armed wing for more than two decades. If his death is confirmed, Deif would be the highest profile Hamas leader killed since the war in Gaza began nine months ago. Israel has been seeking to dismantle Hamas following the October 7 attacks but with fighting ongoing and senior Hamas figures at large, that goal has seemed distant. Deif is thought to have been born in the 1960s in the Khan Younis refugee camp, one of a number of such camps established in Gaza at the end of the 1940s for displaced Palestinians denied the freedom to return to their homes by the newly-created state of Israel. Born as Mohammad Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, he later became known as \u201cEl Deif\u201d or \u201cthe Guest\u201d due to his habit of staying in different houses every night for decades to avoid being tracked and killed by Israel. Deif has been at the top of Israel\u2019s most wanted list for decades, with Israel holding him responsible for the deaths of dozens of its citizens. Both the US and the EU have him on terror blacklists. He joined Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987. He became a founding member of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, in the early 1990s. The military unit was established to support Hamas in its armed resistance against Israel and has since carried out numerous attacks, including suicide bombings. From the beginning, Deif has been a key architect in Hamas\u2019s strategy against Israel. He was behind a wave of suicide attacks in 1996 that killed 65 people in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as well as other acts intended to derail the Israel-Palestine peace process. Deif rose through the ranks of the Qassam Brigades to be named its leader in 2002, after the previous commander was killed by Israel. Considered a highly-skilled bomb maker, he has played a significant role in developing Hamas\u2019s network of tunnels and bomb-making expertise. Over the years, Deif has survived numerous assassination attempts \u2013 a total of seven, according to Reuters. This includes a 2014 Israeli strike that killed his wife, his seven-month-old son and three-year-old daughter. He was seriously injured in one of the assassination attempts, sustaining serious leg injuries and losing an eye. Deif is understood to have played a role in orchestrating Hamas\u2019s brutal cross-border raids on October 7, which saw around 1,200 Israelis killed. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 38,000 people. Soon after the attacks, he called for a general uprising. \u201cIf you have a gun, get it out. This is the time to use it \u2013 get out with trucks, cars, axes, today the best and most honorable history starts,\u201d he said in a recorded message.

Twenty-one-year-old Elimelech Stern is suspected of completing \u201cmissions\u201d given to him by a social media user with the pseudonym \u201cAnna Elena\u201d in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards. The suspect, charged Tuesday, was tasked with posting public notices in Tel Aviv, hiding money in various locations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and delivering packages containing threatening messages, including a severed head of an animal, to the doorsteps of Israeli citizens, and completed the tasks, the Israel Security Agency (ISA) and the police said. The ISA, also known as Shin Bet or Shabak, is Israel\u2019s domestic security agency. Stern was also asked to start a forest fire and kill someone, according to the joint statement, but did not carry out these tasks. The security authorities allege that Stern recruited and paid two additional Israeli citizens to perform some of the tasks. The two other citizens were interrogated and released from custody at the end of their investigation while they await a decision on their case, the authorities said. The Israeli security services did not say how they traced the case to Iranian intelligence other than saying that widely distributed text messages of a similar nature contained a reference to the website of the International Security Agency of Iran. \u201cThe use of the method of contacting Israeli citizens through social networks, under the false representation of the identity of the person making the request, is a well-known method of operation of the Iranian intelligence agencies,\u201d the authorities said.

Los Blancos announced last month that the club had signed Mbapp\u00e9 to a five-year deal, ending the French superstar\u2019s seven-year stint at Paris Saint-Germain. A montage of Real\u2019s successes throughout history and the sound of Luciano Pavarotti\u2019s rendition of \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d precluded Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s entrance into the stadium, followed by a highlight reel of the French superstar\u2019s goals shown on a big screen. This has been a highly-anticipated moment for Real Madrid fans, who have long been hopeful of seeing the 25-year-old \u2013 rated among the best current players in the world \u2013 wear their club\u2019s famous white jersey. Having won a 15th European crown at the end of last season, Real has only strengthened its squad, which already includes the likes of Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Jude Bellingham, with the signing of Mbapp\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible day for me, incredible,\u201d the forward told those inside the stadium. \u201cSince I was a boy, I had only one dream: to play here. And to be here now means a lot to me. \u201cBecause of that, I want to thank every\u00a0madridista\u00a0because, since years ago, you\u2019ve given me a lot of affection, a lot of love \u2013 that goes directly to my heart. And so I want to say thank you to everyone to let me be here today.\u201d After his speech, Mbapp\u00e9 greeted fans in attendance, signing autographs and kicking footballs into the stands. His official unveiling concludes one of the longest-running transfer sagas in\u00a0soccer, with Mbapp\u00e9 long harboring ambitions of a move to the Spanish capital. Despite his considerable success in domestic competitions \u2013 winning six French league titles with PSG and one with AS Monaco \u2013 he is yet to add a Champions League to his list of career achievements. Mbapp\u00e9 played more than 300 games for PSG, scoring his 250th goal in March, and with France, he won the World Cup in 2018 and the Golden Boot in 2022, leading scoring at the tournament with eight goals. At the recently concluded European Championships, he captained France to a semifinal defeat against eventual champion Spain. \u201cNow, I have another dream,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 added at his unveiling. \u201cThis is a dream that I have to accomplish: it\u2019s to meet the expectations of the history of this club, the best in the world. I can say one thing: I\u2019m going to give my life for this club and for this badge.\u201d The star evoked another soccer superstar in his presentation at multiple points: Cristiano Ronaldo. Mbapp\u00e9 mimicked his childhood hero by kissing the club badge at one point before telling those assembled in the Bernab\u00e9u, \u201cI\u2019m going to say one, two, three and we\u2019re all going to say together, \u2018Hala Madrid\u2019 like one big family,\u201d echoing Ronaldo\u2019s actions during his own Los Blancos presentation in the summer of 2009. \u201cOne, two, three\u2026 Hala Madrid!\u201d Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s parents were among the huge crowd in the stands for his unveiling as a Real player, while club legend Zinedine Zidane also greeted him as he stepped into the stadium.

Tens of thousands of students joined nationwide protests for a second day after more than 100 people were\u00a0injured on Monday\u00a0in rallies that blocked major highways and rail links. They are the first significant protests against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s government since she won a fourth straight term in January. The protesters are angry over public sector job quotas, including a 30% quota for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 War of Independence, amid high youth unemployment. Riot police fanned out at university campuses across the country in an effort to quell disturbances. In Rangpur in northwestern\u00a0Bangladesh, the protests turned violent, police told Reuters. \u201cWe had to use rubber bullets and teargas to disperse the unruly students who were hurling stones at us,\u201d Rangpur Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mohammad Moniruzzaman said. \u201cWe heard a protesting student died after he was taken to hospital. It was not immediately clear how he died,\u201d he said. In the capital Dhaka, TV footage showed a heavy presence of police, wearing protective vests and helmets and armed with wooden sticks, outside the Dhaka University campus. One student was found lying in a pool of blood and declared dead at city hospital, police said. Three people, including two students, were killed in the port city of Chittagong. \u201cWe are not sure how they were killed as we didn\u2019t use any force in Chittagong,\u201d local police chief Saiful Islam said. The Border Guard\u00a0Bangladesh\u00a0paramilitary force was deployed across the country to tighten security as clashes continued in several places, the force said. Stagnant job growth in\u00a0Bangladesh\u2019s private sector has made government jobs, which offer regular wage hikes and other privileges, more attractive, said Mohammad Abdur Razzaque, chairman of Research and Policy Integration for Development. Nearly 32 million young\u00a0Bangladeshis are not in work or education, he said. In\u00a0Bangladesh, 56% of government jobs are reserved for various quotas. Ten percent are reserved for women, 10% for people from underdeveloped districts, 5% for indigenous communities and 1% for people with disabilities. Violence erupted on Monday when thousands of anti-quota protesters clashed with members of the student wing of the ruling Awami League party. Protesters have planned more marches and rallies nationwide and demonstrations will continue until their demands are met, said Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the anti-quota protests. Protests began earlier this month when the High Court ordered the government to reinstate the 30% job quota. The Supreme Court suspended the order last week for a month but protests continued and they intensified after Hasina refused to meet the students\u2019 demands, citing ongoing court proceedings. Hasina labeled those opposing the quota as \u201crazakar\u201d \u2013 a term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 war \u2013 prompting more protests.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/asia/bangladesh-protests-quote-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_13_asia_malayan-tiger-deaths-malaysia-extinction-intl-hnk", "text": "A recent spate of alarming deaths has heightened fears for the Malayan tiger, wildlife authorities and conservationists say, with some calling the threat to Malaysia\u2019s emblematic animal a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d Native to the jungles of peninsular Malaysia, the majestic feline subspecies is critically endangered, with fewer than 150 believed to be left in the wild due to habitat loss, illegal poaching and a decline in prey. Found on Malaysia\u2019s coat of arms and considered a national heritage symbol, its numbers have plummeted since the 1950s, when around 3,000 roamed the Southeast Asian country, officials say. Against that already grim backdrop, photos and videos of a dead Malayan tiger went viral on social media in late June. The carcass, found bloated and floating in a stream in the rural northern state of Kelantan, was discovered by forest rangers. There was no sign of injury from snares or gunshots, and state forestry officials are conducting a post-mortem examination. The images provoked strong reactions from many in Malaysia, who noted the urgency of saving their national symbol from extinction. \u201cThe plight of Malayan tigers is a national crisis that requires the full attention and commitment of all Malaysians,\u201d Henry Chan, director of conservation at the World Wildlife Fund Malaysia (WWF), told CNN. Stronger conservation efforts are needed, he added, such as enhancing patrols in critical tiger habitats and leveraging advanced technology such as camera traps and drones for monitoring and surveillance. \u201cThese magnificent creatures continue to teeter on the brink of extinction,\u201d Chan said. \u201cLosing just one tiger brings the entire species closer to extinction, making every individual tiger\u2019s life extremely critical to the survival of the species.\u201d \u201cThe Malayan tiger is on the brink of extinction with fewer than 150 remaining in the wild,\u201d said Mark Rayan Darmaraj, country director of Wildlife Conservation Society Malaysia, who noted that suspected poachers were arrested in a separate case in the nearby state of Pahang the following day, \u201cin possession of the skull and bones of a tiger.\u201d \u201cThey suffer from habitat loss, prey depletion and retaliatory killings stemming from human-tiger conflicts,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, the construction of roads through their habitats increases the risk of fatal vehicle collisions as seen in several recent incidents.\u201d On July 6, authorities in the western state of Perak were alerted to a dead tiger found in a storm drain off a major highway. Estimated to have been around 4 years old, the adult male had been hit by a car, officials said. A month earlier, the body of another adult tiger was found by an expressway in Pahang state. Officials believe the tiger, believed to have been 5 years old, was run over by a vehicle while trying to cross the road from a nearby forest reserve. It was the fourth Malayan tiger killed by a vehicle collision between November 2023 and May 2024, according to authorities. Eight-year plan The Malayan tiger was recognized as a subspecies in 2004. Like all tigers, they are excellent swimmers and powerful apex predators. Smaller than Indonesia\u2019s Sumatran tigers and the Bengal tigers found across South Asia, Malayan tigers can grow to about 2.5 meters (about 8 feet) long and weigh up to 130 kilograms (about 280 pounds), experts say, and need large swaths of forest to roam. Their slightly darker, reddish-orange coats also distinguish them from other tiger species. In an eight-year National Tiger Conservation Action Plan released in collaboration with non-profit groups in 2020, Malaysian officials outlined priorities such as conservation tools and a \u201cNational Physical Plan\u201d to aid conservation efforts. \u201cBy implementing a suite of concerted actions, backed by political commitment and public support, we as a nation and as part of the global conservation community can ensure that one of the most majestic and charismatic animals with which we share the planet will not vanish,\u201d the report said.

If Monday\u2019s bid had been successful, the tiny West African country would have been the first in the world to relegalize FGM after criminalizing it. MP Amadou Camara, who chairs a joint health and gender committee that recommended that FGM should remain outlawed, told CNN that none of the clauses seeking the repeal of the ban in the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed. Parliament Speaker Fabakary Jatta\u00a0ruled that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the bill, which passed a second reading four months ago, to be read a third time and to pass without those clauses. \u201cI so rule that the bill is rejected, and the legislative process exhausted,\u201d Jatta said at plenary meeting Monday. FGM was prohibited in Gambia in 2015 by former president Yahya Jammeh who authorized the\u00a0imposition of fines and prison sentences\u00a0of up to three years for individuals who engaged in it. The law also punished perpetrators with life sentences in cases where the practice led to death. Pro-Islamic groups and lawmakers pushed back against the criminalization, saying that female circumcision was \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d Other prominent Gambians, such as opposition leader and former interior minister Mai Ahmad Fatty also defended the practice, arguing that: \u201cThere is no FGM in Gambia. We circumcise, not mutilate.\u201d Human rights organization Amnesty International earlier described efforts to revoke the FGM ban as a \u201cbackward move\u201d for the protection of human rights in the country. In Gambia, 73% of women aged between 15 and 49 years had experienced FGM as of 2020, according to the United Nations. More than 65% of those women were subjected to the practice \u201cbefore the age of five years,\u201d the UN said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Women\u2019s Day in March that he was \u201coutraged\u201d by moves by Gambia\u2019s parliament to legalize FGM, describing the practice as \u201chorrific.\u201d Despite the ban, FGM has still been performed on children in parts of the country.

{"id": "2024_07_14_americas_venezuela-migrants-maduro-biden-intl-latam", "text": "A small corner of Venezuela is spreading slowly along 77th\u00a0Street in Bogota, the capital of Colombia. Municipal maps formally refer to that neighborhood as\u00a0Unir II (\u201cunite\u201d), but to many of its inhabitants it is known as Barrio Hugo Chavez, after the late Venezuelan president. Many of the more than seven million Venezuelans who fled their country over the past decade or more now call Bogota home. The city is brimming with informal communities where migrants come together to help each other integrate and combat the ever-present melancholy and homesickness. Maria Alvarez is one such migrant. A 27-year-old single mother from Valencia, Alvarez left Venezuela in 2017 when her son Gabriel was only one. They haven\u2019t returned since. Gabriel knows his grandparents only from the photos on his mother\u2019s phone and the occasional video call. \u201cEveryone left\u2026 I\u2019ve got family in Brazil, the US, here in Colombia, in Ecuador, in Chile too. We are all abroad: uncles, aunts, cousins\u2026 only my mom and my dad, and one of my brothers remain in Venezuela,\u201d Alvarez told CNN. Most of those seven million migrants left Venezuela after 2014, according to the United Nations, amid an economic and political crisis brought about by a crash in the price of oil \u2013 a key export for Venezuela \u2013 combined with chronic corruption and mismanagement at the hands of government officials. Almost two million of them have been granted work permits to work in Colombia, where life is working out well for Alvarez and many others like her. After the Covid pandemic, she helped create a foundation in\u00a0Unir II\u00a0to provide Venezuelans and Colombians with professional classes and psychological counseling. She now makes a living as a manicurist and has met a new partner. Even so, she still feels the draw of Venezuela. \u201cI just dream of going home and building a life there. Colombia has been good, I feel welcome here, but well, I long to go back,\u201d she told CNN, tearfully. An election and a credible opposition But with the authoritarian government of Nicolas Maduro firmly ensconced in power, for many years those dreams of returning have remained just that. Until now. This month, for the first time in a decade, Venezuela will hold an election in which Maduro\u2019s government is being challenged by an opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, who has a credible chance of winning. In October last year, Maduro formally pledged to grant free and fair elections in 2024 at the end of a long and secretive negotiation process with the US State Department. That pledge was at least partially compromised amid a new spat between Washington and Caracas: the leading opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, was barred from running earlier this year, as was her immediate replacement Corina Yoris. The Venezuelan government has accused the White House of not lifting all economic sanctions against government officials, and in recent weeks opposition supporters and members of Machado\u2019s team have been detained. Even so, many experts believe that come the July 28 election the opposition has a real chance of pushing Maduro out of power. Recent polls put Gonzalez more than twenty percentage points ahead of Maduro and, for the first time in years, electoral observers from the Carter Center and the UN have been invited to monitor the election. Such a lead would make Gonzalez the heavy favorite if this were almost any other democratic country. Yet in Venezuela, the government has a habit of clinging to power. Critics have long accused it of rigging votes and silencing the opposition. Opposition protests were repeatedly repressed in 2014, 2017 and 2019, and hundreds of opposition leaders have been arrested, or exiled. Still, to many, this year feels different. \u201cI personally find it difficult to believe Maduro will just give up power,\u201d said Laura Dib, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America. \u201cHowever, you know, if there\u2019s massive participation with international observation and, of course, with pressure from inside the government itself and international pressure\u2026 that could create some avenues,\u201d she told CNN. Alvarez and many other migrants in Bogota, think similarly: \u201cMaduro can only win the election if he steals it. But if there\u2019s a new government, I\u2019d go back the same day. Not just me, hundreds, thousands\u2026 there won\u2019t be enough planes for everyone to return home,\u201d said Endel Gonzalez, a 54-year-old from Maracaibo who has worked as a food courier in Bogota for the past five years. What it means for America It\u2019s the fate of migrants like Alvarez and millions of others like her that are making this such a closely watched election. Before the pandemic, it was common for Venezuelan migrants to seek opportunities in neighboring countries, but in the past three years more than half a million have headed to the United States\u2019 southern border, moving directly via land from Colombia to Panama and Central America, all the way to Northern Mexico. Venezuelans were the second largest group of migrants apprehended by US Customs and Border Patrol in 2023, totaling over 260,000 encounters, a fivefold increase\u00a0from 2020\u00a0when there were less than 50,000,\u00a0putting pressure on the White House to stem the flow. With the Democratic administration facing an uncertain election in November and migration policies squarely on the ballot, this month\u2019s contest in Caracas could hold profound consequences for US President Joe Biden. Most experts who spoke to CNN believe that if Gonzalez wins, many migrants will decide to return to Venezuela \u2013 but if Maduro clings to power, even more will be tempted to head to the US border, both for political reasons and practical ones. In the early years of Venezuela\u2019s migration boom, many Latin American countries offered emergency permits and ad hoc policies for migrants from the country, but now many are erecting barriers to deter the free movement of people. Colombia for example has stopped issuing documents for recently arrived migrants, while the newly elected president of Panama, Jose Raul Mulino, has proposed fencing off the jungles that connect his country to Colombia. Dib estimates that up to two million more migrants could be on the move by next year. What next? The Biden administration has been instrumental in reaching this moment. Maduro\u2019s agreement to a free and fair election came only after the US partially lifted oil sanctions, and only after repatriation flights for undocumented migrants back to Caracas resumed in October. Direct negotiations between Maduro and the State Department seem to have halted, although Maduro announced last week that his chief negotiator, Jorge Rodriguez, held a meeting with US officials to resume talks. Washington is openly supporting Gonzalez, apparently reasoning that a transition to democracy in Venezuela would not only help negotiations around energy policy and migration, but also help turn Caracas from its ideological alliances with the likes of China, Russia and Iran. But with both countries going to the polls this year, it may be what voters decide in November, rather than July, that really makes the difference. \u201cIf the Biden administration remains in power, I believe (bilateral) negotiations will continue,\u201d Dib said. \u201cNow, if there\u2019s a Trump administration, most likely it\u2019s just conducting business\u2026 without much regard on what happens in terms of democracy and human rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/americas/venezuela-migrants-maduro-biden-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Thirty-three Indian farm laborers were allegedly forced to work more than 10 hours a day, seven days a week, for wages of around $4 an hour that were sometimes withheld, a statement from the police said. The police spokesperson said they also confiscated more than $500,000 in cash and other assets from two Indian nationals suspected of being the gangmasters. The money is believed to be tied to the alleged \u201csale\u201d of the workers as \u201clow-cost labor,\u201d they said. This comes as Italian authorities were investigating the death of a 31-year-old Indian national who died after his arm was severed in an accident at a fruit farm in June. The 33 freed workers were lured to Italy by Indian \u201cbrokers\u201d who worked with traffickers in promising people legitimate jobs, the spokesperson said. The workers had each paid more than 17,000 euros (around $18,500) for travel and for what turned out to be fake seasonal work permits to enter the country, according to the spokesperson. Many of the workers were charged an additional 13,000 euros (around $14,100) in a promise of permanent work permits, according to the police statement. \u201cTo guarantee their total silence and submission, the two Indian subjects took away the passports of the laborers as soon as they arrived in Italy and imposed on them an absolute ban on leaving the dilapidated \u2018houses\u2019 in which they were forced to live under threat, several times implemented, of physical retaliation in case of refusal,\u201d the police statement said. The identities and genders of the freed workers have not been made public. The financial police said they are now investigating the business relationships the suspected gangmasters had with other entities, including many companies who used the \u201clow-cost labor.\u201d On Saturday, the Indian embassy in Rome said on X that it was \u201caware of media reports about Indian nationals working in agricultural farms in Italy.\u201d \u201cWe are in contact with Italian authorities and the Indian community to ensure safety and well being of Indian nationals,\u201d it added. Italy has a complicated history with labor trafficking. In 2018, the financial police said that at least a quarter of all agriculture related labor was tied to a gangmaster system whereby farm and other labor workers are contracted out by individuals who \u201cown\u201d them. The practice has been illegal since 2016 after a female laborer working under slave-like conditions for little money died. More than 11 percent of all workers in Italy work in the black market, meaning they are not documented even if they are Italian nationals, and neither they nor their employees pay taxes on the salaries, which serves to enable labor trafficking, according to the police spokesperson.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/asia/slave-conditions-indian-workers-italy-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_world_south-korea-north-korea-defector-day-hnk-intl", "text": "In the shadow of what looks like Seoul\u2019s colossal chrome space station, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, hundreds of defectors from North Korea gathered for lively celebrations on Sunday marking the first nationwide North Korean Defectors\u2019 Day. The inaugural event, declared by the government to be held each July 14, recognizes approximately 34,000 North Koreans who escaped the authoritarian grip of Pyongyang to resettle in the South \u2013 leaving behind legacies of fear, deep familial ties, and days devoted to a repressive regime often seen as frozen in time. The joy of freedom marked the celebration on Sunday, the thunderous tempo from massive drums declaring a spirited independence from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The echoes of well-known North Korean songs celebrating friendship spilled into nearby neighborhoods, as families filled booths\u00a0serving\u00a0both North and South Korean treats such as the deep-fried confection yakgwa, and fruit punch, or hwachae. The lively celebrations in the heart of South Korea are particularly significant given the difficulties defectors often face once they arrive \u2013 with many struggling to assimilate, and a rare few even risking their lives to return to the hermit nation. Among the problems they face are financial hardship, discrimination and deep stigma among South Koreans against defectors. Activists and authorities hope this new annual celebration will help to change that. \u201cThis is something that we all have to celebrate,\u201d said Park Daehyeon, a defector who fled North Korea in 2006 and has since founded the non-profit organization Woorion to help other defectors resettling in the South. Defectors flee the North and come to the South \u201cto be very meaningful to society, and also contribute to this South Korean society, and also (are) supporting their friends and family left behind in North Korea,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, this is a date (where) we all have to embrace and support each other, recognize each other, and appreciate the diversities and different experiences we have.\u201d The perilous journey south Since the\u00a0Korean War ended with an armistice in 1953, North and South Korea have been separated by an almost impenetrable border preventing anyone from crossing to the other side. Over subsequent decades, South Korea has modernized, becoming one of the world\u2019s richest and most technologically developed countries. Meanwhile, North Korea has become increasingly isolated, with the vast majority of citizens subject to widespread poverty and limited basic freedoms. Over the years, thousands of defectors have fled \u2013 often enlisting brokers who arrange their transport and route across the tight borders, traveling through China and other parts of Asia before arriving in Seoul and other final destinations. It\u2019s a dangerous journey. Many North Korean women are trafficked and sexually exploited in China, where a gender imbalance has created a black market for brides. And there are few ways out for these victims: China considers North Korean refugees to be economic migrants, and forcibly deports them back \u2013 where, as alleged defectors, they face imprisonment, possible torture or worse, activists say. Even those who safely make it to South Korea face an uphill battle \u2013 especially in finding jobs and earning a living, even with vocational training and financial support from the government. Some\u00a06.1% of defectors\u00a0were unemployed in 2022, more than double the national rate, according to\u00a0government figures. Then there\u2019s the culture shock \u2013 and sometimes, hostility from South Koreans. On news stories online, \u201cYou can find people saying, \u2018Hey, you need to go back to where you come from,\u2019\u201d said Park, the Woorion founder. \u201cI wish society is more open (to) new defectors. Maybe there (are) many thousands of thousands of North Korean defectors who want to come to (South) Korea and have a prosperous life. If the society doesn\u2019t (welcome) them \u2026 they are kind of lost.\u201d At the celebration on Sunday, Kwon Ji-hwan, who fled North Korea in 2015, did free drawings for visitors and told CNN he was \u201cvery grateful\u201d for the event. \u201c[If I were still in North Korea] I think I would have been having a difficult life working as a laborer, perhaps at a construction site,\u201d he said. \u201cBut since coming to South Korea, I can live freely while drawing what I like, so that\u2019s what makes me happiest.\u201d However, he said, he wished new arrivals could receive more comprehensive education so they become self-sufficient rather than relying on government benefits. On Sunday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol invited a group of defectors to the Blue House, the former presidential residence, where he offered encouragement and support to the community. \u201cWe express our respect and applause to the 34,000 North Korean defectors who are pioneering new lives every day (in South Korea), he said. \u201cAll of you are living witnesses of the noble journey toward freedom.\u201d Yoon promised to increase resettlement funds for defectors, and to incentivize government agencies and state-run companies to hire more defectors by offering tax benefits. Mixed welcome Other defectors attending the festival on Sunday had mixed reactions \u2013 some appreciating the gesture, others reminiscing about their home across the heavily militarized border, and others yet unsure if the event would truly serve to unify people. One defector, who CNN is not naming for their privacy and safety, ate rice cakes at a booth at the Seoul festival. They \u201ctasted like what I used to have in my hometown,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years since I came to South Korea, but I still miss the taste of my hometown and have a hard time getting used to the South Korean-style food.\u201d She worried that the annual Defectors\u2019 Day created a \u201cdivision between us and South Koreans and it felt like we were not being accepted as fellow Koreans.\u201d However, she added, she understood the government\u2019s intentions, and hoped it would become \u201can opportunity for harmony and understanding each other.\u201d One attendee, Han Bong-hee, told CNN that she wasn\u2019t sure if she would still be alive had she stayed in North Korea. Since arriving in the South 24 years ago, she now practices as a traditional medicine doctor. \u201cI am very satisfied with my life now because I came to South Korea, found a job, and am living happily while enjoying freedom,\u201d she said. Another female defector who left North Korea in 2016 expressed gratitude for the celebration. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that a day like Defectors\u2019 Day would happen, but now that it has been established, I feel like I have to work harder,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to live and work harder knowing that there are people in the government who are trying to help us.\u201d There are many success stories of defectors who have become entrepreneurs, academics and professionals, said Park, the Woorion CEO. He pointed to himself as an example, saying he\u2019d struggled when he was younger \u2013 but \u201cnow I am able to speak to foreigners and (am) experiencing different cultures and traveling all over the world.\u201d \u201cThis is something that we all North Korean defectors want, and that 25 million North Korean people want,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is freedom we are enjoying, and this must be given to everybody.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/world/south-korea-north-korea-defector-day-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

However, he says he felt uneasy about the prospect of flying his family in an older aircraft that he wasn\u2019t familiar with, and didn\u2019t think it would be a \u201ccomfortable journey.\u201d Aliseril began to look into the possibility of building a plane himself, reasoning that this would allow him to gain a better understanding of the aircraft so that it would be easier to maintain in the long term. After researching self-assembly aircraft kits, he came across a four-seater plane manufactured by South African company Sling Aircraft that ticked all the right boxes. In January 2020, Aliseril flew to the Sling Aircraft factory facility in Johannesburg for the weekend in order to take the\u00a0Sling TSi aircraft\u00a0on a test flight and was so impressed that he decided to purchase it. \u201cThis was pre-Covid, where travel was still very easy at the time,\u201d he explains. \u201cI ordered the first kit when I got back. And by the time it arrived, the UK was in full lockdown.\u201d Aliseril says his colleagues, some of whom had experience with building aircraft, initially offered to help with the build. But the restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, which had spread across the world by this point, meant that this wasn\u2019t possible. Undeterred, he constructed a small shed in his back garden and planned out the different stages of the project, which would be monitored by the\u00a0Light Aircraft Association, a UK representative body that oversees the construction and maintenance of home-built aircraft, under an approval from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The rules for amateur built aircraft differ slightly from country to country. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has an\u00a0experimental airworthiness category\u00a0where special airworthiness certificates can be issued to kit-built aircraft. Amateur-built airplanes in the UK are investigated by the CAA, who will issue a \u201cPermit to Fly\u201d once satisfied that the aircraft is fit to fly. Although the start of the build was delayed slightly due to the Covid-19 restrictions in place in the UK at the time \u2013 the Light Aircraft Association inspector assigned to the project was required to visit his working space beforehand \u2013 Aliseril was able to begin in April 2020. While he notes that his engineering background helped in some ways, he believes that it was actually his home improvement experience that proved most useful while constructing the aircraft, which has a length of 7.175 meters and a height of 2.45 meters. \u201cThese aircraft kits are designed for any amateur to build, provided you\u2019re a bit hands-on and you\u2019ve got experience working with some specialist tools,\u201d he adds, describing the detailed \u201cIkea furniture type instructions\u201d with drawings that came with the kit. \u201cI would say generally, anyone can get involved in these sorts of builds.\u201d Lockdown project Aliseril completed the work himself, drafting in Abhilasha to assist with some of the sections that required more than one pair of hands. Their eldest daughter Tara, now nine, was on hand for tasks such as removing the plastic from each of the components. By the end of summer 2020, Aliseril had built the tail and the wings. He began constructing the fuselage section in October, when the next part of the kit arrived. Although he\u2019d initially planned to hire a workshop to construct the aircraft, Aliseril feels that creating a workspace at his home was the better choice. \u201cI could just step into the shed and work on it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo having everything just in the back garden really helped, even though space was tight.\u201d Each stage of the project had to be signed off by an inspector before he could move onto the next task \u2013 the Light Aircraft Association completed around 12 inspections in total. Once the majority of the components were constructed, and it was time to put the aircraft together, Aliseril moved everything from his home to a hangar near Cambridge for the final assembly and engine fit. The aircraft passed its final inspection a few months later. It was one of the first Sling TSi homebuilt aircraft constructed in the UK. G-Diya, named after his youngest daughter, was signed off for its first flight in January 2022. Aliseril recalls waiting on the ground anxiously as a test pilot took the plane he\u2019d spent 18 months building up into the air. \u201cHe took it up for about 20 minutes, and then he came back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a big relief. I couldn\u2019t lift my head up to see what was happening (during the test flight).\u201d That first flight was hugely significant in many ways. \u201cWith these build projects, everyone calls it a project until it\u2019s first flown,\u201d he explains. \u201cOnce it\u2019s flown, it\u2019s always called an aircraft. You never call it a project anymore. That\u2019s psychologically a big step.\u201d When it was time to fly the aircraft for the first time himself, Aliseril was accompanied by another experienced test pilot. While he admits to being decidedly cautious, the test pilot was \u201cthrowing the aircraft about as if it was a racing car.\u201d \u201cI was feeling very nervous, I didn\u2019t want to put any extra stress on it,\u201d Aliseril explains. \u201cBut (the test pilot) was really pushing it to the limits. And it was good to experience that. I know that (the aircraft) can handle this much. \u201cOnce I landed, (the test pilot) clapped his hands and said \u2018Congratulations, you\u2019ve just landed the plane you built.\u2019 That was a great feeling.\u201d G-Diya, which has a range of 1,389 kilometers, went through a number of further test flights before it was issued with a permit to fly in May 2022. The following weekend, Aliseril flew with his wife and daughters Diya and Tara, five, to the Isle of Wight, where they took a short taxi ride from the airfield to the beach. \u201cThe kids were really happy,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that sort of freedom. And the fact that we could just do that on a Saturday and still be back by 4 p.m. That was a great feeling.\u201d They continued taking trips together within the UK, flying to Skegness, a seaside town in eastern England and the village of Turweston in Buckinghamshire, before Aliseril felt comfortable enough to take them a little further afield. Last Easter, the family, who\u2019ve been documenting their trips on their\u00a0Instagram account, fly_home_or_away, traveled to Bergerac, France, which Aliseril describes as their \u201cmost memorable\u201d trip together. According to Aliseril, G-Diya has flown over 300 hours in the past two years, traveling as far as Norway. Family trips For Aliseril, one of the main benefits of the plane, aside from the freedom it provides him and his family, is the friendships he\u2019s formed with other pilots. He was always mindful that owning an aircraft could become a financial burden, but has been able to get round this by working out an arrangement to share it with three others. \u201cTo get your private license, it costs quite a bit,\u201d he adds, before noting that many of those who\u2019ve taken on similar projects are either retired, or are people \u201cwho have the time and financial status\u201d to fund the process. \u201cI kind of knew that from the beginning, and thought I\u2019d take that risk and try to do it myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew that once it was done, I would easily be able to find people to share that cost. And it\u2019s worked out quite well (for me).\u201d \u201cIt becomes a communal thing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always have somebody to fly with if your family is not available. Also, having other pilots who are friends \u2013 you learn from each other.\u201d Now that the aircraft is split equally between four people, \u201cit\u2019s only costing us around the price of an SUV,\u201d adds Aliseril. \u201cIt\u2019s more fuel-efficient in the air \u2013 it only takes about 20 liters of unleaded fuel per hour of flight,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the fuel costs are pretty much equal to driving.\u201d As for the cost of the build, the kit was priced at around \u00a380,000 (about $91,000,) according to Aliseril, while added costs including avionics, as well as the plane\u2019s Rotax engine, propeller and other supplies, brought the total up to around \u00a3180,000 (around $203,000). There was no hangar space at the airfields close to his home, so Aliseril decided to build a new hangar for the plane at an Essex airfield. The new hanger was completed in early 2023. Aliseril says he hopes that more young people will take on projects like this in the future, and points to shared aircraft ownership as a way to make things more cost-efficient, as well as form connections in the aviation world.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_china-emperors-food-beijing-forbidden-city-intl-hnk", "text": "The Forbidden City was once one of the most powerful places on the planet. In 1420, while Europe was in the midst of the Hundred Years\u2019 War and yet to discover America, China\u2019s Ming Dynasty ruler was moving into his new home in the center of Beijing and beginning to strengthen his grip on an expanding empire. Inside their vast palace, China\u2019s emperors were unassailable, protected not just by the miles of walls surrounding them, but by the extreme secrecy that governed the lives of the royalty within them. It was called the \u2018Forbidden City\u2019 because few Chinese subjects were allowed to enter. The last emperor was evicted in 1924. In the years that followed, as the world\u2019s largest palace complex began to open its doors to the outside world, the enigmas of even the darkest corners of the Forbidden City were exposed to daylight. But one topic remains murky, even today: Food. Decades after the fall of imperial China, even as historians continue to collaborate to examine China\u2019s past, very little is known about what was eaten in one the world\u2019s richest and most powerful households \u2013 especially in the early days, as most of the ancient documents that might offer insights into the topic have been sealed off because of their fragile state. Zhao Rongguang, a food historian from the northern Chinese province of Heilongjiang, is one of the last few people \u2013 and quite possibly the only person \u2013 to have accessed and thoroughly studied all of them before they were locked away. This puts him in the rare position of being able to debunk many of the myths about palace cuisine that have persisted for decades. Zhao began delving into the Forbidden City\u2019s culinary mysteries more than four decades ago. Beijing back in the 1980s was still a city of bicycles and backstreets \u2013 a far cry from the metropolis of skyscrapers and highways it is today. But it was also an exciting decade, as the country re-opened to the world \u2013 and Western culture \u2013 after leader Deng Xiaoping announced his \u201copen door policy\u201d in late 1978. It was the decade when Wham! became the first Western pop band to perform in China since 1949, and Paris\u2019 iconic Maxim\u2019s restaurant opened an outpost in Beijing. Zhao, now 76, wasn\u2019t distracted by these new trends. He had saved up money from his teaching job to travel to Beijing to pursue his mission to find out what China\u2019s ancient emperors and their families really ate. It wasn\u2019t an easy task. In his path were two main obstacles. Firstly, the enduring secrecies of the palace \u2013 so little had been revealed to those outside its towering red walls during the five centuries it was occupied. Secondly, he says, food wasn\u2019t considered a serious topic worthy of study in China, meaning documents focusing on what was eaten during the early days of palace life were scattered and scarce. Zhao persisted, returning summer after summer to what was then called the First Historical Archives of China, in the old palace\u2019s Xihuamen, or West Prosperity Gate, where he pored over centuries-old imperial documents, which he believes were locked away in the 1990s. Slowly, he began to build up a picture of how dining in the Forbidden City evolved, zeroing in on three historical figures who were key to shaping royal eating habits. And now, nearly 40 years after he began his research, he has a pretty good idea. It all starts, Zhao tells CNN, with Kangxi, an emperor of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty that seized full control of China after 1644\u00a0when the Ming imperial family, aligned with China\u2019s majority Han ethnic group, was ousted. Under his rule, between 1661 and 1722, the country entered into a relatively peaceful era following decades of dynastic fighting \u2013 and that led to some interesting menu changes inside the Forbidden City. At first, after the Qing Dynasty initially moved in, traditional foods from the nomadic Manchu heartlands of northeastern China were on the table, according to documents from the era studied by Zhao. In the mid-Kangxi reign, royal diets began to evolve. \u201cThere was still a lot of roast game and unusual foods on Kangxi\u2019s table, like tiger testicles,\u201d says Zhao. Tiger testicles? \u201cYes, you heard me right, tiger testicles. Ancient people thought that they had a libido-boosting effect. I believe Kangxi had eaten plenty of them as it was recorded officially that Kangxi had hunted more than 60 tigers in his life.\u201d Rooster combs were another ingredient eaten as an aphrodisiac, says Zhao. But eventually, as society stabilized further during Kangxi\u2019s rule, more ethnic Han dishes began to appear in the mix of palace offerings, like duck gizzard stew. The Forbidden City\u2019s golden influencer The opaque world of Forbidden City dining gets a little clearer when we skip forward to Kangxi\u2019s grandson, an imposing figure known as Qianlong Emperor. During his nearly 61 years on the throne (1735-1796) \u2013 a time Zhao considers the second important phase of the Forbidden City\u2019s culinary evolution \u2013 Qianlong had his daily menus meticulously recorded, a paper trail that means historians can now reconstruct a more accurate view of the lifestyle in the palace at that time. Inside the Hong Kong Palace Museum, for instance, an ongoing exhibition titled \u201cFrom dawn to dusk: Life in the Forbidden City\u201d is heavily based on Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily rituals \u2013 meals included. \u201cSo what is the Forbidden City? It\u2019s a city. It is an institution. Just like any community, food culture was an indispensable part of the entire culture inside the Forbidden City,\u201d says Daisy Yiyou Wang, deputy director of the Hong Kong Palace Museum, a sister museum of Beijing\u2019s Palace Museum at the Forbidden City. \u201cThe food culture itself reflects so much of the identity of the people. Their status and power and authority, and their taste, and relationships as well.\u201d Among the exhibition\u2019s displays is a bulky silver milk teapot that dates to the 18th or 19th century, sitting between a gleaming gold wine ewer with cloud and dragon reliefs and a glass bowl bearing exquisite gold threads. The elaborately painted teapot, with its gilded golden dragons, suggests that milk tea, a Manchu meal staple, was an essential part of the royal court\u2019s diet during the Qing Dynasty. \u201cTea bricks would be broken into boiling water. Milk, butter and a pinch of salt were added. They then filtered the tea leaves out and then served the tea in this type of silver teapot,\u201d says Nicole Chiang, the Hong Kong Palace Museum\u2019s art historian and curator. The salted milk tea reflects the royal court\u2019s Manchurian roots. \u201cEven when Qianlong traveled to the Jiangnan region (south of the Yangtze River where modern-day Hangzhou and Shanghai are), he hired a milk tea master from Mongolia to prepare milk tea for the court every day.\u201d Chiang, who says she enjoys studying the Qing Dynasty due to the sheer number of historical artifacts preserved from that era, from texts to paintings, says the court also dined on hot pot - the traditional Chinese dish in which ingredients are cooked in a simmering bowl of soup stock right on the table. \u201cOne of the palace maids said that (the royal family) would have a hot pot dish almost every day for three months during wintertime. It was a popular dish,\u201d says the historian, pointing to an enamel hot pot from the Forbidden City on display at the Hong Kong Palace Museum. Chiang, currently preparing for a future exhibition on food and travel in the Forbidden City, notes that though Emperor Qianlong had his menus recorded, it\u2019s still challenging to study palace food history as most of the sealed-off documents have\u00a0not\u00a0been released to researchers and the public. (Her own exhibition is based on documents that have already been published by the Palace Museum.) As one of the few who have ever laid eyes on the archived documents, Zhao has had some of his research published in the last few decades. He continues to work and says he is now compiling a book based on all of his findings, which will further demystify the topic of palace cuisine. Through this wealth of knowledge, Zhao has been able to view the long-held beliefs about what was eaten inside the Forbidden City through a wider lens and add some much-needed context. And that includes the emperor\u2019s supposed love for hot pot. \u201cMenus were often presented to the emperor the night before for approval,\u201d he says. \u201cThey reflected the personal tastes of the emperor \u2013 but were not solely based on his preferences. So we know Qianlong Emperor had hot pots \u2013 which were mostly written as \u2018warm pots\u2019 in the records. It could be because of the weather and tradition but it might not mean Qianlong loved them.\u201d He says that in Qianlong Emperor\u2019s time, imperial cuisine was much more refined and diverse \u2013 with both traditional Manchu dishes like roasted Asian roe deers and pheasants \u2013 as well as southern dishes, especially from the Jiangnan region. \u201cThe game on his menus showcases his northern roots,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cOne of the dishes that appeared very often in his record was the Sika deer tail platter. The tail was quite a small part \u2013\u00a0but a wonderfully fat and fragrant part of a deer.\u201d Smoked red-braised duck, fried spring bamboo shoots with pork and bird\u2019s nest soup with rock sugar were some of the other regulars from the Jiangnan region that were frequently eaten in the Forbidden City. Qianlong Emperor, alongside other Qing Dynasty nobility, believed that bird\u2019s nest soup \u2013 made with the solidified saliva of swallows \u2013 was extraordinarily nutritious. So much so that researchers believe he downed a bowl of it every morning before breakfast. \u201cThere are many myths and legends about bird\u2019s nest. It was a relatively new ingredient at that time,\u201d Zhao explains, noting that it didn\u2019t appear in a major encyclopedia on traditional Chinese medicines published in the late 1500s. Based on the historical documents, Qianlong had two main meals per day. His breakfast was at around 6 a.m. and dinner at 2 p.m. But right after he woke up at 4 a.m., he would usually have a snack \u2013 such as bird\u2019s nest soup \u2013 before his morning meal and work. At night, as he went through reports and requests from all over the country, he\u2019d have another bite to eat at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. \u2013 often consisting of eight to 10 small dishes. \u201cHe usually dined alone except for the snack time at night, when he might be dining with a consort he was going to sleep with,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cTo dine and sleep well \u2013 so he could produce offspring \u2013 were also two main tasks for the emperor.\u201d Although being the ruler of the country did mean that he could enjoy the finest ingredients, he didn\u2019t always indulge. And both Zhao and the experts at Hong Kong Palace Museum agree that dining inside the Forbidden City wasn\u2019t as lavish as most people might assume. \u201cThe majority of (the emperors) grew up in a highly disciplined environment,\u201d says Wang of the Hong Kong Palace Museum. \u201cTheir diet was supposed to be healthy and to be studied by a lot of people already and tested by history.\u201d One of the biggest misunderstandings about dining in the Forbidden City, she says, is the assumption \u201cthat the emperors must eat like a million dishes, especially when you have that Manchu-Han Banquet rumor.\u201d The mythical Manchu-Han Banquet The myth of the extravagant Manchu-Han Banquet \u2013 often cited as an example of how the imperial family ate \u2013 was closely connected to Empress Dowager Cixi \u2013 a former royal concubine who controlled China ruthlessly for almost 50 years until she died in 1908. Cixi is largely responsible for the third and final stage of Zhao\u2019s Forbidden City culinary research, but to understand how she accidentally contributed to one of the biggest misunderstandings about Chinese foods in modern days, it\u2019s worth exploring the unique social and political situation in the decades leading up to China\u2019s re-opening in the late 1970s. It was a period of political and economic isolation for mainland China following the Communists\u2019 victorious emergence from a civil war in 1949. By accident, however, national culinary pride swelled toward one legendary banquet called the \u201cManchu-Han Feast\u201d (or Man Han Quan Xi), which first appeared outside of the Forbidden City in the late Qing Dynasty and was popularized at an expo in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in the 1950s. \u201cIn 1957, at the first China Import and Export Fair in Guangzhou, one vendor had a sumptuous banquet spread for display,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cOut of the few foreign countries who sent their representatives, Japanese businessmen were intrigued. Japan\u2019s economy happened to be recovering rapidly after World War II. They wanted to learn about this lavish feast and asked a staff member about what kind of feast it was. \u201cThe clueless helper then consulted the boss, also clueless, who asked the chef. The chef wasn\u2019t sure either \u2013 but he had to give some answers, so he said \u2018This is called the Manchu-Han Banquet and it was started by the emperor.\u2019\u201d The Japanese businessmen were said to have been fascinated. From then on, the Manchu-Han Feast became synonymous with emperors and their meals, and Zhao says it became one of the hottest food trends in Japan. Dozens of gourmets and research teams traveled to communist China to find out more about this mysterious imperial diet that technically didn\u2019t actually exist. \u201cWhile mainland China didn\u2019t want to export such capitalistic ideals internationally originally, Hong Kong restaurateurs saw it as a great business opportunity,\u201d says Zhao. (In those days, Hong Kong was under British rule.) In 1978, a Japanese TV station worked with a Hong Kong restaurant to recreate and live-broadcast a massive Manchu-Han feast. The epic banquet was separated into four meals over two days. That only served to deepen the myth, leading people to mistakenly believe the emperor\u2019s feasts had to have 108 dishes spread across two days. After the country\u2019s re-opening, proud chefs in mainland China soon began declaring they could do an even more opulent version of the feast \u2013 one of them featured 1,080 dishes in one banquet, says Zhao. The fascination with this mystified imperial Chinese cuisine spread across East Asia like wildfire. Not even Zhao was immune from it. \u201cThat\u2019s why I decided to go find the truth myself,\u201d says Zhao, noting the banquets are what got him curious about Forbidden City cuisine in the first place. Empress Dowager Cixi\u2019s lavish meals So where does Empress Dowager Cixi fit into all this? Being the real holder of power behind the last few emperors of imperial China before her death, she was known for her extravagant lifestyle and appetite for exquisite Han Chinese foods. \u201cIt was the most lavish era during the Qing Dynasty. Their daily meals had increased from 18 to 23 courses to 25 to 28 courses,\u201d says Zhao. She was also a keen entertainer, hosting regular ceremonial feasts. While there were no official Manchu-Han Banquets, there were other types of imperial feasts held in the Forbidden City throughout the centuries. None of them had as many dishes as the rumors claimed. The most iconic format of them all was \u201cTian An Yan\u201d (translated as Increase Peacefulness Banquet), combining two main types of banquets of the past \u2013 the roast meat-heavy Manchu-style feasts and the Han style with bird\u2019s nest soup and seafood. \u201cBird\u2019s nest-style feasts featured many kinds of rare seafood products like shark fins, sea cucumbers, dried scallops and fish lips. Roast meat usually meant roast pork and roast duck,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cIt was an invention during her time with strict guidelines. Each of these banquets consisted of two hot pot dishes, four big bowls (main dishes with auspicious words written on them), four small bowls of items, six food plates, two platters \u2013 like sliced Peking duck or suckling pig, four types of pastries and bao, one type of noodles, one type of soup and one fruit platter. \u201cHence, even the highest form of Tian An Yan during that time had around 28 dishes at best \u2013 a far cry from the 108 dishes modern media like to portray,\u201d says Zhao. In a society with an increasing reputation for debauchery under Cixi\u2019s corrupt government towards the end of imperial China, wealthy patrons began creating their own \u201cimperial banquets\u201d inspired by Tian An Yan, and called them \u201cManchu-Han Banquets.\u201d This helps explain some of the confusion surrounding their connection to China\u2019s emperors. How hunger led Zhao to food history Despite having studied food for decades, Zhao is far from being a foodie. Quite the opposite, in fact \u2013 he says his obsession with food history stems from horrors he witnessed during his childhood in the three years of famine that followed the Communist leadership\u2019s Great Leap Forward economic policy in the late 1950s. \u201cThe memory of long-term gastrointestinal cramps due to hunger and the shock of the millions of deaths due to hunger in the 1960s are a nightmare that comes back and haunts me from time to time,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I survived and it deeply affected my perspective on food.\u201d Because of this, he says he believes understanding the past will improve the world\u2019s future food security. \u201cStudying food history is a part of understanding our food culture in a truthful way,\u201d Zhao says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t only help a country promote its culinary arts but helps us reflect on food and the policies we have today. Who doesn\u2019t enjoy good food? But I didn\u2019t become a food historian to indulge but out of consciousness and responsibility, I want to firmly grasp the truth about it. Today is a continuation of yesterday so studying history is an important part of who we are today and in the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/china-emperors-food-beijing-forbidden-city-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The two men standing against him \u2013 Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana \u2013 said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame\u2019s overwhelming victory was all but certain. Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end\u00a0the 1994 genocide in\u00a0Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy. Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening. Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed. Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stability candidate. His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of\u00a0supporting rebels\u00a0in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 a charge he has also denied. Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling center in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent. \u201cWe voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,\u201d Pheneas said. \u201cI voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.\u201d Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen. \u201cI voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,\u201d Vedaste said. The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame\u2019s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents. Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress. \u201cWe toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,\u201d Habineza said after voting. \u201cWe have to maintain this momentum and not regress,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are confident, each of us is confident, it\u2019s half and half,\u201d independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote. The US State Department says on its website\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0has made \u201cprogress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation.\u201d It also says it backs\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0efforts to \u201cincrease democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/rwanda-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Authorities said Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, \u201clured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies,\u201d of which only nine have been recovered. He was arrested in Soweto, east of the capital Nairobi, at 3 a.m. local time on Monday, outside a club where he had gone to watch the Euro 2024 soccer final, Kenya\u2019s director of criminal investigations,\u00a0Mohamed Amin,\u00a0told journalists on Monday. \u201cOn interrogation, the suspect confessed to having lured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies at the dumping site, all murdered between 2022 and Thursday, 11 July, 2024,\u201d Amin said. Acting police inspector general, Douglas Kanja, added in a statement that the \u201cpost-mortem examination is happening today\u201d on the nine bodies recovered so far. In a news conference on Sunday before the suspect\u2019s arrest, Kanja said the bodies \u201cwere severely dismembered, in different states of decomposition, and left in sacks.\u201d \u201cWe are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for life,\u201d Amin said Monday. Khalusha \u201cled officers to his single room rented house,\u201d which is located about 100 meters (328 feet) from the crime scene, Amin said. A machete, 12 nylon sacks, a pair of industrial rubber gloves, a hard drive, and eight smart phones were among \u201ccrucial\u201d items police said they discovered in the rented house. Amin said that, according to the suspect\u2019s confession, his first victim was his wife, whom he \u201cstrangled to death before dismembering her body and disposing it at the site.\u201d \u201cFrom his interrogation, all his victims have been murdered in like manner,\u201d he said. Khalusha\u2019s arrest followed \u201cforensic analysis of a mobile phone belonging to one of the victims, Josphine Mulongo Owino, where mobile money transactions conducted on the day she went missing pointed to the suspect,\u201d according to Amin.

The search for Kyle Clifford, 26, began on Tuesday evening when police were called to a house in Bushey, Hertfordshire, where they found three seriously injured women. Carol Hunt, 61, wife of BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, later died from their wounds, according to statements Wednesday from police and Britain\u2019s public broadcaster. A crossbow is believed to have been used in the \u201ctargeted incident,\u201d police said, adding that other weapons may also have been used. Clifford, who police warned may have been armed with a crossbow, was found in Enfield, North London on Wednesday afternoon, Hertfordshire Police said in a statement. \u201cA man wanted in connection with a triple murder in\u00a0Bushey\u00a0has been traced to a location in North London. Following an extensive search, Kyle Clifford, aged 26, was found in the\u00a0Enfield area by officers this afternoon (Wednesday, July 10),\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt this stage, we believe the suspect was known to the victims.\u201d The suspect is hospitalized in a serious condition and is yet to speak with officers, police said in an update Thursday. Clifford left the British army in 2022 after a short period of service, a source in the British defense ministry told CNN. He joined the forces in 2019 and served in the Household Cavalry, his former military boss told CNN. The killings sent shock waves through Britain, where mass murders are rare but violence against women has been labeled a national threat by the government. A woman is killed by a man every three days in the United Kingdom and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem, said earlier this year. \u201cEntrenched patriarchy at almost every level of society, combined with a rise in misogyny that permeates the physical and online world, is denying thousands of women and girls across the UK the right to live in safety, free from fear and violence,\u201d Alsalem said in February. \u2018Utterly devastating\u2019 The BBC\u00a0described the women\u2019s killings as \u201cutterly devastating\u201d in a statement to staff. The\u00a0broadcaster said it would give Hunt \u201call the support we can\u201d as part of a note sent to\u00a0BBC\u00a0Radio 5 Live staff. \u201cThe news today about John Hunt\u2019s family is utterly devastating,\u201d it said. \u201cOur thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\u201d British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper expressed her condolences following the killings. \u201cThe loss of three women\u2019s lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community,\u201d Cooper wrote on X Wednesday. \u201cI am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support Hertfordshire Police with any information about this case.\u201d A neighbor of the women said she \u201cwould see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\u201d according to PA Media. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad what\u2019s happened, very shocking,\u201d she added. In Britain, it is legal for a person to buy or own a crossbow if they are over 18, though anyone who carries one in public without a reasonable excuse can face imprisonment. In February, the previous government launched an eight-week review of the rules and the possibility of introducing a licensing scheme.

{"id": "2024_07_10_europe_russian-missile-strike-kyiv-hospital-un-intl-hnk", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s hospital likely took a direct hit from a Russian missile on Monday, a United Nations assessment has found, as NATO agreed to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s air defenses in the wake of the attack. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting the hospital in Kyiv and alleged, without evidence, that a\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0anti-aircraft missile caused the blast. But a UN human rights official said evidence suggested Moscow\u2019s forces were responsible for the deadly strike. \u201cAnalysis of the video footage and assessment made at the incident site indicates a high likelihood that the children\u2019s hospital suffered a direct hit rather than receiving damages due to an intercepted weapons system,\u201d Danielle Bell, head of the UN\u2019s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, told reporters Tuesday. Bell said the attack damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards at Kyiv\u2019s Okhmatdyt\u00a0hospital, which has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country, adding that Ukrainian officials have since transferred 600 children to other hospitals. \u201cThis terrible attack shows that nowhere is safe in Ukraine,\u201d Bell added. The UN assessment tallies with weapons experts, who told CNN that it was highly likely a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile struck the children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv on Monday. Reviewing video footage that CNN had verified and geolocated and images of fragments from the scene, weapons experts said that evidence strongly suggests the hospital was struck by a Russian cruise missile as opposed to a Ukrainian air defense projectile. Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told CNN Wednesday that the flight profile in the footage of the missile hitting the hospital is \u201cexactly correct for the Kh-101, with the right dive angle, under power and not tumbling or falling like a spent air-defence missile might.\u201d The silhouette of the rocket visible in the footage also matches the Kh-101, Bronk said. Two adults were killed in the strike and 16 others - including seven children - were injured, according to Ukrainian officials,\u00a0as Russia launched\u00a0a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0during morning rush hour, killing at least 43 people in total. The strikes across Ukraine were \u201cstrongly\u201d condemned by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, while the UN\u2019s human rights chief Volker Turk called for \u201cprompt, thorough and independent investigations\u201d into the attacks. The Russian attacks came as NATO leaders gathered in Washington, where the United States and NATO allies agreed to\u00a0give Ukraine more Patriot batteries and additional systems to strengthen\u00a0Kyiv\u2019s air defenses, members of the defense alliance said in a joint statement on Tuesday. US President Joe Biden also announced plans to supply new air defenses to Ukraine in a speech opening the NATO summit \u2013 providing much-needed support for the country at a critical juncture in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion. During his speech on Tuesday, Biden vowed that \u201cthe United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line.\u201d \u2018Targeted attack by Russia\u2019 Images and video from the aftermath of the strike on the Kyiv hospital show children with cancer being treated outside the facility and an injured toddler with blood on his face and arms. A\u00a0CNN team at the site\u00a0on Tuesday said the level of destruction\u00a0there\u00a0showed how forceful the explosion must have been. A pile of debris could be seen in place of where part of the facility once stood, while underneath a section of flooring lay the remnants of a car that was completely flattened when the building came crashing down. The UN\u2019s monitoring mission said it was likely that a KH-101 cruise missile launched by Russia struck the children\u2019s hospital. It made the determination \u201cbased on video footage, which shows the technical specification of the type of weapon that was used\u201d and that such footage \u201cshows the weapon directly impacting the hospital rather than being intercepted in the air,\u201d Bell said. A military expert who visited the site following the blast said the damage is \u201cconsistent with a direct hit,\u201d according to Bell. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Washington on Tuesday that\u00a0\u201cRussia always knows where its missiles hit. Always.\u201d On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia\u00a0reiterated Moscow\u2019s denial that it had targeted the children\u2019s hospital. \u201cWe have not bombed the children\u2019s\u00a0hospital,\u201d\u00a0Nebenzia\u00a0said\u00a0at a special meeting of the UN Security Council (UNSC) convened following the attack. \u201cIf this had been a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building at all.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_13_americas_avocado-cartel-us-mexico-intl-latam", "text": "When two US avocado inspectors were assaulted and detained at a police roadblock in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n last month, it sparked a costly international crisis. The US paused all avocado imports from the state for more than a week, leaving Mexican growers out of tens of millions of dollars and temporarily sending the price of a carton of the fruit in the US soaring by 40 percent, according to analysis firm RaboResearch Food & Agribusiness. Weeks later, after diplomats and agricultural officials from both countries negotiated new security guidelines around inspections, the massive cross-border trade has stabilized, with the US Department of Agriculture saying that export levels returned to normal at the beginning of July. But the episode underscored the precarious nature of the industry and the immense volatility in a region that provides most of the world\u2019s avocados, one of Mexico\u2019s most dangerous states and a nexus of cartel power. US and Mexican officials are now considering new changes to the strict processes that direct how the fruit can make its way to American kitchens to meet ever-increasing demand, with industry groups and advocates urging for more oversight. \u2018Green gold\u2019 Avocados, the creamy fruit with the industry nickname \u201cgreen gold,\u201d are big business. Of the amount exported from the nearly 2.7 million metric tons of the fruit grown last year in Mexico, 81 percent went to the US, at a value of $2.7 billion. Nearly three-quarters of Mexican avocados come from Michoac\u00e1n, a state along the country\u2019s Pacific coast with a volcanic belt running through it that makes its soil ideal for farming. The state\u2019s deepwater port has also been critical for the flourishing of drug cartels, which moved into Michoac\u00e1n in the 1980s, fueling a homicide rate that is today more than twice the national average. The expansion of the avocado market in the state around the same time has been \u201cdeeply intertwined\u201d with the violent groups and corrupt public authorities, researchers at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime said in a report this year. Citing interviews with growers in the state, the researchers described how criminal groups illegally burn and log protected forests and bribe local officials to change permissions around the use of the land to allow for commercial activity. According to an academic article published by the Mexican government cited in the report, 80 percent of the avocado orchards in Michoac\u00e1n were established illegally, \u201cinitially through unauthorized land use that was then turned into legal parcels thanks to corruption of public authorities.\u201d Cartels today also regularly extort producers in protection schemes, the report found. Local police forces in turn commonly rent themselves out as security for producers, and heavily armed militias known as \u201cautodefensa\u201d groups have formed to patrol farms. \u201cThis is the core of the mafia-style relationships that exist in Michoac\u00e1n around avocado production,\u201d Romain Le Cour, one of the report authors and a senior expert at the initiative, said in an interview. \u201cYou need criminal actors in a way to stir up the business, you need business entrepreneurs to run the business, and you need corrupt authorities to make sure that what you\u2019re doing becomes legalized or laundered.\u201d Mexican officials in the aftermath of the detention of the inspectors in June were quick to downplay the incident, claiming it was nonviolent and unrelated to organized crime and the inspectors\u2019 work in the avocado industry. The inspectors, who were Mexican citizens working for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, were stopped and taken from their car after attempting to cross a barricade on a highway set up by police officers who were protesting a pay issue, according to Alfredo Ram\u00edrez Bedolla, the Michoac\u00e1n governor. US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar has said, however, that the men were assaulted. The office of the Michoac\u00e1n state prosecutor told CNN last month that they\u2019ve opened an investigation into the incident. A dangerous job Since the US first allowed imports of avocados from Michoac\u00e1n in 1997, APHIS employees in the country have inspected avocado orchards to ensure they are free of pests that could harm US avocado crops. About 100 inspectors from the agency operate within the state, according to Ram\u00edrez, visiting avocado groves and packing facilities to check the fruit before issuing a certification. That close contact and pivotal responsibility leaves them \u201cextremely exposed to corruption and violence,\u201d said Le Cour, the GI-TOC expert. In 2022, exports of Mexican avocados were similarly halted for several days after one of the US inspectors working in Michoac\u00e1n received a threatening phone call. In the wake of both incidents, Mexican leaders have pushed to change the bilateral agreement regulating the trade to allow for the Mexican government to take over the inspections, with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador criticizing the US decision to halt the export as \u201carrogance.\u201d In a news conference last month, Mexican Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos said the Mexican government was \u201cperfectly prepared\u201d to do the work, which he said would be valuable to \u201cavoid having to stop the export.\u201d Officials at the US State Department and USDA have considered the possible change, according to Ken Melban, the vice president for industry affairs and operations at the California Avocado Commission, which represents growers in the state. In a statement, Melban called it \u201cunimaginable the US government would consider abdicating inspection responsibilities to Mexico.\u201d Such a change, he told CNN, would leave him doubtful of the integrity of certifications that the exported avocados are actually pest-free. \u201cUS farmers will not be protected under such a program, one intended and designed specifically to protect US farmers\u2019 economic interests,\u201d he said. An APHIS spokesperson declined to comment on the thinking around the policy. US and Mexican officials have also recently resurfaced discussions around a policy to block the export of avocados from Mexico grown in orchards on illegally cleared lands, according to Brad Adams, the executive director of Climate Rights International, an advocacy group that used satellite imagery last year to document the widespread deforestation behind the market. Leaders in both countries have voiced support for such a policy, but have so far been unable to decide on a legal mechanism to enact it. In a letter this spring to a group of US senators who had pushed for the change, the USDA noted that its inspectors don\u2019t have the regulatory authority to certify around the issue, according to a copy obtained by CNN. Instead, the agency pointed towards training and technical assistance that the US Forest Service has provided to Mexico \u201cto support real-time deforestation monitoring of priority regions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve exposed something that is illegal and therefore indefensible,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey have an obligation that they recognize at a governmental level in Mexico, and the US can\u2019t keep importing illegally harvested produce.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/americas/avocado-cartel-us-mexico-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The seat meant it could attend OpenAI\u2019s board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors. The observer seat and Microsoft\u2019s more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the US over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.

EU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc\u2019s merger rules\u00a0because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement. In contrast, the\u00a0British\u00a0and US antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft\u2019s influence over OpenAI and the latter\u2019s independence. Microsoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns. Additionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection\u2019s CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/tech/microsoft-openai-board-observer-seat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra and former British prime ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were just some of the famous faces who flew in to Mumbai to attend the star-studded event. The wedding also attracted many of the biggest names in Indian entertainment, sport, business and politics, from Bollywood stars like Rajinikanth and Sanjay Dutt, to former president Ram Nath Kovind, the chief ministers of various states and numerous members of the country\u2019s revered cricket team. No expense was spared by the Ambanis, the family behind India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. In a rain-soaked Mumbai, police closed roads in the area surrounding the Ambani-owned, 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Center ahead of a red-carpet-style arrival event. Attendees dressed the part, streaming past photographers in custom sarees, lehengas and kurtas at an event that may set forthcoming trends in Indian wedding fashion. International guests also honored the traditional dress code, with many seen wearing designs by major Indian fashion designers. John Cena walked the red carpet in an embroidered sky blue sherwani and white pants, while Jonas sparkled in a\u00a0baby pink version \u2014 made from a boucl\u00e9-style woven fabric embedded with sequins\u00a0\u2014 and matching satin trousers. Jonas arrived with his wife and actor, Priyanka Chopra, who opted for an intricately embellished sunshine yellow lehengai. The fashion crowd were out in full force too. Zendaya\u2019s longtime stylist Law Roach arrived in a mauve velvet jacket, purple tunic and a pair of Schiaparelli gold toed shoes, while designer and New York Fashion Week staple Prabal Gurung wore a rose-colored sherwani and aviator sunglasses. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, who skipped the red carpet entirely, were seen on social media dressed in gold and red saris respectively. Kim\u2019s ensemble featured an off-the-shoulder tasseled bodice, whereas Khlo\u00e9 opted for long, ornate sleeves, stacked necklaces and an opulent maang tikka. In an Instagram story, Kim teased that their film crew was in tow for an episode of their show \u201cThe Kardashians.\u201d Once inside the venue, which was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, celebrities including Chopra and Cena were seen dancing and letting loose. Footage widely shared on social media also showed members of the Ambani family dancing on stage with Indian singer, Daler Mehndi. The night\u2019s other performers included Afrobeats star Rema, who performed his hit song \u201cCalm Down.\u201d As for the couple itself, the groom first arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers, which he later changed for the ceremony. The bride dazzled in hand-embroidered bridal couture by the Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Merchant followed the Gujarati tradition of wearing red and white in an opulent red-trimmed ivory ensemble. It featured a 16-foot-long veil adorned with stones and sequins and a long ghagra, or traditional skirt, with a nearly seven-foot-long detachable train, according to her stylist Rhea Kapoor, who shared a first look on Instagram. Ahead of her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their\u00a0relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family, Merchant changed into an\u00a0opulent red and gold outfit\u00a0featuring a woven blouse, lehenga, veil and embroidered\u00a0head covering. In a video posted to social media on Friday morning, Anant\u2019s mother Nita Ambani recounted a recent trip to Varanasi, in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state, where she sought blessings for the pair. She said she hoped to \u201creimagine and present the purity, positivity and beauty of Varanasi at the wedding,\u201d adding that the event would \u201cpay a tribute to India\u2019s glorious culture and heritage, brought to life by thousands of artisans\u2026 weavers and craftspeople.\u201d It was also revealed that the gown Nita Ambani wore on the event red carpet took more than 40 days to create. The custom peach silk ghagra was designed by couture house Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and artisans Vijay Kumar and Monika Maurya. A lavish affair The Ambani family has remained tight-lipped about proceedings in the build-up to Friday\u2019s wedding, though rumors about the guest list and the identity of star performers have swirled in recent weeks. Local press and Indian social media users have also pored over speculation over everything from the dinner menu to the items of jewelry that might be on display from the family\u2019s sizable collection. One of India\u2019s best-known fashion designers, Manish Malhotra, served as the event\u2019s creative director. The celebrated couturier produced bespoke outfits for various members of the Ambani family throughout the month-long wedding celebrations. \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event \u2026 is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he told CNN via e-mail ahead of the wedding. In the days leading up to Friday\u2019s ceremony, the couple took part in several traditional pre-wedding rituals. Justin Bieber performed at the pair\u2019s \u201csangeet,\u201d a night of music and dance, last Friday. The couple then attended a private \u201chaldi\u201d ceremony, which traditionally sees friends and family bless the bride and groom by applying a turmeric paste to their heads, faces or bodies. As per Hindu tradition, the wedding dates were reportedly chosen according to auspicious days on the bride and groom\u2019s birth charts. A Brown University graduate, 29-year-old Anant Ambani is Mukesh\u2019s youngest child and serves as director at an energy business operated by Reliance. His bride Radhika Merchant, also 29, is the daughter of Viren and Shaila Merchant, the founders of pharmaceutical company Encore Healthcare. It is not known precisely how much money the Ambani family has spent on the pair\u2019s wedding celebrations. Industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars, with musical performers reported to be receiving seven- or even eight-figure sums. On the streets of Mumbai, residents spoken to by Reuters had mixed feelings about the extravagant event \u2014 and the wealth on display. \u201cIt\u2019s their wealth but it is beyond ridiculous what they are doing,\u201d said preschool teacher Devanshi Zaveri, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to show off that much.\u201d Banker Jenica Kothari meanwhile welcomed the boost to local businesses: \u201cIt\u2019s helping the economy, it\u2019s helping everyone\u2026 So, I think if they have the money, they should spend it.\u201d Local hotel rates reportedly soared as the thousands of guests prepared to jet to Mumbai, a financial hub that serves as India\u2019s commercial capital. Months of celebrations Festivities are set to continue through the weekend at the Ambani family\u2019s soaring 27-story Mumbai residence, Antilia. Saturday is expected to see a \u201cShubh Ashirwad,\u201d or divine blessings ceremony, while a Sunday reception (with an \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code) will give guests a final chance to celebrate with the couple. The weekend schedule concludes seven months of build-up to what has been described as India\u2019s wedding of year. Celebrations kicked off with a celebrity-filled engagement party in January. Two months later, the Ambanis hosted a communal dinner for more than 50,000 villagers and a 1,200-guest pre-wedding bash \u2014 attended by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump \u2014 featuring a rare live performance by Rihanna. In May, the family then chartered a cruise ship to take guests on a four-day trip around the Mediterranean. The schedule included multiple stops through Europe and on-deck concerts from the Backstreet Boys and Pitbull, among others. Anant\u2019s older sister, Isha, also held a lavish wedding in 2018.

The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said the families of the observers \u2013 Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev \u2013 have decided to allow the publication of photos taken during their first days being held by the militant group. \u201cThe images reveal them bruised and wounded from the horrific abduction that the entire world witnessed,\u201d the forum said. In the pictures, Levy appears to have a badly bruised right eye. Another image shows four of the women sitting on bedding in a bare room; two of them, Gilboa and Ariev, have bandaged heads. \u201cThe courageous decision by the parents to reveal these photos aims to bring them closer to embracing their daughters,\u201d they said.

{"id": "2024_07_14_middleeast_hamas-commander-killed-khan-younis-intl", "text": "Israel has announced that a Hamas commander was killed in Saturday\u2019s strike on southern Gaza, but the fate of the major target, Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, remains uncertain. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Sunday that Rafe Salama, the head of the Khan Younis brigade and Deif\u2019s deputy, was \u201celiminated\u201d in the attack. According to the statement, Salama was \u201cone of the closest associates\u201d of Deif, as well as \u201cone of the masterminds\u201d of Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7. It remains unclear if Deif himself died in Saturday\u2019s strike. The Israeli military is verifying whether he was killed while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday it is uncertain whether he died. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said the strike killed at least 90 Palestinians  and injured 300 others in Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian zone. The UN\u2019s Scott Anderson described what he saw at a nearby hospital in the aftermath of the strikes as \u201cthe most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.\u201d An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the architects behind the\u00a0October 7 attacks. He has led the Palestinian militant group\u2019s armed wing for more than two decades. If his death is confirmed, Deif would be the highest profile Hamas leader killed since the war in Gaza began nine months ago. Israel has been seeking to dismantle Hamas following the October 7 attacks but with fighting ongoing and senior Hamas figures at large, that goal has seemed distant. Strike could help deal, Netanyahu claims Netanyahu told the Israeli Channel 14 network on Monday that it was still unclear whether the strike had killed Deif, but added that there were \u201cinteresting indications, I don\u2019t want to say something certainly before we receive more information.\u201d Asked whether the strike could put at risk a potential hostage release and ceasefire deal, Netanyahu insisted it would actually promote a deal. \u201cHamas is weak. The more you hit it, the more you push for a deal,\u201d he told the network. Netanyahu said that for months Hamas \u201cthought they were safe, [now] they see they\u2019re unsafe. The IDF forcefully entered the Philadelphi corridor [along the Egyptian border], conquered the Rafah crossing.\u201d \u201cThis pressure, along with the fierce diplomatic standing of the political echelon and myself over the things we demand, gradually makes them change, surrender, or at least become more flexible. Now we need to increase the pressure. The more pressure we apply, we will get a deal that releases the maximum number of living hostages during the first phase, and gets us closer to our goal of destroying Hamas.\u201d Netanyahu also said the IDF would remain along the Philadelphi corridor, which has been a contentious issue in the negotiations. \u201cThis has consequences, both diplomatic and security related advantages,\u201d he said. Israeli intelligence services said this past week they killed a total of 25 Hamas operatives involved in the October 7 attacks. Ronen Bar, the head of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, announced the figure during a meeting with commanders from the IDF\u2019s Southern Command and 162 Division held in Rafah on Saturday. Bar commended the results of the Shin Bet\u2019s \u201cintensified activity\u201d within Gaza. Meanwhile, a fresh Israeli airstrike that hit a UN agency school in a camp for displaced people in central Gaza on Sunday has killed at least 22 and injured more than 100 others, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza and officials at a nearby hospital.

{"id": "2024_07_13_middleeast_israel-gaza-netzah-yehuda-human-rights-abuses-investigation-intl", "text": "Former commanders of the Netzah Yehuda battalion, an Israeli military unit that has been accused by the United States of gross human rights violations against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank prior to October 7, have been promoted to senior positions in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and are now active in training Israeli ground troops as well as running operations in Gaza, a CNN investigation has found. Among CNN\u2019s findings was rare whistleblower testimony from a former soldier of the unit who described a command that encouraged a culture of violence, an issue identified by US State Department investigations. In April, the State Department said that it had determined five Israeli security units had committed gross violations of human rights prior to the outbreak of the war with Hamas in Gaza. The department said that four of the units had \u201ceffectively remediated,\u201d or reformed themselves, in the wake of those violations, but that it was still deciding whether to restrict US military assistance to the remaining unit: The Netzah Yehuda battalion, originally created to accommodate ultra-Orthodox Jews in the military. The news that the US might withhold assistance from the Israeli military unit triggered a furious response at the time from top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said: \u201cIf anyone thinks they can impose sanctions on a unit of the IDF, I will fight with all my strength.\u201d In a letter obtained by CNN, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told House Speaker Mike Johnson that the US was working with Israel \u201con identifying a path to effective remediation\u201d for the Netzah Yehuda battalion. The letter did not name the unit, but current and former US officials confirmed to CNN that Blinken was referring to Netzah Yehuda, which has been accused of a string of abuses in the occupied West Bank over the last 10 years, including in the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian-American man in 2022. Using facial recognition technology and other open-source techniques, CNN has found that three former commanders of the Netzah Yehuda battalion \u2013 who were in charge of the unit at the time of alleged abuses in the West Bank \u2013 have risen through the ranks of the IDF. CNN tracked these commanders by matching their faces to publicly available imagery over the years, ranging from photographs of military ceremonies to battlefield updates. CNN has spoken with a former member of the unit, who detailed instances of cruel and excessively violent treatment of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. The whistleblower said that commanders actively supported vigilante violence and that promoting them into senior IDF positions risked bringing the same culture to other parts of the military. \u201cA lot of us probably did not see Arabs, Palestinians in particular, as someone with rights \u2013 okay, like they\u2019re really the occupier of some of the land and they need to be moved,\u201d he said. The former soldier, who asked not to be named due to fears about his security, told CNN that the unit was well known for carrying out what he described as the \u201ccollective punishment of Palestinians.\u201d He gave an example of the battalion\u2019s forces assaulting a Palestinian village, going door-to-door with stun grenades and gas grenades as retribution for some local children throwing rocks. While he was in Netzah Yehuda, he said, the battalion\u2019s commanders played a key role in perpetuating a culture of violence, both by standing by as it happened and promoting it. Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the allegations of abuse by Netzah Yehuda, the IDF said that the battalion \u201coperates in a professional and ethical manner\u201d and that its soldiers and commanders \u201cact according to the orders and protocols expected of soldiers in the IDF.\u201d The IDF added that it investigates \u201cevery exceptional incident,\u201d and takes command and disciplinary measures against those involved when appropriate. It did not comment on the subsequent promotion of some commanders. In the course of its month-long investigation, CNN spoke with several current and former US officials, who revealed the intense frustrations within the Biden administration at the perceived special treatment that Israel receives from the US when it comes to addressing human rights violations by its security forces. The former US officials said the fact that Netzah Yehuda\u2019s former commanders have continued to be promoted through Israel\u2019s military ranks was a worrying result of America\u2019s inaction and could have devastating consequences. The US determined that four of the five Israeli units under scrutiny were remediated on the basis that Israel had taken steps to \u201cbring to justice\u201d responsible service members, according to an internal memo sent by the State Department to Congress and obtained by CNN. Israeli military veterans from Breaking the Silence, an anti-occupation advocacy group, told CNN that the IDF often scapegoats junior soldiers or officers, arguing that abuses are the fault of a few bad apples rather than reflective of institutional problems stemming from longstanding military practices or government policies. That approach should not meet the bar for effective remediation, US officials said. A State Department spokesperson told CNN that they do not discuss the circumstances of individual cases, but its experts had \u201cconcluded that several Israeli security force units were credibly implicated in gross violations of human rights (GVHRs),\u201d and that for four of those, the Israeli government had \u201ctaken effective steps to bring those responsible to justice.\u201d \u201cWe continue to assess reports of GVHRs by Israeli security forces, in accordance with the law, and all US security assistance to Israel is provided consistent with domestic and international law,\u201d the spokesperson added. Current and former US officials also told CNN that the five Israeli units were not the only ones the State Department had been examining. The special State Department panel had reached unanimous consensus at a working level that three additional units had been guilty of abuses prior to October 7, the officials said. Only Blinken or the Deputy Secretary of State can make a final determination on whether units remain eligible to receive US military assistance and it is unclear if the matter has come before them. The findings by the expert panel would have been enough to disqualify a military unit from any other country, the officials said. The incidents include the killing of Ahmad Jamil Fahd, who was allegedly shot by forces from the Israeli police counterterrorism unit, the Yamam, near Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, in May 2021; the killing of a Bedouin man identified as Sanad Salaam al-Harbad, who was allegedly shot by the Israel Border Police in the southern Israeli city of Rahat in March 2022; and the alleged rape of a 15-year-old boy by an interrogator from the Israeli Internal Security Forces at the Russian Compound (Moscobiyya detention center) in Jerusalem in January 2021. One US official CNN spoke with said these were among \u201cthe most flagrant abuses looked into.\u201d CNN reached out to the Israel Border Police and Shin Bet, the country\u2019s domestic security agency, for comment on the State Department\u2019s findings. Josh Paul, who as a former director in the State Department\u2019s political-military affairs bureau spent more than 11 years working on US defense diplomacy, security and weapons assistance before resigning in October 2023 over the transfer of arms to Israel, told CNN that there was \u201cnot even the slightest basis\u201d to suggest that the three further units identified to CNN \u2014 the Yamam, the Israel Border Police and Internal Security Forces connected to the Moscobiyya detention center \u2014 had done anything to reform. Paul had previously referenced the Moscobiyya rape allegation in an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, adding that a charity had drawn it to the attention of a State Department vetting panel he was on. The allegation was believed to be credible and raised with Israel\u2019s government, he said. \u201cAnd do you know what happened the next day? The IDF went in to the (charity\u2019s) offices and removed all their computers and declared them a terrorist entity,\u201d he told Amanpour. Two of the units have been linked to deadly incidents in the wake of October 7. The Yamam was involved in Israel\u2019s hostage rescue operation in Nuseirat refugee camp, in northern Gaza, on June 8, which freed four Israelis and, according to local health authorities, killed more than 270 Palestinians and injured over 700. The IDF has disputed those numbers, claiming that casualties from the operation were \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the casualty figures given by either side. Meanwhile, the Israel Border Police shot and killed a 3-year-old Palestinian girl in the occupied West Bank in January and a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in occupied east Jerusalem in March. The fact that the US has never imposed sanctions on any Israeli military unit shows \u201cthe lack of political will and moral courage to hold Israel accountable,\u201d Paul added. \u2018Culture of impunity\u2019 The US is by far the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, and its military assistance has helped shape Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza. But it has increasingly come under international pressure over its support as the war drags on. Nine months since Hamas militants killed around 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped more than 250 people, Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. US President Joe Biden has called for the war to end, and laid out a US-backed Israeli ceasefire proposal, but his administration has continued to supply Israel with billions of dollars\u2019 worth of weapons. Paul told CNN that Israel\u2019s prosecution of the war in Gaza would look far different if the US had enforced legislation known as the Leahy law. The 1997 law, named for former Sen. Patrick Leahy who authored the legislation, prohibits the US from providing assistance to any foreign security units that are credibly implicated in human rights violations. \u201cHad the US used the leverage that Leahy laws provide over the years to encourage the IDF to crack down on misbehavior and to snuff out its current culture of impunity, we would have seen at the very least a much stronger unit discipline (than what we see in Gaza right now) at a tactical level,\u201d said Paul, who was a member of the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum \u2013 created in 2020 to identify Israeli units that should be barred from receiving US aid. Under the Leahy law, in cases where an entire unit is designated to receive assistance, the State Department vets not only the unit but also its commander. Charles Blaha, the former director of the State Department\u2019s Office of Security and Human Rights, and also a former member of the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum, said that the panel pays \u201cspecial attention\u201d to commanders. \u201cThey set the tone for the units. When a commander from a tainted unit goes on to another unit, he can render the new unit ineligible for US assistance too,\u201d said Blaha, who retired from the State Department last year. \u2018Moral failure\u2019 The Netzah Yehuda battalion was created by the Israeli military in 1999 for ultra-Orthodox Jews, to accommodate their more stringent religious practices, like the separation of men and women. Since it was established, the battalion has also attracted religious nationalists from the West Bank settler movement, according to those familiar with the unit. It forms part of the Kfir Brigade, the largest infantry brigade in the IDF. One of the most shocking and widely reported incidents involving the Netzah Yehuda battalion was the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian-American man, who was detained in his home village of Jiljilya in the occupied West Bank in January 2022. Omar Assad was held gagged and with his hands tied for a period before being freed and left unresponsive by soldiers from the unit, according to an IDF investigation. An autopsy report determined that Assad had died from a heart attack after he was detained. The IDF investigation concluded that the incident resulted from \u201ca moral failure and poor decision-making on the part of the soldiers.\u201d Following the initial probe, the IDF said that it would reprimand the commander of Netzah Yehuda \u2013 Lt. Col. Mati Shevach \u2013 and remove the platoon commander and company commander from their positions, barring them from commanding roles for two years. But no criminal charges were brought against the soldiers, because the military said there was no causal link found between Assad\u2019s death and their conduct. The IDF referred CNN to its findings when questioned about Assad\u2019s death. Current and former US officials told CNN that the Assad case reflects a broader trend of the types of cases that the US examines. To date, the only incidents in which the US has implicated Israeli units in gross human rights violations were cases in which Israeli courts had already ruled. \u201cThe State Department has never made an independent determination of a gross violation of human rights by an Israeli unit. Ever,\u201d Blaha said. Speaking further about the special treatment that Israel gets from the US, he added: \u201cOf course, we treat Israel differently and that really undermines our human rights advocacy in the rest of the world.\u201d Shevach, Netzah Yehuda\u2019s commander at the time of Assad\u2019s death, was promoted to the role of deputy commander of the Kfir Brigade, which oversees Netzah Yehuda, soon after his two-year stint in charge of the ultra-Orthodox battalion ended in August 2022. And now, Shevach is training soldiers who are about to enter combat, according to an IDF press release and media reports. Shevach has been running drills for Israeli forces at the military\u2019s Urban Warfare Training Center, a mock city in Tze\u2019elim military base in the Negev desert, preparing them to go into Gaza. In an October interview with US broadcaster CBS at the center, Shevach explained how he was readying soldiers to fight Hamas, adding that \u201cthe major concern for most of the soldiers\u201d was that at a certain point they would get \u201can order that the war ends, and we didn\u2019t finish our mission.\u201d CNN put its findings on Shevach\u2019s career trajectory to Blaha, who said that it \u201cstrongly suggests that the types of tactics, the types of abuses, the type of violations that the Netzah Yehuda have committed are going to metastasize to the new units because if that person is in charge of training, he is going to promulgate the same lack of ethos regarding human rights.\u201d CNN found that two other commanders who oversaw Netzah Yehuda \u2013 also known as the 97th Battalion of the Kfir Infantry Brigade \u2013 at the time of alleged abuses in the occupied West Bank were also promoted. Lt. Col. Nitai Okashi oversaw the Netzah Yehuda battalion from 2018 to 2020. In January 2019, soldiers from his unit were captured on video beating and taunting a Palestinian father and son after their arrest in the occupied West Bank. Four were later convicted of aggravated abuse. Okashi, according to Israeli media reports, asked the judge for mercy, saying the soldiers had learned their lesson. In another incident, in October 2019, 14 soldiers from his unit were arrested, according to the Israeli military, after they were caught on video assaulting Bedouin men at a gas station in the West Bank. Since leaving the battalion, Okashi has been promoted into a number of commanding roles in the IDF. He has operated in Gaza since the beginning of the war as the commander of the Jerusalem Brigade and taken reporters from international media, such as German magazine Der Spiegel and Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper on military embeds into the strip. The IDF announced a further promotion for Okashi in March. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc Lt. Col. Uri Levy was in charge of Netzah Yehuda from 2014 to 2016. During that time, a Netzah Yehuda soldier was indicted for abuse under aggravated circumstances by a military court in Israel, after he allegedly administered electric shocks to Palestinian suspects in two separate incidents in October 2015. After leaving the unit, Levy was promoted to work in the Kfir Brigade. Levy retired from the military in 2023 and now regularly appears on Israeli talk shows as a pundit. In April, when news broke that the US could be poised to sanction Netzah Yehuda, he told Israeli Channel 7: \u201cAnyone looking to find some kind of flaw in an IDF unit like this can find it, and I suggest looking at the glass half full \u2026 the operational successes, the achievements, the hard work night after night.\u201d CNN reached out to the IDF for comment on the alleged abuses carried out by Netzah Yehuda over the past decade. In response, the IDF said: \u201cIt should be noted that in relation to the events that took place in 2015 and 2019 \u2026 the involved had been indicted and the military court had imposed prison sentences in both cases, along with additional punishments.\u201d Men forced to strip naked In late 2022, Netzah Yehuda, which had been stationed in the occupied West Bank since its inception, was reassigned to the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The IDF said it was an extended operational deployment, but Blinken, in his letter to Speaker Johnson, wrote that it was an acknowledgement that the battalion had \u201cengaged in conduct inconsistent with IDF rules.\u201d Still, that track record has not stopped the IDF from deploying Netzah Yehuda soldiers to Gaza, where they have been fighting since the start of the war. On April 16, under the leadership of then-commander Lt. Col. Shlomo Shiran, Netzah Yehuda was involved in an operation at the Mahdiyya Al-Shawwa school in Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, where thousands of displaced Palestinians were sheltering, according to eyewitnesses, local journalists and IDF statements. Eyewitnesses said that the soldiers surrounded the school, \u201cfired excessively\u201d on the complex and forced men to strip naked before detaining them. The IDF said intelligence indicated Hamas fighters were in the area. A voice note allegedly recorded by Palestinians inside the school as the attack unfolded, obtained by CNN, captured panic as the civilians remained trapped inside and gunshots rang out. A video posted on social media showed a Palestinian man forced to strip naked in front of an IDF tank. The IDF did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the incident. In turning a blind eye and failing to take action against Netzah Yehuda and other units in the past, Paul said that the US has contributed to a continuing culture of impunity whose \u201ceffects we see in every outrageous TikTok video recorded and published by Israeli soldiers on the ground as they plunder, pillage, and mock their way across Gaza.\u201d That Netzah Yehuda has been allowed to fight in Gaza after having been pulled from the occupied West Bank in the wake of violent incidents is \u201cironic\u201d and concerning, the whistleblower who served in the Netzah Yehuda told CNN. In the strip, he said: \u201cThey pretty much get a carte blanche, where they can do more or less whatever they want.\u201d In the rare interview, he told CNN that he has felt compelled to speak out about the mistreatment of Palestinians by the force after reflecting on his time as a soldier. After he joined the unit at age 19, he recalled, he heard about soldiers being rewarded for killings. \u201cIf you kill a terrorist, you get two weeks off as a compensation \u2026 which is quite an attractive reward for someone that\u2019s spending a lot of time in the military,\u201d he said. The IDF said in a statement to CNN that the claim soldiers are rewarded with early leave for killing terrorists was \u201cfalse and baseless.\u201d \u201cSoldiers are going to do what their commander is expecting them to do and follow orders. And so, if these commanders don\u2019t put their foot down and punish them for their behavior, then they are in fact condoning their behavior,\u201d the whistleblower said. But, he added, \u201cMost of the commanders couldn\u2019t care less (about abuses), as long as it didn\u2019t end up on video.\u201d Credits Investigative Reporter: Katie PolglaseInvestigative Producer & Writer: Pallabi MunsiInvestigative Producer: Benjamin BrownExecutive Producer: Barbara ArvanitidisSenior Photojournalist: Alex PlattInvestigative Video Editor: Mark BaronSenior Digital Video Producer: Augusta AnthonyVisual Editor: Alberto MierPhoto Editor: Toby HancockOSINT Editor: Gianluca MezzofioreFeatures Editor: Laura Smith-SparkSenior Investigations Editor: Eliza MackintoshExecutive Editors: Dan Wright & Matt Wells Ami Kaufman and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/israel-gaza-netzah-yehuda-human-rights-abuses-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "style_dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc", "text": "Not content with Dubai having the tallest building, the deepest pool or the highest hotel, urban design firm URB hopes to add one more superlative feather to the city\u2019s cap: the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway. URB has released conceptual designs for a 64-kilometer-long highway that would see Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road, one of the city\u2019s main traffic belts, transformed into a \u201cGreen Spine,\u201d complete with autonomous, solar-powered trams and smart traffic management. Baharash Bagherian, urban planner and founder of URB, believes the \u201cfirst-of-its-kind project\u201d would make the city\u2019s design more \u201chuman-centric.\u201d \u201cDubai is rapidly expanding, with its population expected to nearly double to 8 million by 2040,\u201d Bagherian told CNN in an email. \u201cThis growth necessitates creativity and innovation to address both current and future challenges.\u201d \u201cWe must view mobility as more than just the movement of people,\u201d he added. Smart tech and solar-power The autonomous solar-powered tram is just one aspect of the proposed highway\u2019s transport system: above the tram line, a network of green areas, parks and overpasses would increase connectivity and walkability of the city, which is currently tough to navigate on foot. The highway would also integrate smart technology, such as \u201cinternet of things\u201d (IoT) sensors, to manage traffic and optimize energy use. Bagherian\u2019s designs allow for 300-megawatt solar panels and a storage system to be embedded in the tracks, that would power the tram line, as well as generate clean energy for an estimated 130,000 homes. And the green spaces \u2014 including parks and community gardens \u2014 would provide space for one million trees, which would also help cool the city and improve air quality. \u2018A unique set of challenges\u2019 Creating the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway in a desert city isn\u2019t easy, though. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) already has one of the world\u2019s highest water consumption rates per capita, consuming around 550 liters per person, per day (compared to an average of 310 liters in the US, 150 liters in Hong Kong, and 144 liters in the European Union). Most of this isn\u2019t used as drinking water, but in agriculture and landscaping, and the country\u2019s green spaces use copious amounts of water. For example, Dubai Miracle Garden \u2014 a 72,000-square-meter park displaying 150 million live flowers \u2014\u00a0consumes 757,000 liters (200,000 US gallons) of water every day. \u201cDubai presents a unique set of challenges: its rapid growth, diverse population, urban sprawl, and extreme climate conditions,\u201d Bagherian said. To combat this, Bagherian\u2019s concept includes \u201cwater-sensitive landscape design\u201d that includes native flora and drought-resistant plants suited to the arid climate, and soil mixed with zeolite, an absorbent crystal that aids water retention. These \u201cpassive techniques\u201d are complemented with smart irrigation technology, he added, \u201cwhich use real-time data to adjust watering schedules based on soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and plant needs.\u201d An urban utopia This isn\u2019t URB\u2019s first foray into utopian future city design. Its proposal for \u201cDubai Mangroves\u201d \u2014 which it claims will be \u201cworld\u2019s largest coastal regeneration project\u201d if it goes ahead \u2014 was revealed earlier this year, and last year, it also proposed a 93-kilometer indoor cycling \u201csuperhighway\u201d called The Loop that could help residents in the emirate go car-free. Like the Green Spine, none of these designs have been confirmed. But Bagherian says that turning these conceptual designs into a reality isn\u2019t as tough as it looks. \u201cWhen you break down the components of the project, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s nothing new from a technological, structural, or material standpoint,\u201d he said, adding that the innovation lies in how these technologies are \u201ccreatively and seamlessly integrated to address multiple needs.\u201d The next step involves getting public sector entities onboard, to provide \u201cthe necessary support, regulatory framework, and infrastructure integration to bring this ambitious project to life,\u201d Bagherian said. He\u2019s optimistic that this will happen, as the project aligns with the government\u2019s 2040 Urban Master Plan, and creative urban planning is key to fulfilling those goals. \u201cDubai is uniquely positioned to make this project a reality,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
