{"id": "2024_05_24_australia_daniel-duggan-us-extradition-hearing-intl-hnk", "text": "The fate of former US Marines pilot Daniel Duggan now rests with Australia\u2019s attorney general after a magistrate ruled he was eligible to be extradited to the United States to face charges related to the alleged training of Chinese military pilots. After a short hearing on Friday, Magistrate Daniel Reiss found that Duggan met the conditions for extradition and ordered him to be moved to prison while lawyers for the US wait for Attorney General Mark Dreyfus to approve his removal. Duggan has 15 days to seek a review of the order, which comes 19 months after his arrest in rural New South Wales, just weeks after returning from China to join his family in Australia. Duggan\u2019s wife Saffrine stood outside court with their six children, as she appealed to the Australian authorities to intervene. \u201cWe are absolutely heartbroken and still don\u2019t understand how this could be happening to us,\u201d she said as supporters held up\u00a0signs saying \u201cFree Dan Duggan.\u201d \u201cMy husband is a good man, a great father, a wonderful friend and husband. He faces no Australian charges and has no criminal background whatsoever. Yet he is locked up by the say-so of the United States government,\u201d she added. She described Friday\u2019s hearing as \u201csimply about ticking boxes.\u201d \u201cNow, we respectfully ask the attorney general to take another look at this case and bring my husband home.\u201d A 2017 indictment alleges Duggan trained Chinese military pilots between November 2009 and November 2012, when he was still a US citizen. Duggan met his Australian wife in 2011 and took Australian citizenship the following year. The indictment said that \u201cas early as 2008,\u201d Duggan received an email from the US State Department telling him he was required to register with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and apply for permission to train a foreign air force. Instead, it claims he conspired with others \u2013 including the Test Flying Academy of South Africa (TFASA) \u2013 to export defense services in violation of an arms embargo on China. In a statement to CNN in 2023, TFASA said it complies with the laws of every jurisdiction in which it operates. The statement said Duggan undertook one test-pilot contract for the company in South Africa between November and December 2012, and \u201cnever worked for TFASA on any of its training mandates in China.\u201d Duggan maintains the students he trained were Chinese civilians, including plane enthusiasts and people with ambitions within the civilian aviation industry. His supporters believe he\u2019s been caught up in geopolitics during a time of strained relations between the United States and China and have accused authorities of using him to send a message to former military personnel. Friday\u2019s hearing at Downing Centre Local Court was delayed for almost an hour due to protests that required the proceedings to be moved to a smaller courtroom that became so crowded that some members of the public sat on the floor. Further delays occurred after Reiss asked the floor-sitters to leave the room, warning that anyone who didn\u2019t \u201chold their tongue\u201d could be prosecuted for contempt of court. A spokesperson for the Australian attorney general said the government doesn\u2019t comment on extradition matters. Under Australia\u2019s Extradition Act, Duggan is entitled to appeal directly to the attorney general as to why he shouldn\u2019t be sent to the US. There is no set time period for the attorney general to make a decision, but by law it should be made as soon as practicable.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/australia/daniel-duggan-us-extradition-hearing-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_asia_china-military-drills-taiwan-punishment-intl-hnk", "text": "China has launched two days of large-scale military drills surrounding Taiwan\u00a0in\u00a0what it called \u201cpunishment\u201d for so-called \u201cseparatist acts,\u201d days after the self-ruling island swore in a new democratically elected leader who called on Beijing to cease its intimidation tactics. As part of the drills, dozens of Chinese fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes against \u201chigh-value military targets\u201d of the \u201cenemy\u201d alongside destroyers, frigates and missile speedboats, according to China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV. The exercises, which started early on Thursday and will encircle Taiwan, pose the first real test for newly elected Lai Ching-te as he attempts to manage relations with the island\u2019s powerful authoritarian\u00a0neighbor. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) said it launched joint military drills involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force in areas around Taiwan at 7.45 a.m. on Thursday. The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan. They are also taking place in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off China\u2019s southeastern coast, the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. PLA Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, called the exercises \u201ca strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.\u201d A senior official responsible for Taiwan\u2019s security affairs told CNN that as of noon Thursday, the island detected about 30 Chinese aircraft, most of which crossed the Median Line into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone (ADIZ).\u00a0The Median Line is an informal demarcation point in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. The Chinese military also deployed about a dozen Chinese warships around Taiwan, as well as a dozen Coast Guard vessels near Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands,\u00a0according to the official. Taiwan has deployed its own warships to monitor the situation, the official said, adding no Chinese aircraft carrier were involved in the drills so far. \u2018Irrational provocations\u2019 Taiwan\u2019s Lai is detested by Beijing as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. He succeeded two-term president Tsai Ing-wen to start an unprecedented third consecutive term in power for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Beijing has denounced Lai\u2019s inauguration speech, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry has condemned China\u2019s drills as \u201cirrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.\u201d In a statement Thursday, the ministry said it had dispatched sea, air and ground forces in response to the drills. \u201cWe stand by with firm will and restraint. We seek no conflicts, but we will not shy away from one. We have the confidence to safeguard our national security,\u201d it said. Taiwan\u2019s presidential spokeswoman Karen Kuo said in a statement: \u201cIt is regrettable to see China threatening Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations.\u201d \u201cIn the face of external challenges and threats, we will continue to defend democracy and have the confidence and ability to protect national security,\u201d Kuo added. In a statement on Thursday, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was following developments in the Taiwan Strait closely, and urged all parties to \u201crefrain from acts that could escalate tensions in the region.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people have long become used to the threat of China\u2019s war drills, and Thursday life continued as normal in the capital Taipei. While Taiwanese news outlets were reporting on the Chinese drills, it was far from the only headline on their agenda, which also included recent political bust ups in the legislature, and even information on filing taxes during the tax season. Taipei\u2019s main stock index, the TAIEX, was 0.26 percent up in mid-afternoon trade. Propaganda push China\u2019s military drills are as often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally. China\u2019s military and state media churned out propaganda and highlighted coverage of the drills, which remained a top trending topic Thursday on tightly controlled Chinese social media platforms. Footage of the drills released by the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command showed a guided missile frigate, the Nantong, and a pilot climbing into a fighter jet at a military base. The rhetoric coming from Chinese state media and the PLA portrayed the exercises as a practice run for encircling Taiwan, and even threatening small outlying islands that lie close to China\u2019s mainland. China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV said multiple destroyer and frigate formations of the Eastern Theater Command Navy \u201cmaneuvered at high speed in multiple directions in the waters surrounding Taiwan, creating an omnidirectional approach in pushing toward the island.\u201d Meanwhile, the command\u2019s air force dispatched dozens of fighter jets to Taiwan\u2019s main island and outlying islands, according to CCTV. \u201cUnder the support and cover of the Army and the Rocket Force, multiple types of aircraft were organized and loaded with live ammunition, flew to the predetermined airspace to establish multiple strike positions, and coordinated with destroyers, frigates, and missile speedboats to simulate attacking the \u2018enemy\u2019s\u2019 high-value military targets and reconnaissance and patrol aircraft,\u201d the report said. In another report, CCTV published a series of posters of what it calls \u201cthe magic weapons killing separatists\u201d promoting Taiwan independence. They include the J-20 and J-16 fighter jets, the Type 052 destroyer and Type 071 amphibious transport dock, and the Dongfeng ballistic missile. Though the report did not specify if they were being used in the ongoing drills. Carl\u00a0Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center, said Beijing was trying to stress Taiwan\u2019s older and less numerous hardware. For instance, \u201cTaiwan\u2019s F-16s are over 20 years old and every flight hour tasked to those air frames draws the fuselage and equipment ever closer to refurbishment, which takes them out of service for 1-4 months. It also stresses the force overall, keeping them on edge,\u201d he said. Schuster said in addition to the drills around Taiwan\u2019s main island, the pressing of China\u2019s Coast Guard and other forces into waters close to the outlying islands controlled by Taipei is \u201cprovocative.\u201d \u201cIt puts Taiwan on the spot. If they react militarily or forcefully, they risk triggering a conflict,\u201d he said. Rising tensions Under leader Xi Jinping, China has grown more assertive and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Taiwan as the island democracy tightens informal ties with the United States. Officials in Washington have been anticipating for several months the prospect of Chinese\u00a0provocations around the inauguration and had been having contingency conversations as part of their planning, according to officials. Periods of higher tension, like the swearing-in of a new president in Taiwan, are areas where US officials frequently brace for a Chinese show of force, officials say. \u201cThere\u2019s no surprise whenever there\u2019s an action that highlights Taiwan in the international sphere the Chinese feel compelled to make some kind of form of statement,\u201d Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Stephen Sklenka, the deputy commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command told the National Press Club of Australia on Thursday. In August 2022, China staged massive war games around Taiwan to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. Beijing fired missiles into waters surrounding the island and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships, in its largest show of force in years. A similar encirclement exercise was also held in April 2023. Chinese warplanes now regularly fly into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and across the Median Line in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 an informal demarcation point that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. Beijing has also exerted pressure on Lai in the lead-up to his inauguration. On May 15, days before Lai took office, Taipei said it detected 45 Chinese military aircraft around Taiwan, the highest single-day number this year. Evan A. Feigenbaum,\u00a0vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, calls China\u2019s latest drills \u201can intimidation tactic, part of a pattern, not a sign of imminent war.\u201d \u201cBeijing has a robust coercion kitbag from which it will mix and match, ratchet up and back and up again to signal its range of options to coerce and inflict pain,\u201d he wrote on social platform X. Some defense experts noted that the name of China\u2019s latest military exercises \u201cJoint Sword-2024A\u201d suggests another round of drills could follow later this year. Drew Thompson, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, noted the drills were part of a pattern. \u201cIt is not a surprise, nor is it a tactical response to President Lai\u2019s speech. These exercises are part of the PLA\u2019s long-term, strategic preparations to fight and win a war over Taiwan,\u201d he told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/asia/china-military-drills-taiwan-punishment-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 1989 \u201cStudy for Portrait of Jos\u00e9 Capelo\u201d is the fourth painting to be recovered of the group, which is estimated to be worth a combined \u20ac25 million. In February, police arrested two people accused of the receipt of stolen artworks in the Spanish capital, leading them to ultimately discover the painting at a property in Madrid. Since the investigation began, 16 people believed to have masterminded and carried out the robbery have been arrested, police said in a statement. Three of the paintings were\u00a0recovered in 2017. Police said they continue to investigate Spanish citizens with links to organized groups from Eastern Europe in the hope it will lead them to the fifth painting. According to local media, the paintings were stolen from the apartment of Jos\u00e9 Capelo, Bacon\u2019s friend and former lover, although police would not confirm or deny that information. Dublin-born Bacon, who died in Madrid in 1992, was one of the most acclaimed artists of the 20th century, known for his disturbing vision of the human body.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-american-sentencing", "text": "The first of several Americans recently charged with possession of ammunition in Turks and Caicos headed home Friday after getting a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. But four other Americans still await their fate. In recent months, all were arrested and accused of bringing in various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the local governor said. Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania had pleaded guilty to the charge, the Turks and Caicos government said. On Friday, he got a 52-week sentence that was suspended for one year, meaning he would not face immediate incarceration, Hagerich\u2019s attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel, told CNN. Hagerich was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory and return to the United States once he paid the fine, Smith said. He would have to serve the full 12-month sentence if the fine was not paid. Hagerich flew back to the US Friday afternoon, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign. The organization helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. \u201cVery grateful to the Court for giving two very special kids their dad back. Even more grateful to the numerous (Turks and Caicos Islands) nationals who helped along the way,\u201d Franks posted to X along with a picture of Hagerich boarding a plane. After Hagerich arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport on Friday night, he told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Smith said his client was \u201cpleased, he\u2019s relieved\u201d by the outcome. \u201cThe sentence, in all its circumstances, is reasonable and fair,\u201d Smith said. After Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said justice \u201chas been served as the law intended.\u201d \u201cAs we have said, The Firearms Act includes consideration for exceptional circumstances,\u201d Misick said, \u201cand today\u2019s decision reflects our commitment to judicial independence along with upholding the law. Residents and visitors can be confident that the Turks and Caicos Islands are dedicated to safety and compassion as we protect the safety and rights of all.\u201d The four other Americans charged have been released on bail while they await their court dates, Misick\u2019s office said in a statement. One was allowed to return to the US for medical reasons, and the rest are staying in Turks and Caicos. US lawmakers tried to get Americans freed A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands this week and asked for charges to be dropped for the five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. Hagerich\u2019s sentencing came after the US officials expressed disappointment over their attempted intervention. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward,\u201d Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said in a statement this week. In addition to Hagerich, two other Americans \u2013 Michael Lee Evans and Tyler Wenrich \u2013 have pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, Smith said. A fourth American, Ryan Tyler Watson, will have a hearing Tuesday to determine if he will enter a plea or go to trial, Smith said. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications in the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. Watson\u2019s wife, who will appear\u00a0in\u00a0Turks\u00a0and\u00a0Caicos\u00a0court\u00a0next\u00a0week\u00a0for her husband\u2019s ammunition offenses, told CNN her husband\u00a0plans\u00a0to\u00a0employ a similar legal strategy\u00a0as Hagerich. \u201cI think we\u2019re\u00a0planning\u00a0to\u00a0kind of follow the\u00a0same path\u00a0that Bryan did,\u201d Valerie Watson told CNN on Saturday. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got a plan that they\u2019ve already come up with.\u201d Hagerich and Watson share the same attorney, Valerie Watson said. \u201cI think he\u2019s ready\u00a0to\u00a0just go\u00a0in\u00a0(to\u00a0court) on Tuesday so they can get that going,\u201d she added. Turks and Caicos: No special treatment should be given to any group Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said the mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. And US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date. Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. By contrast, the United States has more guns than people. Now, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d While the US and Turks and Caicos collaborate in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d But at least one appointed member of the opposition, Alvin Garland, expressed concern about the American citizens\u2019 arrests. Garland said the islands\u2019 governor is correct in not interfering with the ongoing court cases in order to adhere to the government\u2019s separation of powers, but added he believes most, if not all, of the cases involving American tourists will fall into the \u201cexceptional circumstances category\u201d and sentences could be shorter than the mandatory 12-year minimum.

In a speech celebrating US-Mexico cooperation on the case, US President Joe Biden on Saturday hailed the extradition of El Nini \u2013 also known as N\u00e9stor Isidro P\u00e9rez Salas \u2013 as \u201ca good day for justice.\u201d \u201cEl Nini played a prominent role in the notorious Sinaloa cartel, one of the deadliest drug trafficking enterprises in the world. The United States has charged him for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and for murdering, torturing, and kidnapping numerous rivals, witnesses, and others,\u201d Biden said, thanking Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. \u201cOur governments will continue to work together to attack the fentanyl and synthetic drug epidemic that is killing so many people in our homelands and globally, and to bring to justice the criminals and organizations producing, smuggling, and selling these lethal poisons in both of our countries,\u201d he added. According to the US Department of Justice, N\u00e9stor Isidro P\u00e9rez Salas \u201cwas one of the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s lead sicarios, or assassins\u201d and was involved in the \u201cproduction and sale of fentanyl\u201d in the United States. Biden has previously described El Nini as one of America\u2019s most-wanted criminals. P\u00e9rez Salas was charged in the US with cocaine and methamphetamine trafficking conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and witness retaliation\u00a0in February 2021. The\u00a0US State Department\u00a0offered a reward of up to $3 million for information leading to his arrest and he was detained in Mexico\u00a0in November of last year. According to the State Department,\u00a0P\u00e9rez Salas worked directly with Oscar No\u00e9 Medina Gonz\u00e1lez, a subordinate of Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar, one of the sons of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who was\u00a0sentenced to prison\u00a0in the US in 2019. The State Department also said\u00a0P\u00e9rez Salas was responsible for the security apparatus of Los Chapitos, a faction of the Sinaloa\u00a0cartel. He is accused of being one of the commanders of the \u201cNinis\u201d cell, described as a \u201cparticularly violent\u201d group of security personnel for Los Chapitos. \u201cI am grateful to our Mexican government counterparts for their extraordinary efforts in apprehending and extraditing El Nini,\u201d US Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cThe Justice Department will continue to go after the cartels responsible for flooding our communities with fentanyl and other drugs.\u201d CNN\u2019s Evan Perez and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/americas/el-nini-mexican-cartel-extradited-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, 72, is accused of leading the plot, which would have led to him becoming Germany\u2019s head of state. The prince appeared at a specially erected high-security courtroom in Frankfurt alongside eight other defendants, including former judge Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, who was allegedly ready to become minister of justice. In total, nine ringleaders accused of treason are believed to have planned the resurrection of the German Reich, or empire, through violence, by storming the Bundestag, the national parliament, and kidnapping President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Tuesday marks the opening of the second of the three trials across Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Munich, forming one of the biggest anti-terror cases in modern German history. With 27 defendants in total, the case was split into three trials for logistical reasons. In addition to the five judges, two others will be on standby for the Frankfurt trial in the event of a long-term absence. Around 260 witnesses will be summoned and up to 45 officers will ensure security on site. Malsack-Winkemann, an ex-lawmaker for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, allegedly led several co-defendants around the Reichstag building scouting the location. The defendants also include former army officers Maximilian Eder and Ruediger von Pescatore, who allegedly shared \u201ca deep aversion to German state institutions and to the democratic basic order,\u201d the Hesse higher regional court said in a statement. The plot by the terror organization to overthrow the German government and install martial law was uncovered in 2022. The group had planned to replace the government with a cabinet-like council and a military wing since August 2021, according to the charges. The plotters amassed almost $550,000 in funds and had access to a massive armory, according to the Public Prosecutor.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/germany-far-right-plot-heinrich-xiii-prince-reuss-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_europe_ukraine-draft-law-conscription-intl", "text": "The air at the Ukrainian military recruitment office where a 30-year-old hairdresser is being interviewed is filled with anxiety. The man has no military experience and is unsure whether any of his skills would be useful. At one point, the recruiter jokingly suggests that he might be able to give everyone a nice haircut. But the man \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous given his pending military status\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is there anyway. \u201cThe time has come,\u201d he told CNN. Under Ukraine\u2019s new mobilization law, which came into effect on May 18, Ukrainian men are now facing a choice: Comply and face the possibility of being sent to the frontlines, or try to evade and risk penalties and condemnation. The hairdresser has chosen to pre-empt the choice and volunteered, becoming one of six men to be interviewed at the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion\u2019s recruitment center in Kyiv that day. The office is housed in an ordinary residential building, hidden from the outside world. Inside though, the walls are decorated with photos and big banners showing the logo of the battalion, a drawing of three teeth-baring wolves inside a stylized Ukrainian trident. The unit\u2019s recruitment slogan is \u201cEveryone will fight\u201d and the recruiter\u2019s laptop is covered in stickers, one of them saying \u201cYour pack is waiting for you.\u201d Ukraine has made no secret of the urgent need to recruit more people as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression. While the government doesn\u2019t reveal the number of dead and wounded, estimates made by experts speak of hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides of the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. One Ukrainian commander who asked not to be named for security reasons said the personnel shortages are having devastating effects on the battlefield. \u201cIf there had been 1,000 to 1,500 more servicemen in Avdiivka, we would have protected the weak spots through which the enemy entered. \u2026 If we had more people, we would have held out much longer,\u201d he told CNN of the eastern industrial city, which fell to Russian forces in February after Ukraine held it for more than a decade. Making the case for a new mobilization, Yurii Sodol, the commander of the Joint Forces of Ukraine\u2019s military, told Ukrainian lawmakers last month that Russian troops outnumbered Ukrainian \u201cseven to 10 times\u201d in eastern Ukraine. This lack of personnel is putting immense pressure on those who are already serving. \u201cThe war is still going on and mobilization is essential. People who have been fighting for two years are tired. Some are going crazy,\u201d said Yaroslav Galas, who is currently serving with the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade. \u201cSoldiers need proper rest for several months. They need to heal, relax and forget. They need to spend the money they have earned with sweat and blood, to solve their economic and personal issues,\u201d he told CNN. To make the recruitment process more efficient and more transparent, the new law requires all Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 to register with the military and always have their documents on them. However, only men aged 25 to 60 are subject to mobilization under the new law. The lower limit has been slashed by two years from 27 years, but it\u2019s unlikely to make much difference because of Ukraine\u2019s demographic challenges. High emigration and low birth rates in the 1990s and 2000s mean there are far fewer\u00a0people currently in their 20s, compared to those in their 30s and 40s. Women who have medical or pharmaceutical qualifications must also register with the military, although they are not required to serve. The new rules have been controversial \u2013 the draft law was amended more than 4,000 times during the approval process. \u2018Desire to fight\u2019 It is unclear how many people will end up being called up. Late last year, the leader of President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s Servant of the People faction in parliament said the military was looking for an extra 500,000 servicemen and women. But the Commander-in-Chief of Ukrainian Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi said recently that any increase in numbers would likely be significantly lower. Some military officers are already questioning whether it will work. Their main worry is that they\u2019ll end up with units full of men who are only there because someone forced them to be. \u201cWe still want people to join voluntarily. Because there is a big difference between someone who was drafted into the army and someone who went to defend their homeland,\u201d said Dmytro Kulibaba, a soldier with the 114th Territorial Defense Brigade. \u201cThe desire to fight the enemy is very important, in addition to training, equipment and preparedness,\u201d he told CNN. Galas said that many people are worried that if they get drafted, they will be automatically sent to the frontlines \u2013 which he said is not the case. \u201cIf you are a specialist, for example, who in civilian life was engaged in IT, accounting, project management, even cooks, clerks, then the Armed Forces also need you \u2026 and you can also make a fairly large contribution to the common victory by joining the Armed Forces,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe have a separate drone unit who are a little further away from the frontline. People who are good at electronics, even those who like to play computer games, will quickly master this specialty.\u201d \u2018Sense of camaraderie\u2019 One Kyiv-based business owner told CNN he had been researching his options long before receiving the draft notice in the mail. He knew it was coming, he said, he just didn\u2019t know when. \u201cI had been preparing for this for about a year or six months. I talked to my friends who are serving, I asked them about everything,\u201d the 35-year-old said, explaining that his goal was to find a unit that would be a good fit for him. The man is currently in a training center and will be joining the army in couple of months, which is why he cannot be named by CNN. \u00a0He is currently considering two options \u00a0\u2013\u00a0reconnaissance or anti-aircraft missile troops. He said agreeing to serve was a clear choice for him \u2013 despite some of his loved ones trying to steer him away from it. \u201cYou think about all the options when you must make such a decision. How can I look my son in the eye when I say that I was somewhere (else)? I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t work for me. I made a moral and ethical decision for myself. And then I had to decide with whom I would (feel most comfortable) serving with,\u201d he said. Galas told CNN he believes the mobilization campaign has not been going well because it does not give people enough information. \u201cIt scares people away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what is happening in the combat brigades and it needs to be explained to them.\u201d He said that despite the initial worry, many soldiers adapt well to their new life, giving an example of a young IT specialist who was mobilized within the past few months. \u201cOnce he joined this team, he saw that life in an infantry unit is not what civilians imagine. Yes, it is dangerous and difficult. But good people are there, and the bad ones don\u2019t stay. There is a sense of camaraderie. And this is important,\u201d he explained. The IT man had impressed his commanders immediately, he added. \u201cHe did very well during his first combat mission in Robotyno, holding positions 400 meters away from the Russians. He not only withstood assaults but also took prisoners,\u201d he said. But not everyone is able to adjust to the realities of life on the frontline. The commanding officer who asked to remain anonymous spoke of another problem with the mobilization, saying that in recent times some recruits have not received the training they need to withstand the pressure. \u201cThe infantry being sent to the frontline needs to be given special training to make them real professionals. Because they come in here, drop their weapons, and run away from their positions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be motivation for the current military and those about to serve. We cannot use the methods used in Russia or Belarus \u2013 catching and imposing \u2013 this will not help. It will only lead to people running away and giving up their positions,\u201d he added. Running away But the military clearly isn\u2019t for everyone.\u00a0CNN spoke to one man who is determined to avoid serving no matter what.\u00a0He asked to remain anonymous because he is afraid of retribution. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill people, and in principle, I\u2019m not ready for that.\u00a0If shelling starts on the frontline, I think I will be confused and will only create problems for others,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI think I\u2019d be more useful making money and bringing dollars to the country than digging trenches or guarding military facilities,\u201d he added. He said he believes Ukraine doesn\u2019t have enough weapons to militarily reclaim territory seized by Russia in the war. The only way forward, he said, is a political agreement that would lead to Ukraine regaining its land. The man said that if he was to receive a draft notice, he would leave the country. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave; I know that things are not so beautiful and sunny in Europe. But if I had to choose between going to war or going abroad, I would choose abroad, I would pay a bribe. My life comes first. And I realize that there is a very high chance of being killed,\u201d he said. The soldiers who are currently serving have little patience for men like this one, who say they can\u2019t join the fight. \u201cSoldiers who go on leave or for treatment, who are exhausted \u2026\u00a0of course that (seeing other men) drinking coffee in coffee shops, going to restaurants, pumping their biceps and (saying they were) \u2018not born for war\u2019 make soldiers angry,\u201d Galas said. Unless they obtain a special permit, men between the ages of 18 and 60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion and last month, the government suspended consular services for men who are not registered with the military. Still, many attempt to run away anyway. Andrii Demchenko, the spokesperson for the Border Guard Service of Ukraine, told CNN his officers detain people trying to cross out of Ukraine on daily basis. Some are willing to risk everything trying to escape. The Border Service said that since the start of the full-scale invasion, the bodies of 32 men have been found in the Tysa River on the border with Romania and Hungary.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/ukraine-draft-law-conscription-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-interview-icc-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied allegations that he was starving Palestinians in Gaza as a method of war in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday, saying an arrest warrant application currently under review in the International Criminal Court (ICC) is based on a \u201cpack of lies.\u201d ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced Monday that he had requested arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders and two Israeli politicians \u2013 Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant \u2013 on allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Khan said the accusations against Netanyahu and Gallant include \u201ccausing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.\u201d Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu called Khan a \u201crogue prosecutor that has put false charges and created false symmetries that are both dangerous and false\u201d and insisted that Israel has been allowing food and medical aid to enter Gaza, where aid groups say that the blockaded Palestinian enclave is currently at risk of famine. Israel has allowed 20,000 trucks of aid into Gaza, Netanyahu said \u2013 a fraction of what would have entered in the same period under normal times. Israel\u2019s ongoing siege of Gaza, following Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attacks, has reached its seventh month and left more than 34,000 people dead. Serious questions about the Israeli military\u2019s long-term strategy have been raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza, an area it had previously declared clear of Hamas. Last week, Israel\u2019s defense chief Gallant\u00a0called on Netanyahu\u00a0to publicly rule out Israeli governance over the Gaza Strip and to lay out his\u00a0post-war plans for civilian rule in Gaza, warning that he opposes Israeli rule in the Palestinian enclave. When Netanyahu was asked by Tapper if he would rule out the Israeli occupation of Gaza, the Israeli politician said that \u201cresettling\u201d the Palestinian territory was out of the question. \u201cYou mean resettling Gaza? Yeah. It was never in the cards, and I said so openly [and] some of my constituents are not happy about it, but that\u2019s my position.\u201d The prime minister also reaffirmed his commitment to eradicating Hamas, which governs Gaza, before considering demilitarizing the Strip, in the interview. With more than 100 hostages still believed to be held in Gaza, pressure has been growing for a deal that would see hostages released in exchange for a ceasefire. But when asked about public polling showing that a majority of Israelis believe freeing hostages is a higher priority than military action, Netanyahu said you could not have one without the other. \u201cMilitary action that we take against Hamas is in fact the way to get these hostages because without military pressure, basically, without, you know, squeezing them, Hamas is not going to give up anything,\u201d he told Tapper. Netanyahu is deeply unpopular in Israel, where he is also facing an ongoing corruption trial. Critics have accused the Prime Minister of being beholden to members of his far-right coalition and prolonging the war to maintain his grip on power. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu rejected accusations that he avoids Israeli media in favor of international press, saying he has done up to 20 press conferences with Israeli journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak to them and I speak to you and I welcome the opportunity to tell the truth and dispel the lies in both in both mediums.\u201d \u2018No equivalence\u2019 The ICC\u2019s application for warrants over the war in Gaza marked the first time the international court has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, but the court\u00a0has said that it\u00a0has\u00a0jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. An ICC warrant would compel more than 100 member-nations of the court to arrest Netanyahu if he traveled in their territory. France was among the countries that have supported the ICC decision alongside international rights groups. Human rights organization Amnesty International has\u00a0hailed the arrest warrant request as a\u00a0\u201ccrucial step towards justice.\u201d But Israel\u2019s allies have roundly condemned\u00a0Khan\u2019s\u00a0move, with US President Joe Biden calling it \u201coutrageous.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThere is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas,\u201d\u00a0Biden said.\u00a0\u00a0Several US lawmakers have threatened to levy sanctions against the ICC, and\u00a0Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0has said\u00a0he is open to legislative action against the court. The\u00a0Biden administration said earlier this month\u00a0that\u00a0it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law \u2013 but\u00a0stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu likened himself to President Franklin Roosevelt, claiming the arrest warrants were like putting Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on the docks alongside the American wartime president who oversaw the US\u2019s mobilization\u00a0during World War\u00a0II. Khan previously told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that he had received international pressure over his investigation of Israel. \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\u201d Khan described one senior leader telling him.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release.

As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

In the videos, horse-mounted police and water cannons can be seen in Tel Aviv\u2019s Democracy Square attempting to disperse crowds refusing to leave, resulting in violent clashes. At a separate protest, police said they arrested two people \u201cfor disorderly conduct\u201d after they allegedly left the approved demonstration site at the Kaplan intersection, headed to the Azrieli intersection and \u201clit fires and began to break the order, not obeying the police\u2019s instructions.\u201d \u201cA police officer declared the demonstration illegal and warned that if they did not disperse the police would be forced to use measures,\u201d police added in a statement. The clashes followed anti-government protest marches that took place in several cities across Israel, calling for the release of hostages taken during Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, and for a general election. Around 250 people\u00a0were taken hostage during\u00a0Hamas\u2019 surprise October 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. Since then, Israel\u2019s retaliatory war on Hamas in Gaza has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. Many of the protesters in the streets of Tel Aviv, Haifa, Rehovot and beyond on Saturday took aim at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing his government of corruption and criticizing his handling of the war against Hamas. Families of current and past hostages also held a rally calling for an immediate resumption of negotiations with Hamas to \u201cadvance a deal that will bring them all back.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) believes 125 hostages are still being held in Gaza, following the release deal in November that freed more than 100. Of those still in Gaza, 121 were kidnapped on Oct 7; the four others were already being held before the attacks. The PMO believes that at least 37 of the hostages still in the Gaza Strip are dead.

A further 11 people remain missing, all employees at the shopping center, according to authorities. Officials have said there were nearly 200 people inside the building when the strike occurred. \u201cThe air raid siren went off and some people managed to get out of the building, roughly 100 people. However there were still people inside the building,\u201d Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, said Saturday in an interview on national television. \u201cSpecialized services are responding to the scene. All injured are being provided with assistance,\u201d Syniehubov earlier said. \u201cThere is not a single military object nearby,\u201d he added. Two of the people who died were employees of the hypermarket, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Oleksandr Filchakov, said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the strike a \u201cbrutal attack\u201d in a post on X. Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that \u201csignificant amounts of flammable materials\u201d inside the hypermarket are making firefighting \u201ccomplicated,\u201d adding that there is also a possibility of the fire spreading further to nearby warehouses. \u201cAt the same time, there is a constant threat of repeated enemy shelling,\u201d Klymenko said. The attack comes as Russian forces continue to advance in the Kharkiv region after crossing the northern border earlier this month and opening a new front in the conflict. Seven people were killed in Russian strikes on the city Thursday, after locations including a printing house were targeted. After Saturday\u2019s attack, Zelensky reiterated that \u201cif Ukraine had enough air defense systems and modern combat aircraft, such Russian strikes would have been impossible.\u201d \u201cThat is why we are appealing to all leaders, to all states: we need a significant strengthening of air defense,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a task that must be accomplished and can only be done together with the world. Every day we call on the world: give us air defense, save people. Every single withheld decision on support means the loss of our people,\u201d Zelensky added. Meanwhile, at least two people were killed and at least 10 injured as a result of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian village in the Belgorod region, the region\u2019s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Saturday. Among the injured is an 8-year-old boy, he said, adding, \u201call victims had shrapnel wounds in various parts of the body.\u201d As a result of the strike, a private residential building caught fire, and about 20 other buildings and 23 cars sustained damage. \u201cAll operational services are working on site,\u201d Gladkov said.

Two residents, Dean Wiggins, 78,\u00a0and\u00a0Pamela Wiggins, 77, were killed\u00a0when their home was struck by a\u00a0tornado, according to the Adair and Guthrie County Emergency Management Agency. Another\u00a0man, Michael Jensen, 73, died at his residence. And William Williamson, 70, succumbed to his\u00a0injuries after being\u00a0transported from his home to a hospital. In addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, officials said earlier. Monica Irma Zamarron, 49, lost her life after being ejected from her vehicle on Highway 148, according to\u00a0officials. The Iowa State Patrol said the number of those injured from the Greenfield twister \u201cis likely higher, but these numbers reflect only those patients treated for their injuries at designated alternate care sites.\u201d At least 14 patients were taken to medical facilities outside of the county, the release added. The\u00a0tornado that carved through Greenfield \u2013 about 50 miles southwest of Des Moines \u2013\u00a0was\u00a0an EF4,\u00a0the National Weather Service in Des Moines said Thursday, and\u00a0is\u00a0the deadliest of the year. The tornado had peak winds of\u00a0175 mph to\u00a0185 mph,\u00a0was\u00a0more than a half-mile\u00a0wide\u00a0and was on the ground for 44 miles,\u00a0according to the National Weather Service in Des Moines. More than 100 first responders were combing through the wreckage of the town Wednesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said. The city\u2019s hospital sustained damage and some patients were moved to other facilities in surrounding areas. At least four medical airlift flights occurred. A \u201cmakeshift hospital\u201d was set up in the city\u2019s lumberyard Tuesday right after the tornado tracked out of the area, State Rep. Ray Sorensen said Wednesday. Sorensen lives in the area and assisted with recovery efforts in the immediate aftermath. \u201cWe pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher that we made for him on the back of a truck,\u201d Sorensen recalled. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures were obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d Reynolds said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe until you can actually see the devastation.\u201d At least three tornadoes were reported in Iowa on Tuesday \u2013 part of a torrent of storms that left widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding across the US this week. Tornado reports have skyrocketed well-above average in recent weeks as the typically busiest period of severe weather season unfolds. The more than 800 tornadoes reported so far make 2024 one of the most active years for twisters on record. Greenfield, home to just over 2,100 residents, must now recover from the damage of the deadliest tornado in a year that\u2019s recorded fewer deaths from twisters than 2023. Despite the number of tornadoes this year, there had been 17 deaths from the beginning of 2024 until Tuesday, while 65 people died due to tornadoes during the same period last year. Nearly 15,000 homes and businesses were in the dark across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. On Wednesday, a tornado hurtled through Temple, Texas \u2013 about 35 miles south of Waco \u2013 causing widespread power outages and making many roads dangerous or impassable. First responders were flooded with emergency requests and were prioritizing life-saving calls Wednesday night, the city said in a release announcing a disaster declaration. \u201cCurrently, no life-threatening injuries or fatalities have been reported,\u201d the release said. More than 125,000 homes and businesses in Texas were without power Thursday morning, including nearly 55,000 in Bell County, where Temple is located, according to PowerOutage.us. More than 200 homes destroyed in Iowa The governor expanded her disaster declaration from 15 counties to 32 on Thursday, and said state officials are working with the FEMA to get the federal declaration approved, citing \u201ca lot of destruction and damage across the state.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to process it as quickly as we can,\u201d said FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. More than 200 homes were destroyed in Iowa, Reynolds said. Greenfield and other parts of western Iowa bore the brunt of the storms\u2019 catastrophic impacts: In Greenfield\u2019s county, Adair, 153 homes were either damaged or destroyed, according to Reynolds. A tornado also toppled a hulking wind turbine just south of Greenfield in Prescott, Iowa, and more than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \u201ccritical public facilities,\u201d emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing. But Greenfield is the epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s event. \u201cThere is basically nothing left,\u201d Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told KCCI. \u201cI was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\u201d she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \u201cI heard it, and I knew it was hitting.\u201d Warrior said the scale of damage is devastating to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis. \u201cThey\u2019ll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that\u2019s what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\u201d Fighting back tears, Warrior looked out the rubble strewn across her neighborhood and tried to crack a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart, Amy Simonson, Andy Rose, Brad Parks and Raja Razek contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/weather/iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_summer-2024-air-travel-hurdles", "text": "If you\u2019re expecting to take to the skies this summer, you should also expect lots and lots and lots of companionship. And a few hurdles, too. Memorial Day weekend, the traditional launching pad of the summer travel season, is shaping up to set a scorching pace. The Federal Aviation Administration has forecast the holiday to be its busiest in 14 years. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 18 million passengers and crew between Thursday and Wednesday \u2013 up more than 6% over last year.\u00a0TSA says it\u2019s prepared for its busiest summer ever. American Airlines and United Airlines are both expecting about 10% more passengers over the holiday weekend than last year. United is expecting the biggest Memorial Day and summer travel season in the airline\u2019s 98-year history, according to Andrew Nocella, United\u2019s executive vice president and chief commercial officer. When it comes to navigating the flocks of fellow flyers, don\u2019t look for much of an ease-up after Memorial Day weekend. US airlines are predicted to carry 271 million passengers around the world from June 1 to August 31, according to industry trade organization Airlines for America. That\u2019s a 6.3% increase from last summer, and a new record for US airlines. To meet the higher demand, Airlines for America said that US carriers will offer more than 26,000 scheduled flights a day \u2013 up nearly 1,400 a day from summer 2023. While US airlines have staffed up and the TSA says it\u2019s ready for the summer crush, an air traffic controller crunch, hot weather and crowded airports could bring flight disruptions and pain points. Air traffic controller shortage Despite a surge in hiring last year, air\u202ftraffic\u202fcontrol stations nationwide are still about 3,000 controllers short, according to new FAA numbers. The numbers show the challenge of filling the gap that led to flight delays and concerns that fatigue contributed to a series of near collisions on runways last year. The current understaffing means controllers at many facilities are regularly working overtime to cover gaps. The shortage is a concern of\u202fairlines, controllers and watchdogs alike. Scott Keyes, founder of travel site\u00a0Going,\u00a0said that because of the way air traffic control maps are divvied up, airports in New York City metro area and in Florida have a slightly higher chance of being affected by air traffic control issues. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t, you know, not take that trip to New York or to Miami because of air traffic control,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN Travel. People flying in and out of those markets should try to get early morning flights and nonstop flights to help minimize problems if they come up. \u201cI was flying to New York a couple days ago and my flight to New York got delayed by four hours,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cIt was a pain in the butt \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong. But that just meant I arrived in New York four hours later. \u201cIf I had had a connection in Chicago and my flight was delayed by four hours, I would have missed that connection. And then it\u2019s a much more hairy situation.\u201d Hot weather and hurricanes Much of the United States is looking at varying probabilities of having higher temperatures than the average for summer \u2013 especially in the Northeast and desert Southwest. Extreme heat can do more than make you feel miserable. It also affects airlines\u2019 abilities to carry out normal schedules, according to a report from Embry\u2011Riddle Aeronautical University. \u201cHot air is thin air. While this reduces the lift on which planes rely for takeoff, the main impact is felt on engine thrust. Aircraft engines will produce less thrust during takeoff and ascent as a result,\u201d said Bob Thomas, assistant professor of aeronautical science.\u00a0\u201cThe only way to make a takeoff possible on shorter runways would be to lower the weight of the aircraft.\u201d He said airlines generally reduce weight by removing baggage or passengers, especially as temperatures reach the triple digits. Cancellations are even possible. The report suggested trying to book early morning and late evening flights when you expect to fly in hot weather zones. Experts also warn that as the effects of climate change increase, passengers can expect longer periods of turbulence during flights in coming years. Says one professor of atmospheric science: \u201cThe seat belt sign will be switched on a lot more.\u201d And if you haven\u2019t heard, meteorologists warn we\u2019re phasing out of an El Ni\u00f1o cycle in the equatorial Pacific (with warmer waters) and phasing into a La Ni\u00f1a period (with cooler waters). And La Ni\u00f1a can sometimes generate increased hurricane activity along the US Gulf and Atlantic coasts. In fact, forecasters predict a \u201chyperactive Atlantic hurricane season\u201d with eight to 13 hurricanes. They think four to seven of them could reach at least a strength of Category 3, which have sustained winds of 111 to 129 mph. (The hurricane scale goes up to Category 5, which has sustained winds of 157 mph or more.) Bottom line, especially as summer progresses into peak hurricane season: Keep your eye on the forecasts if you\u2019re scheduled to fly. Crowded airports Passengers will need to pay attention to their ground game this summer, said Keyes. \u201cHere\u2019s how I put it: Airports are going to be extremely full. Airplanes are only gonna be pretty full.\u201d Keyes said new plane deliveries and additional flights will ease the load factor. \u201cThere\u2019s about 10 to 15 percent more capacity this year than there was a year ago. And \u2026 more seats mean there\u2019s going to be more elbow room for folks this summer even during the busy travel season.\u201d That won\u2019t help in the crowded airports, though. He has a couple of tips to mitigate that. First, get TSA PreCheck and/or Fast Track so you can at least bypass possible security line bottlenecks. Secondly, Keyes says he likes to find a quieter, more restful pocket of the airport away from his gate in which to hang out before his flight. He downloads the airline\u2019s mobile app, which notifies him just before boarding is about to start. Silver lining for flyers For those flyers who must carefully consider every dollar they spend, they could find the summer of 2024 to be a less expensive one than last year. Travel site Kayak reports that summer fares should be lower. For US domestic flyers, fares should drop an average of 13% compared with 2023. Mexico is seeing an even bigger drop with fares averaging 16% less. And if Australia is a dream trip of yours, those fares are falling an average of 14% (though the average price is $1,509, Kayak says). For people scared off from Europe last summer by the crowds and high prices, Keyes had some good news. \u201cI think a lot of that pent-up demand [from the pandemic] has been exhausted. I think you\u2019re going to see higher supply, lower demand and cheaper fares to Europe this summer as a result.\u201d Kayak is showing a 7% dip in Europe fares compared with last summer. While hardly typical, Keyes said he\u2019s recently spotted some round-trip mega-bargains that were almost nonexistent last summer: Paris for $570, Iceland for $475 and Dublin for $457.

In a post on X, Duckworth said she was \u201cbeyond relieved that Dr. Hamawy \u2013 and his entire team \u2013 safely left Gaza today and that he will be able to see his family again soon.\u201d Hamawy previously turned down an evacuation offer, refusing to leave his non-US colleagues behind, who\u00a0weren\u2019t afforded the option to leave earlier. \u201cIt was only US citizens who could leave.

It was that simple,\u201d Hamawy told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic doctor concept for me as a US former service member that you don\u2019t leave your teammates behind. On leaving Gaza, Hamawy told CNN,\u00a0\u201cWe are glad that we are out and that we all left together. Our hearts are with the people who still have to endure and cannot leave.\u201d \u201cWe hope that medical relief is allowed to replace us soon and a permanent ceasefire puts an end to this nightmare.\u201d The evacuation was a multi-lateral effort involving Jordan and the US. Australian, Egyptian, Irish and Omani nationals were among the evacuees.\u00a0The team were told to follow a specific route to the\u00a0Kerem Shalom crossing and were taken by the Jordanian military to the King Hussein Bridge.

You have the power to end the invasion of Rafah and Gaza now.\u201d The group were working with the Palestine American Medical Association under the umbrella of the World Health Organization at the European Hospital in northern Rafah. While the hospital wasn\u2019t ordered to evacuate, Hamawy was \u201coften awakened by a strike that [shook] the whole hospital.\u201d In his letter to Biden he added, \u201cWe are hearing bombs drop around us more frequently, amidst thousands of sheltering civilians. The streams of patients, mostly children, are rising faster than we can keep up with fewer medical staff.\u201d More than 35,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s seven-month military offensive, most of them women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. According to Hamawy, the European Hospital is \u201cthe last standing hospital that\u2019s functionating like a functional medical center.\u201d Many hospitals have been forced to evacuate and, \u201cthe ones before them have all been raided and destroyed.\u201d No medical team replaced the healthcare professionals who evacuated Tuesday, leaving the hospital with even fewer workers to look after patients with increasingly fewer resources.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/middleeast/european-hospital-gaza-medics-freed-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

One person was killed and 104 were injured on board a Singapore Airlines plane Tuesday after the aircraft rapidly plunged before ascending several hundred feet, then repeated the drop and climb.

Never before has the Jewish state come under such intense and sustained international pressure from multiple fronts for its policies towards the Palestinians. This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the ranks of world leaders branded as international pariahs when he became the target of the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against him and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant for suspicion of war crimes and crimes against humanity during Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The court has previously sought warrants against the likes of Sudan\u2019s Omar Al Bashir, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Libya\u2019s Moammar Gadhafi. And on Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying the humanitarian situation there is \u201cdisastrous\u201d and expected to \u201cintensify further.\u201d Seven months after Hamas attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, Israel\u2019s retaliatory war has failed to achieve its goals. Top Hamas leaders remain at large and 125 hostages remain captive in the enclave. Gaza is now in ruins and more than 35,000 Palestinians have died during Israel\u2019s onslaught. Pressure on Israel to end the war is mounting from all sides: US college campuses, international courts, American celebrities, Israel\u2019s Western allies, and even the families of the Israeli hostages. But the most significant of those may be the legal and diplomatic action taken against Israel this month. Israeli officials are scrambling to contain the fallout. They have accused critics of antisemitism and vowed not to relent in the face of international pressure. \u201cEven if Israel is forced to stand alone, we will stand alone, and we will continue to strike our enemies powerfully until victory,\u201d Netanyahu declared in a fiery speech at the opening ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day this month. Palestinian statehood For years, Israeli officials have opposed unilateral recognitions of Palestinian statehood, fearing it would enable the Palestinians to bring Israel before international courts and weaken its position in future peace negotiations. The Palestinians have therefore failed to gain full membership at the United Nations due to objections from the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally and primary defender on the world stage. However, a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly on May 10 showed overwhelming international support for an independent Palestinian state, leaving the US and a few of Israel\u2019s allies isolated. Israel and the US maintain that a Palestinian state should only be established through a negotiated settlement. But as Israel continues to reject the prospect of Palestinian independence, some states have chosen to act independently. This week, Ireland, Spain and Norway\u00a0announced\u00a0plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, saying they hope the move would prod other European nations to follow suit. \u201cWe live in a time in world history where doing the bare minimum is both heroic and insufficient. That is why we cannot stop,\u201d Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda D\u00edaz said in a video posted on her X page. \u201cPalestine will be free from the river to the sea,\u201d she added, using a pro-Palestinian protest slogan that Israel says calls for its destruction, a charge rejected by those who use it. The move prompted swift condemnation from Israel, which recalled its ambassadors from all three countries. Aside from international efforts to end the war, Netanyahu is also under intense pressure domestically to strike a deal with Hamas to bring back the hostages. With hostage-ceasefire talks stalled, relatives of the captives are pressing the prime minister to return to negotiation. This week, the families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas released graphic footage of their abduction to pile pressure on the government to secure their release. But there were signs that the talks may resume. On Thursday, the Israeli war cabinet directed the country\u2019s negotiating team to resume talks, without saying when they\u2019ll take place, and CIA Director Bill Burns has traveled to Europe to try to get the deal back on track, a US official told CNN, adding that the Israelis are \u201cvery engaged.\u201d Quandary for Israel\u2019s allies The cases brought before the ICJ and ICC have tested Western states\u2019 commitment to the rules-based international order as they struggle to navigate the increasing legal actions against their ally in these courts. This has created a rift between Israel\u2019s Western allies and a growing coalition of Global South countries spanning Asia, Africa, and South America that are increasingly vocal in their calls for Israel to be held accountable for its actions in Gaza. In a recent case at the ICJ, Germany was compelled to defend its arms sales to Israel against allegations of \u201cfacilitating genocide\u201d brought by Nicaragua. Despite the pressure, the court rejected the demand for an immediate halt to Germany\u2019s arms exports to Israel. Meanwhile, the ICC\u2019s decision to pursue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant has divided Israel\u2019s Western allies. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Karim Khan, the ICC\u2019s prosecutor, recounted a conversation with a senior leader who remarked: \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like Putin,\u201d underscoring the complexities surrounding international legal proceedings. While the US and the United Kingdom have denounced the move, European nations such as France, Germany, and others have affirmed the independence of the court and have not ruled out the possibility of arresting Israeli officials if they enter their territory following the issuance of a warrant. The court is also\u00a0pursuing warrants against three top Hamas officials: Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif. A panel of judges at the ICC is still deliberating on whether to issue these warrants. The response to the warrant request has been particularly fierce in the US Congress, where a bipartisan effort to penalize the ICC is underway, potentially including sanctions.\u00a0US Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to work with Congress on legislation to penalize the ICC. \u201cIf they do this to Israel, we\u2019re next,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has led the efforts against the ICC in Congress, told a Senate hearing this week \u2013 a reminder that however much pressure Israel is under, it still has one very powerful friend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-isolation-deepens-icj-gaza-rafah-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_asia_wwii-submarine-wreck-uss-harder-found-philippines-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The wreck of one of the most storied US Navy submarines of World War II has been found in the South China Sea eight decades after its last patrol, the Navy\u2019s History and Heritage Command said Thursday. The USS Harder lies under 3,000 feet (about 900 meters) of water off the northern Philippine island of Luzon, sitting upright and intact except for damage behind its conning tower from a Japanese depth charge, the NHHC said in a press release. Harder was lost in battle on August 24, 1944, along with its entire crew of 79 submariners, while on its sixth patrol of the war, as the US sought to retake the Philippines from occupying Japanese forces. \u201cHarder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,\u201d NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, a retired US Navy admiral, said in the press release. According to a US Navy history, Harder sank two Japanese escort ships off the Bataan Peninsula on August 22, 1944, and then headed north along the Luzon coast with two other subs in search of more targets. In a battle with Japanese escort ship CD-22 on the morning of August 24, Harder fired three torpedoes that missed and was later sunk by the Japanese ship\u2019s fifth depth charge attack, according to Japanese records cited by NHHC. The NHHC said the wreck of the Harder was confirmed by data provided by the Lost 52 Project, an effort led by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea, to find the 52 US subs lost in World War II. The group has previously located at least six WWII subs, the NHHC said. \u201cWe are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the \u2018Hit \u2018em Harder\u2019 submarine,\u201d the NHHC\u2019s Cox said, in reference to the vessel\u2019s motto. The NHHC said the wreck is \u201cthe final resting place of Sailors that gave their life in defense of the nation and should be respected by all parties as a war grave.\u201d The Philippines was a US territory attacked by Japan just after its strike on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. By the spring of 1942, US and Philippine forces on Luzon surrendered to Tokyo\u2019s forces and Japan used the captured archipelago to protect its supply lines from the East Indies and Southeast Asia. But by mid-1944, the US was rolling back Japanese gains across the Pacific, and was planning landings to do the same in the Philippines. Harder,  which had the motto of \u201cHit \u2018em Harder,\u201d was captained by Cmdr. Samuel Dealey, who would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, the US military\u2019s highest decoration, for his actions in Harder\u2019s fifth patrol, from March to July 1944. During that time Harder sank three Japanese destroyers with another two likely destroyed or heavily damaged over the course of just four days, according to the National Medal of Honor Museum. The museum\u2019s page on Dealey described one particularly harrowing encounter. Coming under attack from a Japanese destroyer, Dealey ordered a head-on torpedo shot at the bow of the charging enemy, known as a \u201cdown the throat\u201d shot, according to the museum account. \u201cAt 1,500 yards, Dealey fired three torpedoes and ordered the sub to dive.\u00a0\u00a0As the\u00a0Harder\u00a0passed 80 feet underneath the destroyer, two of the torpedoes struck the ship, sending shock waves through the submarine.\u201d On its first four patrols after commissioning on December 2, 1942, Harder sank 14 Japanese warships and merchant vessels, according to the Medal of Honor Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/asia/wwii-submarine-wreck-uss-harder-found-philippines-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_world-best-tourism-countries-world-economic-forum-2024", "text": "The United States has just won a significant honor \u2013 being named the world\u2019s best country for travel and tourism in 2024 by the World Economic Forum. The rankings are determined by a broad range of criteria, including infrastructure, natural resources, sustainability, labor availability and \u2013 since this is the World Economic Fund we\u2019re talking about \u2013 competitive pricing. Another thing to keep in mind is that the WEF data focuses on tourism \u2013 the business of hotels, airports, attractions, airlines and the like \u2013 and not just what it\u2019s like to be a traveler on the ground. Europe in the lead Six of the top 10 countries on the list are in Europe, with Spain the highest overall. The report calls the continent \u201ca resilient destination with strong intraregional travel flows,\u201d and gives it high marks for train connectivity. There are also points for having strong economies, the good position of the Euro and pound, and the likelihood of Europeans to travel more \u2013 which, in turn, means spending money. It\u2019s no surprise that France scores highly, landing in fourth position overall. The country knows it has the world\u2019s eyes looking its way ahead of the Summer Olympics in Paris this year. Another factor taken into account is the power of many European passports. Every year, the Henley Index ranks the world\u2019s most powerful passports, and their data has been included in the WEF report. For 2024, six countries share the number one ranking \u2013 France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore and Spain. Five of those nations appear in the WEF\u2019s top 10, with Singapore a respectable 13th. The scene in Asia \u201cIn 2024, global tourism growth is expected to be reinforced by the continued satisfaction of pent-up demand and growth in major Asian markets after travel restrictions have been lifted following a delay compared to other regions,\u201d says the report. That certainly feels true in Japan, this year\u2019s third-place country, which has been experiencing a tourism boom since reopening post-pandemic. More than three million foreign tourists per month went to Japan in both March and April 2024, with more expected to visit during the coming summer holidays. Meanwhile, eighth-place China has in recent months made some moves to make it easier for tourists to visit. In March, it dropped visa requirements for residents of several European countries, including Ireland, Switzerland and the Netherlands. It\u2019s also easier than ever for Americans to visit China, as they no longer need to provide an itinerary or proof of hotel bookings to get a travel visa. American beauty While the US is the only North American country in the top 10, neighbor Canada lands just off the chart in 11th position. According to the WEF, the US is a \u201cmature\u201d tourism market, meaning it already has infrastructure in place to welcome visitors, such as air links connecting cities and on-the-ground support like tour guides, rental cars, hotel rooms and maps. The US\u2019 size and scope really help it stand out: from national parks to big cities to great beaches, there\u2019s a big variety of offerings for travelers. However, there\u2019s one potential caveat amid the praise. The report says there\u2019s a likelihood that the US will experience a tourism labor shortage. Like many places around the globe, the pandemic played a big role in people leaving the hospitality business to work elsewhere. Good for tourism versus overtourism It seems impossible to look at a list of the most popular countries for tourists without also acknowledging that in some places too much tourism is the problem. The United States (in first place) and China have the advantage of being large and having lots of room to work with, which helps spread the flow of visitors. Not every destination in the top 10 is so lucky, though. In runner-up Spain, Barcelona voted to keep cruise ships away from the city center, while citizens of the Canary Islands have taken to the streets \u2013 and even threatened a hunger strike \u2013 to protest overtourism. Italy, in ninth position, has also struggled to balance its thriving tourism market with the needs of local communities. Venice began charging a \u201ctourist tax\u201d entry fee last month, and the northern region of Bolzano - South Tyrol has capped its hotel capacity, allowing a new hotel to open only if another has closed.

{"id": "2024_05_24_world_papua-new-guinea-landslide-intl-hnk", "text": "More than 100 people are feared dead in a remote village in the Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea after a landslide flattened homes and buried people alive while they were sleeping, officials said Friday. The disaster hit the village of Kaokalam in Enga Province, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, at about 3 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET, Thursday). The remoteness of the affected village, home to nearly 4,000 people, is hindering rescue efforts, according to the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country. \u201cThe debris is as big as approximately three to four football fields, and is blocking the lifeline of the province\u2019s main highway, which is making the relief efforts all the more difficult,\u201d Serhan Aktoprak told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s already dark. It\u2019s already night time in Papua New Guinea. There\u2019s no power to continue the relief efforts. Only with sunrise will the [IOM] teams be returning,\u201d Aktoprak said. He added that three\u00a0bodies had so far been recovered, but the death toll is likely to increase because of the size of the landslide. The number of people killed or missing is \u201cvery fluid,\u201d but more than 100 are believed to be dead, Janet Philemon, Caretaker and National Treasurer of the Papua New Guinea Red Crescent Society (PNGRCS), told CNN. The local community has been scrambling to reach survivors \u201cwith whatever tools they have at their disposal,\u201d Philemon said. \u201cThe community themselves are responding, trying to bring out and uncover those that have been buried under the landslide,\u201d she added. She said that an earthquake had hit the area a few days prior, which she believed could have contributed to the cause of the landslide. Footage of the aftermath carried by AFP showed a wide scar of mud and rocks on a steep mountainside slope and locals clambering to look for survivors. Prime Minister James Marape said in an earlier statement, reported by the ABC and Reuters, that his government had sent officials from the country\u2019s disaster agency, defence force, and Department of Works and Highways to meet Enga\u2019s provincial and district authorities, and carry out the rescue and relief efforts, as well as the reconstruction of infrastructure. \u201cI extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the landslide disaster,\u201d he said, In comments reported by the ABC, officials said houses were flattened when the side of a nearby mountain gave way. CNN has reached out to local authorities, including Ipatas, as well as the national police and the country\u2019s disaster management agency. A Pacific nation home to around 10 million people, Papua New Guinea is rich in resources, but its economy has long trailed those of its neighbors, and it has one of the highest crime rates in the world. Violence remains widespread. Chaos erupted in the capital earlier this year after police walked off the job in protest over a drop in their pay, which government officials later blamed on a computer glitch in the payroll system. Shops were looted and buildings set on fire during the disturbance. Hundreds of tribes are spread across the country\u2019s remote and often inaccessible terrain. But its vast and diverse mountainous landscape, as well as a lack of roads, has made it difficult and costly to upgrade basic services like water, electricity and sanitation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/papua-new-guinea-landslide-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_middleeast_israel-idf-hostage-video-hamas-intl", "text": "Families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas during the October 7 attacks have released graphic footage of their abduction as they pile pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure their release. The video shows the women \u2014 all Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel \u2014 lined up against a wall, their hands bound. The faces of some of the women are bruised and bloodied. The footage was previously released by Hamas, according to the Hostages Families Forum. The campaigning group obtained it from the IDF, which had previously edited the video to exclude the most disturbing scenes. \u201cEvery new testimony about what happened to the hostages echoes the same tragic truth \u2013 we must bring them all back home, now,\u201d the Hostage Families Forum said in a press release Wednesday. The\u00a0women were\u00a0kidnapped during a Hamas raid on Israel\u2019s Nahal Oz military base, near the northern Gaza Strip, as part of the militant group\u2019s attacks on Israel that left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave. Following the attack,\u00a0Israel\u00a0launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians\u00a0over the past seven months, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. The\u00a0kidnapped\u00a0women were working as IDF observers, a role that involves monitoring Israel\u2019s border security. Video of the ordeal has been made public as pressure mounts on Netanyahu to secure the release of the Israelis still held by Hamas,\u00a0which his government has made a key goal of the Gaza offensive. Numerous attempts to strike a hostage-for-ceasefire deal with Hamas have faltered in recent months, infuriating those in Israel campaigning for the return of the captives. \u201cThe State of Israel cannot accept a reality where its citizens constantly feel their lives are threatened and suffer from unrelenting fear and anxiety,\u201d the Hostages Families Forum\u00a0said\u00a0as it publicized the video on Wednesday. \u201cWith each passing day, it becomes more challenging to bring the hostages back home \u2013 the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial. The Israeli government must not waste another moment; it must return to the negotiating table today!\u201d Netanyahu\u00a0said Wednesday he is \u201chorrified by the video showing the abduction of our dear field observers.\u201d He said Israel will \u201ccontinue doing everything to bring them home\u201d and the \u201ccruelty of Hamas terrorists only enhances my determination to fight forcefully until the destruction of Hamas, to ensure that what we\u2019ve seen this evening will not happen ever again.\u201d War cabinet minister Benny Gantz said when he first watched the video it made his \u201cstomach turn.\u201d However, Gantz said, \u201cthe responsibility of leaders is not only to look reality in the eye \u2013 it is to create a different reality even when it comes to difficult decisions. And that is our responsibility.\u201d \u2018For the world to see\u2019 One of the women shown in the video, Ori Megidish, was\u00a0rescued by the IDF in a special operation\u00a023 days after being taken. Another, Noa Marciano, an IDF Corporal, was\u00a0killed while in Gaza\u00a0and her body was returned to Israel in November. But five of the seven \u2014 Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniela Gilboa, and Naama Levy \u2014 remain in captivity, more than seven months after being taken across the border. The mother of Naama Levy told CNN on Wednesday that bringing them home is not\u00a0a top priority of the Israeli government, saying some members of the government did not even watch the video. \u201cMinisters and\u00a0members of the government were asked to watch a version of this video in their meetings, and some of them refused and said we want to sleep OK at night,\u201d Ayelet Levy Shachar said, adding, \u201cSo if this is the reaction when it\u2019s their duty to watch these materials, this is their job, so they can make correct decisions, then we think that we should put it out there for our citizens, for the world to see.\u201d More than 100 hostages were freed during a release deal in November, but the IDF believes there are still around 130 people being held in Gaza. Efforts to reach a deal that would pause the war in Gaza and allow the release of hostages have repeatedly been dashed. Earlier this month, Hamas said Israel\u2019s rejection of a ceasefire plan submitted by mediators at negotiations in Cairo had sent hostage release talks back to \u201csquare one.\u201d The statement came a day after the latest round of Gaza truce and hostage deal talks ended in Cairo, without a deal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/israel-idf-hostage-video-hamas-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in the Thai capital is treating 22 patients with spine and spinal cord issues, six with skull and brain injuries, and another 13 for bone, muscle or soft tissue complaints, its director Adinun Kittiratanapaibool told reporters on Thursday. The doctor added that 17 patients had undergone surgery, including procedures from stitches to spinal operations. One person died in the incident. Passengers who spoke to the media after the plane made an emergency landing in Bangkok described how some passengers and crew were thrown around the cabin, their heads smashing into the overhead baggage cabins, and seeing people in shock with bloody wounds on their faces. Josh Silverstone, one of the passengers on the Singapore Airlines flight, described feeling \u201chappy to be alive\u201d as he was leaving the hospital on Wednesday evening. Speaking with journalists on his way out, the 24-year-old British citizen said he had suffered a cut on his eye and a chipped tooth in the turbulence, but that several passengers were in a much worse physical state than he is. Silverstone described the aftermath of the emergency landing in Bangkok, saying he started vomiting,\u00a0which prompted him to look for medical care. Flight SQ321 from London to Singapore was cruising at 37,000 feet on Tuesday when the plane\u00a0dropped sharply before climbing\u00a0several hundred feet, according to flight tracking data. It then repeatedly dipped and ascended for about a minute. Many passengers were having breakfast at the time of the incident. Video and images from inside the aircraft after its emergency landing in Bangkok showed the extent of the damage, with overhead compartments smashed open and emergency oxygen air masks dangling above the seats. A photo of one galley showed a section of the ceiling open with parts of the plane\u2019s interior hanging down. Trays, containers, plastic bottles and hot beverage pots can be seen strewn across the floor. After the incident, the plane \u2013 which was carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew \u2013 was diverted to Bangkok, where ambulances and emergency response teams were waiting. Those injured on the flight included citizens from Australia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Spain, the United States and Ireland, the hospital previously said. Of the total 104 passengers who were reported injured on the flight, 55 people remain in hospital. A 73-year-old British man with an existing heart condition died on board, though hospital officials haven\u2019t confirmed his cause of death.

The \u201cCode 9.2\u201d drone unit, from the 92nd assault brigade, are moving into a new launch position from where they\u00a0are about to\u00a0conduct a rare and\u00a0potent\u00a0mission: flying drones into Russia and dropping mines onto key roads inside enemy territory. Twilight provides a moment of opportunity to set up new equipment and unload their Humvee before dark makes these complex tasks impossible. They can only hope the grey, fading light shields them from the endless stream of Russian drones that fly overhead, looking for something to strike. A Starlink dish, a longer range drone antenna, dozens of battery packs, and two huge \u201cVampire\u201d quadcopters\u00a0are\u00a0dumped into trenches and bunkers, set up, and in use within 30 minutes. It is only when the dark has set in that their work can begin. And immediately the threat is apparent. Before operators Andrey and Artem can leave the bunker to begin work, a noise sends them rushing back in for cover. \u201cSssshhh,\u201d Andrey hisses. \u201cOrlan.\u201d The only way to protect yourself from being seen by an Orlan \u2013 a spotter drone that can also have thermal cameras enabling it to see in the dark \u2013 is to hide. And to silently listen for it to pass. \u201cThey will be flying all night,\u201d he says. The horizon is peppered with flashes \u2013 distant explosions.\u00a0Across its center twinkles the Russian city of Belgorod, now repeatedly hit by Ukrainian strikes. Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed his week-old offensive into Kharkiv region in Ukraine is partially aimed at creating a buffer zone along the border to protect a population whose safety was never in doubt when he launched his invasion in February 2022. The bunker is quickly turned into an operations hub, the team finding it hard to adjust to the silent open fields of their new home, after months of fierce battles around Bakhmut. In the silence, Artem says, \u201cyou don\u2019t know, will you get hit or not.\u201d He points out the difference with Ukraine\u2019s failed defense last year of Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region \u2013 and their work tonight, about\u00a0four miles from the border. Here\u00a0the heavy foliage, lack of fixed front lines and proximity to Russia means \u201creconnaissance groups enter and can get anywhere.\u201d They joke they could wake up to a Russian soldier standing over them. For Artem though this fight is intensely personal. His parents still live in a partially destroyed village a short drive away. For 18 months he deceived them\u00a0by saying\u00a0he was stationed at a peaceful checkpoint, when he was really fighting on the front lines. Now they know he is nearby, and the feeling of fighting for his actual home leaves him feeling unsettled. \u201cAnxiety,\u201d he says of the main feeling. \u201cMy parents are right here so if, God forbid, we fail somehow, if there is a breakthrough\u2026 it\u2019s a big responsibility.\u201d Dark has set in, punctured only by the flashes of artillery strikes and the near-full moon. The team move to work fast. Artem and Andrey race to attach the mines to the drone, using only red lights. Suddenly, a tiny whining noise is audible. \u201cRun,\u201d says Andrey, and they take cover in a nearby bunker. Spotted once, the trenches could become a target for airstrikes and artillery all night, and there is little chance to escape: they have no vehicle and racing across open ground on foot is perilous too. A few minutes pass. Flares illuminate an adjacent field. Battles are raging elsewhere too. The team resumes work. Zip ties prime fuses. Masking tape readies explosive. Then again, another drone passes close by, and they race again for shelter. Interrupted twice, and a little breathless from racing\u00a0for\u00a0cover, the team are finally ready to launch. Back in the bunker, the pilot Sasha can see fields flow below the Vampire on its night vision camera. He points out the border line, and then adds: \u201cNow, we are already in Russia\u201d. \u201cDid you bring your passport?\u201d quips Artem. \u201cI can go without a visa,\u201d replies Sasha. Being funny used to be the third team member\u2019s job, before the war dragged Ukrainians of disparate professions into trenches. Andrey was a comic, and briefly worked with Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 long before his days as a politician and Ukrainian president when he was a TV producer and actor \u2013 on his comedy show. \u201cHonestly, he had one of the best vibes among the people I met,\u201d he says. \u201cThe strongest energy. It is always interesting with him. We spent a lot of time together, one on one.\u201d It is a peculiar trait of the Ukrainian force, compared to their enemy: it is unlikely any of Putin\u2019s troops spent time on stage with the Kremlin head cracking jokes before the war. The drone flies deeper into Russia, and then warning messages ring out loudly in the bunker, on grating repeat, signalling that GPS jammers are at work. Sasha is briefly concerned they may lose the drone. The livestream cuts. He thumbs the controls agitatedly. But then minutes later, the signal is restored: the drone has flown through the interference, kept on course, and can now continue towards the target. Moments later, two packages drop from its underbelly. The mines sit on the road, and later the next day, the unit says, hit one armored car and a soft skin vehicle. As the drone approaches, the team have two problems. Firstly, its GPS system appears damaged and it crashes unceremoniously into the field, upside down. Secondly, they think they can see an Russian Orlan that appears to have followed the drone back into Ukraine, perhaps seeking their launch position. The team stay in shelter a few minutes, hoping the threat passes. Shells whistle overhead and crash into nearby fields. They retrieve the drone, but must rely on their spare until dawn, when daylight will give them a chance to assess the damage. The sorties continue, the team saying they hold the record for the most Vampire flights in one night of 24. But their target now is Russia itself, a powerful symbol of Kyiv\u2019s decision to take the fight back to Moscow, and the new, dangerous escalatory turns this conflict is taking in its third year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/ukrainian-drone-unit-russia-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads", "text": "The Federal Communications Commission is taking initial steps toward new rules that could require political ads on TV and radio to include disclaimers about the use of artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. \u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cToday, I\u2019ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are\u00a0required to make available\u00a0to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill\u00a0a yawning gap\u00a0in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from \u201cfraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,\u201d but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer,\u00a0Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked\u00a0a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the\u00a0AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released a blueprint\u00a0for legislative action. But many\u00a0policy analysts doubt\u00a0that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads,\u00a0requiring campaigns\u00a0to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its\u00a0in-house generative AI tools\u00a0for political advertising.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_middleeast_palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl", "text": "Ireland, Spain and Norway have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state next week, in a move that is likely to bolster the global Palestinian cause but further strain relations between Europe and Israel. The three European nations say their landmark decision is the best way to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, but it sparked swift condemnation from Israel, as its foreign minister ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors from those countries. Most of the world already recognizes Palestinian statehood. More than 140 out of 193 member states of the United Nations have made their recognition official. But only some nations in the 27-member European Union are among them. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told a Wednesday news conference in Dublin: \u201cToday, Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognize the state of Palestine. Each of us will now undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision.\u201d \u201cThere is never a wrong time to do the right thing,\u201d Harris later said, speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiana Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cIt was my government\u2019s preferred position to recognize a two-state solution as part of a peace process to bring that about, but sadly, unfortunately, such a comprehensive peace settlement now seems, in many ways, further away than it has ever been,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe believe you can\u2019t say you\u2019re in favor of a two-state solution and not recognize the very existence of two states,\u201d he added. The recognition will come into force in all three countries on May 28, according to Irish Foreign Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. Norway\u2019s\u00a0Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said that a Palestinian state was \u201ca prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cThere will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution,\u201d St\u00f8re said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state.\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez sought to characterize the decision as one that was not anti-Israel. \u201cThis recognition is not against the people of Israel and certainly not against the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in favor of Hamas. It\u2019s in favor of co-existence.\u201d The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials. \u201cThis step reflects Spain\u2019s keenness to support the Palestinian people and their inalienable and legitimate rights to their land and homeland,\u201d the office of the president of the Palestinian Authority said in response to Madrid\u2019s decision, as reported by Palestinian news agency Wafa. Hamas, the militant group which governs Gaza, urged other countries to follow suit and \u201crecognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and end the Zionist occupation of our land.\u201d But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recognizing a Palestinian state would be a \u201creward for terror.\u201d \u201cThis will be a terror state, which will attempt to perpetrate the onslaught of October 7 time and again, and to that we shall not agree,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding, \u201cthis evil must not be given a state.\u201d As Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to Spain, Norway and Ireland, he said, in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2014 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza\u00a0on October 7\u00a0after militants led by Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israel has come under fierce criticism for its war. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts condemned \u201cthe continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages taken by Hamas. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a035,647\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a079,852\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Two-state solution All three European leaders stressed the importance of having Palestinian statehood in reaching a two-state solution in the Middle East, a decades-long goal that the international community has failed to achieve. Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Martin said the decision came amid \u201cgrowing impatience\u201d with Israel\u2019s lack of political will for a two-state solution. \u201cThe integrity of that two-state solution has been undermined in recent years by the strategy of the Israeli government and, in particular, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared opposition to it,\u201d Martin told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest during a live interview. Meanwhile, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that Israel was wrong to see recognizing Palestinian statehood as rewarding Hamas. \u201cWe are sending the opposite signal. We are supporting the Palestine authorities which spring out of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] who renounce violence and who many decades ago promised to leave the violent struggle behind and work for peaceful settlement with Israel \u2014 a promise they have kept by the way,\u201d Eide said. Senior officials in the United States, a close ally of Israel, have insisted the only way to bring peace and stability to the region is through the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel\u2019s security. Lawmakers in Israel have long rejected those calls. Reacting to the news on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN that US President Joe Biden \u201cis a strong supporter\u201d of a two-state solution. The spokesperson added, however: \u201cHe believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\u201d France, meanwhile, said that now is not the \u201cright time\u201d for it to join its European neighbors in recognizing a Palestinian state. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Stephane S\u00e9journe, added that such a decision is not merely a \u201csymbolic issue or a question of political positioning\u201d but rather a \u201cdiplomatic tool\u201d in the service of a two-state solution. Germany, another one of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies, also questioned the decision. Michael Roth, the chair of the parliament\u2019s\u00a0Foreign Affairs Committee, posted on X: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state is an appropriate measure after the horrific massacres (by) Hamas (on) October 7 last year.\u201d Qatar, a key mediator in stalled ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, said it hopes \u201cfor more countries to recognize the State of Palestine,\u201d according to a statement from the foreign ministry. The foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia, another regional actor, called on \u201cmore countries to swiftly take the same stance.\u201d Ireland has a long history of being openly supportive of the Palestinian cause, consistently criticizing Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza before Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack in Israel. Since then, Israel\u2019s war in response has shredded huge parts of the Gaza Strip and drained critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine. \u201cI can say this to the people of Israel: we recognize the state of Israel. We recognize the state of Israel\u2019s right to live in peace and security. That is their right. The people of Palestine also must have an equivalent right to peace and security,\u201d Harris told Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cAnd let me also say this to the people of Israel: the Irish people know what it\u2019s like to have their national identity hijacked by a terrorist organization. The IRA was never the people of Ireland and Hamas is not the people of Palestine.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear and unequivocal that we condemn Hamas, that we condemn the most horrific barbaric massacre that Israel experienced on the 7th\u00a0of October. We call for the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages. But it is entirely possible to say what I have just said and also say the next bit which sadly some refuse to say: that what is happening in Palestine, what is happening in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe, that children are being starved, are being deprived of food and that there are children who will go to sleep in Gaza tonight not sure if they will wake in the morning,\u201d he added. A source familiar with the matter told CNN the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently considering further diplomatic steps against the three countries. Steps under consideration include cancelling visits of officials from these countries to Israel and revoking visas from diplomats, which will limit their ability to visit areas in the West Bank under control of the Palestinian Authority, the source said. Another step under consideration by Israel is to reach out to the US to seek diplomatic support in providing clarification from Norway, Ireland and Spain on their intended decision, and to ask the US to try and convince other countries to not follow suit. Pressure on Israel The planned recognition adds pressure on Israel after seven months of fighting, according to H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London. \u201cFor individual Palestinians on the ground in the Occupied Territories, it\u2019s not going to mean anything at all in the short term, perhaps in the medium term,\u201d Hellyer told CNN. \u201cIt is obviously political recognition by states that don\u2019t have a presence on the ground.\u201d Hellyer added that Israel risks becoming an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d given that Western nations are now beginning to recognize a Palestinian state.  Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 war, then withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005. The territory, home to some 2 million Palestinians, fell under Hamas\u2019 rule in 2007. After Hamas took control, Israel and Egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory, which is ongoing. Israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on Gaza. These severe restrictions have been fiercely criticized by international bodies, including Amnesty International,\u00a0who say\u00a0Israel has violated international law. The vast majority of the population in Gaza are descendants of 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were\u00a0forcibly expelled\u00a0from their homes during what Palestinians call\u00a0al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d of the 1948-49 war, in what is now Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_europe_french-macron-new-caledonia-intl-hnk", "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron is on his way to New Caledonia, a government official has said, after a week of deadly unrest in the Pacific archipelago. Macron was leaving Paris on Tuesday night and will \u201cset up a mission\u201d in the French territory, government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot told a press conference, without giving further details. He will be accompanied by Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin, Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, and Overseas Minister Marie Gu\u00e9venoux, Darmanin told the National Assembly. New Caledonia has been roiled by riots sparked by electoral changes from the national government. The unrest has killed at least six people, and has left a trail of burned cars and looted shops, with road barricades restricting access to medicine and food. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2013\u00a0who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Macron\u2019s visit comes as Australia and New Zealand deploy government planes to evacuate their nationals from New Caledonia and as hundreds more French security personnel have been deployed to assist in the unrest. France\u2019s High Commission of New Caledonia said Tuesday the airport remains closed for commercial flights until May 25. Thevenot said Tuesday that 1,000 more members of French security forces have arrived in New Caledonia to support the 1,700 personnel already on the island. Darmanin also told the French legislature the number of police and gendarmes in New Caledonia would soon reach 3,000. Also speaking to France\u2019s National Assembly, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday \u201cthe situation is starting to improve.\u201d Protests began May 13 involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted overwhelmingly in favor of the change. The proposed changes to the constitution add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. Supporters of the change say voter rolls will better reflect the current population. Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies. Many indigenous inhabitants continue to live with high rates of poverty and high unemployment to this day.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/french-macron-new-caledonia-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_africa_south-africa-elections-explained-intl", "text": "South Africans go to the polls on May 29 for what will likely be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. Polls show the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led the party to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The slide in popularity mirrors the challenges of liberation movements that have transitioned into governing parties across the continent. What could happen? If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. A loss of a simple majority would put significant pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa within his party, as he promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over leadership in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. Support for the ANC has been on a slow downward trend over the decades but at the last election in 2019 it dropped below 60% for the first time, with the party earning 57.50% of the vote. What\u2019s gone wrong for the ANC? South Africans have a lot to grumble about. Violent crime is on the rise. Murder is at a 20-year high; with someone killed in the country roughly every 20 minutes, according to the most recent quarterly police crime statistics. Many have lost faith in the police as part of a larger breakdown in trust in government. The Rainbow Nation has the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world \u2013 and it\u2019s growing.Meanwhile, rolling electricity blackouts, water outages, a crisis in education, and a lack of service delivery all weigh on the population. But high on the list of issues are the allegations of corruption and mismanagement that continue to damage the ANC. When Ramaphosa \u2013 Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as president, he pledged \u201cto work very hard not to disappoint the people of South Africa.\u201d But in 2022, Ramaphosa was himself forced to deny stealing money. \u201cCorruption has wounded our democracy and shaken people\u2019s faith in our institutions,\u201d he admitted in a November speech. \u201cIf corruption is not arrested, the greatest damage will not be in the funds stolen, the jobs lost, or the services not delivered. The greatest damage will be to the belief in democracy itself,\u201d he added. This year South Africa received its lowest score on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index. The index scores countries from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). South Africa received 41 \u2013 worse than China and Cuba at 42. What are the other key parties? The country\u2019s main opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), is led by John Steenhuisen and is seen by many as a party for White South Africans. For this election, the DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. If the polls are to be believed, the ANC may have to make the choice between forming a coalition with the Zuma-backed party \u2013 uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) \u2013 and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) or the DA. Steenhuisen, for his part, has not ruled out going into coalition with the ANC if it were to keep the EFF and MK out of government. The EFF is a populist far-left party led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It began as a splinter party of the ANC and espouses expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism. The EFF has shown support for the MK party and Malema recently said that he intends to \u201cgive the EFF vote to the ANC\u201d if it doesn\u2019t get 50% \u2013 on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance. Steenhuisen has described an ANC-EFF-MK pact as a \u201cdoomsday coalition.\u201d Talking of Zuma\u2026 The former president continues to be a thorn in Ramaphosa\u2019s side. After a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court after failing to appear before a corruption inquiry, the 82-year-old is now the leader of the MK party \u2013 and was up until this week top of their parliamentary list. The country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled Monday he is not eligible to run for parliament\u00a0until five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. The unanimous ruling capped months-long speculation and legal wrangling on whether he could stand for the country\u2019s top legislative body. His party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Zuma had been campaigning against what he perceives as Ramaphosa\u2019s failures and disillusioned ANC voters were lapping it up, according to polls. An April poll by the Johannesburg-based Social Research Foundation poll found the ANC may get 37% of the vote, while MK may garner 13%. However, the most recent polling from the same foundation puts support for the MK party at 10.5% and\u00a0the ANC at 44.8% on Monday.\u00a0This suggests the ANC may be winning back support and may only need a small coalition partner.  When will we know the final result? The final election results will be announced on Sunday 2 June, the IEC said. However, projections should give a sense of the result a day or two after polls close and the final result could be announced sooner if vote counting is completed earlier.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/africa/south-africa-elections-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

A fifth person, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications in the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The five Americans were each arrested in recent months in the British Overseas Territory, where\u00a0carrying firearms is prohibited.\u00a0Each is accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, southeast of the Bahamas. On Monday, Reschenthaler told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that he wants to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States.\u201d Reschenthaler continued: \u201cThey were innocent mistakes. Any other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d The Americans face a fine for violating the government\u2019s firearm ordinance in addition to the possible 12-year sentences, but the court could give lighter sentences if it determines there are exceptional circumstances relating to the offense, according to Smith, who also represents Evans. Evans is currently out on bail and was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, Smith said. The court is also expected to decide on a legal challenge Smith presented over the constitutionality of the legislation as it relates to how defendants can be sentenced, according to Smith. The group of American lawmakers who traveled to Turks and Caicos this week to push for the charges to be dropped said the arrested Americans had the ammunition in their luggage \u201cinadvertently.\u201d One of the US lawmakers, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, said in a statement on Monday, \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today.\u201d Reschenthaler said the minimum 12-year sentence that ammunition charges carry is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and that the Americans brought the ammunition unknowingly. Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratna said in a news release on Wednesday that Turks and Caicos values its relationship with the US and that the two countries work in \u201cstrong partnership to tackle shared threats in the region.\u201d The statement said Turks and Caicos did not target US citizens and called Reschenthaler\u2019s remarks about the congressional delegation\u2019s trip to the islands to meet with officials \u201chighly regrettable.\u201d \u201cHis characterisation of our meeting is not one we recognise,\u201d the statement read. \u201cOur discussions were professional and respectful with a focus on clarifying the legal position and the well-being of the individuals,\u201d the statement continued. The governor added that the mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms and/or ammunition is in place to protect those in the islands and that the law provides discretion in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d for the judge to impose a reduced sentence. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date, according to the statement. Premier: \u2018Law must be applied even-handedly\u2019 Misick said out of a total of 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the last six years, only seven were US citizens.\u00a0The premier said Thursday no special treatment should be given to any group. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. Bringing firearms or ammunition, including stray bullets, into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a statement from its government, CNN previously reported. People who violate the law face a minimum 12 years imprisonment, the US Embassy in the Bahamas said in an April advisory. While the US and Turks and Caicos work together in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d The government of Turks and Caicos, Misick said, would take \u201cdecisive and comprehensive action to preserve the safety and security of our nation,\u201d adding while the country does not manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding its way to the islands has increased. The appointed member of the opposition, Alvin Garland, expressed his concern over the American citizens who have been arrested in Turks and Caicos for possession of ammunition over the last six months. Garland said the islands\u2019 governor is correct in not interfering with the ongoing court cases in order to adhere to the government\u2019s separation of powers, but added he believes most, if not all, of the cases involving American tourists will fall into the \u201cexceptional circumstances category\u201d and sentences could be shorter than the mandatory 12-year minimum.

{"id": "2024_05_23_americas_mexico-stage-collapse-presidential-candidate-intl-hnk", "text": "Nine people were killed and a presidential candidate was briefly taken to hospital after a stage collapsed under heavy winds at a campaign rally in Mexico on Wednesday. Candidate Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez said he was not injured in the incident, which happened during his campaign event in the northeastern city of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. The governor of Mexico\u2019s Nuevo Leon state said at least 121 people were injured and has offered to pay for funeral and hospital costs for the victims. Among the dead is one minor, Governor Samuel Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda said in a post on X, adding that some of the injured are stable while others are undergoing surgery. \u201dWhat we experienced happened in just a few seconds: A gale came, a sudden wind, and unfortunately, it collapsed the stage, resulting in a fatal accident,\u201d \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez told Reuters. \u201cI first saw the musicians\u2019 drums, from the group that was going to play, were going to get blown away. When the others noticed, they ran in different directions; some jumped to the sides (of the stage), and I jumped back.\u201d Videos shared on social media showed the moment a strong gust caused the stage to collapse. \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez and his team can be seen running for cover as the structure, which included a large video screen, falls onto the stage and part of the audience area. Footage taken in the aftermath of the accident shows a large number of emergency vehicles at the scene, their lights flashing in the darkness, as injured people are carried away. The area was cordoned off and guarded by heavily armed security personnel. Nearby observations from Monterrey show there were thunderstorms that brought gusty winds to at least 40 to 50 kilometers (around 25 to 30 miles per hour). The stage location was likely impacted by a gust front, which is when gusty winds suddenly pick up and change direction from nearby thunderstorms. \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez later said he was suspending all campaign activities after the collapse but would remain in the state to monitor the situation and victims. \u201cWe have to have solidarity, there is nothing that can repair an accident, a damage of this nature, and [people] will not be alone in this tragedy and through the consequences that this tragedy will have in their lives,\u201d \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez said. The 38-year old congressman is representing the center-left Citizens\u2019 Movement party, and was named party candidate in January after Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda dropped out. Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda was forced to return to his duties as governor as political chaos erupted under his interim replacement, making his presidential campaign untenable. During his daily press conference, Mexico\u2019s President\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador sent  condolences to the victims\u2019 families and expressed his support for Citizens\u2019 Movement. \u201cWe know that they are not to blame,\u201d he said, calling for authorities to investigate. The vote looms Mexico is heading\u00a0toward its largest election\u00a0in history on June 2, which has been marred by spiking political violence and assassinations. The presidential vote is seen as a two-horse race between a former Mexico City mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, a close ally of the Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and a former senator Xochitl G\u00e1lvez who is representing the opposition coalition. With the two women far ahead in the polls, Mexico is almost certainly going to elect its first female president in June. An estimated 70,000 candidates have stepped forward to compete for more than 20,000 positions, including the national presidency and the governorships of nine states. So far this year,\u00a0at least\u00a028 candidates have been attacked, with 16 killed, according to\u00a0data through April 1 from\u00a0the research group Data C\u00edvica, a figure set to outpace even the bloodiest election cycles in\u00a0Mexico\u2019s past.  Speaking to reporters, \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez said Civil Defense teams had checked the \u201cstructure of the set\u201d prior to the event but that the severity of the wind gusts had caught organizers by surprise. \u201cThe weather conditions were very atypical: the rain didn\u2019t last for even five minutes \u2026 it wasn\u2019t even a storm, it was truly atypical what happened,\u201d he said. The presidential candidate said an investigation into the incident would take place. Governor Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda urged people in the area to stay indoors, warning of more strong winds, thunderstorms and rain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/americas/mexico-stage-collapse-presidential-candidate-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s buzziest new AI feature is raising concerns that it could potentially be misused in the wrong hands. This week, the company showed off a new tool called Recall for Windows computers that acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly pull up anything that\u2019s ever been on screen, such as documents, images and websites. It\u2019s different from a keyword search; the tool regularly saves screenshots of the user\u2019s screen and stores them directly on the device. It then uses AI to process the data and make it searchable. For example, if someone previously searched for a green dress or the name of a local ice cream shop, they can ask the feature to \u201crecall\u201d anything in their history that was shown on screen. Although so-called semantic search is a big step forward for AI, it comes at a time when the industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Jen Golbeck \u2013 a professor of AI at the University of Maryland who focuses on privacy\u00a0\u2013 said the recall feature could pose a potential \u201cnightmare\u201d if the device falls into the wrong hands. \u201cStuff may stay on your device, but that doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t get to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t have an option to protect yourself even if you use incognito mode or clear your history because the tool has access to everything that\u2019s been on your screen.\u201d The UK\u2019s independent regulator for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), told CNN it is investigating the tool \u201cto understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.\u201d \u201cWe expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose,\u201d the ICO said in a statement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CEO Satya Nadella told The Wall Street Journal in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s launch that web searches must only be done on Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser and that the screenshots never leave the user\u2019s computer. \u201cYou have to put two things together: This is my computer and this is my Recall \u2013 and it\u2019s all being done locally,\u201d he said. Geoff Blaber, CEO of market research firm CCS Insight, said that makes the issue less concerning. \u201cThe backlash by some to this feature isn\u2019t surprising, but it\u2019s an overreaction given that the data stays exclusively on the device and the user has full control,\u201d Blaber said. Someone can decide whether to turn the feature on during the device setup process and can customize and blacklist which apps and websites Recall can access. \u201cThese controls suggest the feature has been built with security and privacy at its core,\u201d he said. \u201cRecall won\u2019t appeal to everyone but the utility provided is likely to be significant.\u201d Potential for malicious uses But Golbeck cited times when that protection might not be enough, such as a journalist in a hostile country, a person trying to get out of an abusive relationship, someone searching for sensitive medical information or an employee whose boss wants to track them. She believes issues around the tool will likely impact the workplace the most. \u201cWe know jobs monitor what we\u2019re doing on their devices, but a lot of people will do a personal thing on their work computer and all of that will be archived and visible to an IT department, even if it just stays on device,\u201d she added. Golbeck said technology, despite the benefits, is too often developed without the consideration of malicious uses. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last 15 years is every single one of those potential malicious use cases comes to fruition in some way or another,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will want to use this cool feature without understanding the privacy risk \u2013 that there will be a permanent record of everything you do.\u201d Similar reactions to features such as biometric passwords, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans, have emerged in the past. Blaber said to overcome some of the initial concerns, Microsoft and its partners will need to prove the value, security and privacy of the product in the real world. Still, Michela Menting, a senior research director at ABI Research, believes the feature is a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for privacy. \u201cThe argument that hackers need physical access to even be able to manipulate Recall is short-sighted at best because there are plenty of highly ingenious ways threat actors could exploit such a valuable tool,\u201d she said. \u201cAll it takes is time and effort to find a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_25_uk_alderney-british-island-nazi-atrocities-intl-gbr", "text": "Alderney, a quiet British island in the English Channel known for its outstanding natural beauty, was once the site of the only Nazi camps\u00a0on British soil \u2013 and a hell on Earth for its thousands of inmates. A fresh inquiry, ordered by the UK\u2019s Special Envoy for Post Holocaust Issues,\u00a0Eric\u00a0Pickles, and led by a panel of experts, has sought to determine the exact death toll of prisoners and\u00a0laborers\u00a0on Alderney, while also bringing an end to the conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding the island. The findings were published on Wednesday and determined there were a greater number of deaths than initially documented following liberation, but found no evidence of a \u201cmini-Auschwitz.\u201d The inquiry also explored why the Nazi perpetrators \u2013 most of whom evaded justice \u2013 never stood trial in Britain. Stretching for three square miles, the island was occupied by the Nazis for most of World War II. During that time, three forced\u00a0labor\u00a0camps and a concentration camp called Lager Sylt were built. Nearly eight decades later, the fingerprints of Nazi occupation are still visible on the picturesque island, including bunkers, anti-tank walls and the notorious Water Lane tunnels constructed by the occupying forces to store munitions and fuel. According to its tourist board, the residents of Alderney \u2013 which has a population of just over 2,000 \u2013 gather once a year in May for a memorial service to commemorate the island\u2019s victims. Described by Pickles as housing the \u201cmost westerly concentration camp in the Third Reich,\u201d questions over the scale of horror that occurred on the island have persisted among locals as well as internationally \u2013 and the exact number of dead has never been clear, until now. The Channel Islands were the only British land the Germans occupied during World\u00a0War II.\u00a0Unlike Jersey and Guernsey \u2013 the other Nazi-occupied islands \u2013 Alderney was evacuated of nearly all of its residents, meaning the island does not have extensive war-time records. According to Pickles, the lack of records has led to unsubstantiated claims being made about Alderney and the war crimes that took place there. \u201cClaims of mass murder that anywhere else would be checked carefully have been accepted at face value,\u201d\u00a0Pickles \u2013 who has stressed the importance of historic accuracy regarding the Holocaust \u2013 said. \u201cThird- or fourth-hand testimonies of atrocities, without any supporting evidence, are given as a\u00a0fact\u2026 What\u00a0happened on Alderney was bad enough with its brutality, sadism and murder, without the need for embellishment.\u201d \u2018Unvarnished truth\u2019 Following the island\u2019s liberation from the Nazis, official figures from a post-war investigation put the death toll at 389. This figure has long been disputed. Historians, members of the Jewish community and members of the public have estimates ranging from hundreds to several thousand. Speculation has also been rife that the true scale of what happened on the island may have been deliberately concealed by the British government. The inquiry denies such theories. It found that the number of deaths in Alderney is unlikely to have exceeded 1,134, with a more likely range of deaths being between 641 and 1,027. In addition, at least 97 people died and one disappeared during transit to and from the island. The estimated minimum number of prisoners or\u00a0laborers\u00a0sent to Alderney throughout the German occupation stands between 7,608 and 7,812, the panel found. Alderney\u2019s camps, according to the inquiry, shared many of the traits of those in mainland Europe.\u00a0Laborers\u00a0were kept in atrocious conditions and forced to work long hours carrying out dangerous construction work. They were subject to beatings, maiming,\u00a0torture and\u00a0in some cases executions. The inquiry found that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d for arguing that many thousands of victims died. Assertions that Alderney housed an extermination center and constituted a\u00a0\u201cmini-Auschwitz\u201d\u00a0are also untrue, the panel found. \u201cPrisoners were treated appallingly, and life was cheap, but Alderney did not house a \u2018mini-Auschwitz\u2019; there was no extermination centre on the island,\u201d\u00a0Pickles said. He added, \u201cAnyone who claims so has never visited Auschwitz or understood the extent of the Nazi\u2019s death factories in Eastern Europe.\u201d Pickles believes overestimated death tolls at the hands of the Nazis can be damaging and play into the hands of Holocaust deniers. \u201cAt a time when parts of Europe are seeking to rinse their history through the Holocaust, the British Isles must tell the unvarnished truth,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cNumbers do matter. It is as much of a Holocaust distortion to exaggerate the number of deaths as it is to underplay the numbers.\u201d He added, \u201cExaggeration plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers and undermines the six million dead. The truth can never harm us.\u201d \u2018Egregious injustice\u2019 A separate section of the inquiry focused on the failure to prosecute war crimes committed in Alderney, something that it described as an \u201cegregious injustice.\u201d This was due to the British government\u2019s decision to hand the case over to the Soviet Union after World\u00a0War II\u00a0as the majority of victims were Soviet citizens. Research conducted by Anthony Glees, an academic\u00a0and adviser to Pickles,\u00a0found there had been a \u201csuccession of cover-ups\u201d on the part of the British government, which handed all Alderney\u2019s files of evidence over to the Soviet Union via the United Nations War Crimes commission on September 12, 1945. From there, the USSR decided to \u201cdo nothing with the evidence,\u201d according to Glees, meaning that the majority of perpetrators who had systematically tortured and in some cases murdered their victims escaped trial. Glees believes that this has deliberately been hidden from public view by the British government. He is calling on the government to issue an apology. \u201cIt seems scarcely understandable that Britain, of all countries, declined to try Nazi war criminals for appalling atrocities committed on British soil against citizens of some 30 nations,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the British authorities passed all the evidence that they had carefully collected in the so-called \u2018Alderney Case\u2019 to the\u00a0USSR\u2026\u00a0despite the USSR not having requested it and so, apparently, directly contravening Britain\u2019s international treaty obligations.\u201d According to Glee, the lack of trials of Alderney\u2019s war criminals has meant that justice was denied to victims and their families. Pickles, meanwhile, said the fact that the perpetrators never faced British justice is a \u201cstain on the reputations of successive British governments.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/uk/alderney-british-island-nazi-atrocities-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Al-Nazla school in Saftawy, on the outskirts of Jabaliya, was being used as a temporary shelter by people fleeing violence when the strike took place. An eyewitness, Saleh Al-Aswad from Jabaliya, told CNN that his son-in-law is being treated for injuries sustained during the attack.

CNN has reached out to the Israeli military but has not yet heard back. Healthcare system \u2018on its knees\u2019 News of the strike comes as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. In a statement on X Saturday morning, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned that Gaza\u2019s healthcare system \u201cis on its knees\u201d as access to hospitals and facilities shrink further amid supply shortages and Israeli attacks.

Existing hospitals are operating at more than four times their bed capacity, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, the agency said. \u201cShortages in fuel, medical supplies and equipment are threatening the ability of the remaining health facilities to operate,\u201d it added. So dire has the situation become that the director of the Kuwait hospital in Rafah posted a video plea on WhatsApp, to \u201csound the alarm to the WHO to keep this hospital operational and to guarantee it doesn\u2019t shut down by providing it with the necessary fuel.\u201d In his video appeal, Dr. Suhaib al-Homs says the Kuwait Hospital is now the only functioning hospital in central Rafah injured members of the public can reach \u201caround the clock,\u201d as the surrounding field hospitals are difficult to access without an ambulance. \u201cWe are warning of the mounting health crisis as hospitals are going out of service and the collapse of the health sector,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will keep on working and the medical teams will keep doing their job. What\u2019s happening now makes us more steadfast and adamant to fulfill our duty to serve our people.\u201d The UN aid agency has warned that some displaced people in central Gaza are now surviving on 3% of the minimum standard for daily water needs and that communicable diseases, including diarrhea and suspected Hepatitis A, continue to increase with children under the age of five being particularly affected.

{"id": "world_americas_mojave-desert-seed-bank-mdlt-california-climate-c2e-spc", "text": "Inside a Mojave aster flower, a tiny bee is fast asleep. At night, the pale lavender petals close, providing a safe resting place. In the morning, as birdsong rings out across the desert, the flower opens, revealing its tenant. Here in southern California, in the middle of the Mojave Desert\u2019s vast and arid landscape, it\u2019s just one of many natural treasures hidden from view. In long sleeves, pants, and wide-brimmed hats to guard against a harsh sun in a cloudless blue sky, a team of four led by Madena Asbell crouches in the dirt, looking for another treasure. They are searching for a plant called erodium texanum, (common names Texas stork\u2019s bill or heronbill), a type of herb native to California. More specifically, they are looking for its seeds. \u201cThere\u2019s so much life here,\u201d Asbell says, \u201cbut it\u2019s easy to not realize that when you\u2019re in the desert.\u201d Asbell is the director of plant conservation for the Mojave Desert Land Trust (MDLT), a non-profit land conservancy that works to preserve and protect the Mojave and Colorado desert landscapes of California. A quarter of the state is desert, home to roughly 2,400 plant species, according to MDLT. Eight years ago, Asbell had an idea. What if there was a way to preserve the ecosystem, centered around the seeds that facilitate all the life here? The result was the Mojave Desert Land Trust seed bank. \u201cThe goal is to preserve this amazing genetic diversity that we have and make it available for restoration or reintroduction of species, should there be a disaster that wipes out a population,\u201d Asbell says. \u201cPlants are the foundation of most ecosystems, so when we protect these plants, we\u2019re protecting everything that depends on them, like desert tortoise, burrowing owls and pollinators.\u201d Five million seeds, and counting In an ever-changing climate, the seed bank was just the type of \u201cproactive\u201d idea the organization was looking for, says Kelly Herbinson, executive director of MDLT. \u201cAs a land trust, we\u2019re realizing that just protecting land or buying land to protect it wasn\u2019t going to be enough \u2013 that we had to take extra steps to really invest in that land,\u201d Herbinson says. In 2016, Mojave Desert Land Trust officially launched the seed bank project, which has since been described as a \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark\u201d for southern California. Three white refrigerators at MDLT headquarters in Joshua Tree, California, house the collection. There are over 5 million seeds from nearly 250 species and counting, according to the land trust. Seeds come in from the field teams and undergo a \u201ccut test\u201d to determine viability \u2013 confirming the seed pods are full, and that there hasn\u2019t been too much damage from insects or mold, making the seeds worth saving. They then go into paper bags on racks to dry out, before going into jars in the refrigerators for long-term storage. All types of jar shapes and sizes pack the shelves inside, from small, donated Gerber baby food jars to larger pickle jars \u2013 each adorned with white labels including seed name, number of jars in the collection, and number of seeds. Much like the desert itself, the seed bank contains all kinds of variation. Some seeds are light and wispy; some are skinny or round. Others are denser, like peppercorn, while another resembles pumpkin seed. There are shades of brown, red and olive green. Asbell says that work at the seed bank includes scouting, collecting, processing and database management. Last year, MDLT received a $3.2 million grant from the state of California\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Board to help expand the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been able to provide seed to researchers who are studying the effects of climate change on specific species that we have in our seed bank,\u201d Asbell adds. \u201cAnd knowing not only what you\u2019ve collected, but where it has come from in a really specific way is very important for restoration. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw any seeds on the ground \u2026 You need to know where that seed has come from, what population, what elevation, and make sure that it\u2019s the right seed for the right place. Those are things that we are able to do through the work that we\u2019re doing.\u201d Helping the future of the Joshua tree There is an increased urgency to that work. California has felt the impacts of climate change, from more frequent and intense wildfires, says Herbinson, to an influx of invasive grasses that are not only choking parts of the desert landscape but acting as fuel for the wildfires. \u201cClimate change brings drought and more prolonged drought, which really stresses desert ecosystems, even though they are adapted for aridity,\u201d Asbell says. \u201cWe\u2019re facing really unprecedented challenges that threaten our existence and to be able to preserve the genetic diversity of the planet for a future time when it may be needed is really amazing \u2013 it\u2019s really critical work,\u201d she adds. The desert itself is \u201cthe kind of place where you can pass it by and look at it and think there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d Herbinson says. \u201cBut in reality, it\u2019s incredibly biodiverse and full of so much life. It\u2019s just secret and hidden in ways that aren\u2019t obvious.\u201d That means it\u2019s not as well protected as other ecosystems, she adds, such as rainforests or oceans \u2013 which come with more colorful trees and wildlife. Yet the Mojave Desert boasts an iconic tree of its own: the Joshua tree. \u201cWe have this incredible endemic species that\u2019s very charismatic and has this very kind of unusual structure to it,\u201d Asbell says. \u201cIt\u2019s widespread across the landscape, but also very threatened and so we\u2019re very concerned about the future of the Joshua tree and working really hard to protect it.\u201d A type of yucca, the twisted, Dr. Seuss-like tree, which lends its name to a national park in the same area is \u201cnot likely to persist through our changing climate,\u201d Herbinson agrees, \u201cbecause their seeds are dispersed largely by rodents.\u201d To survive, there will likely come a time when the trees will need to migrate to a more \u201csuitable habitat,\u201d she adds \u2013 ideally cooler and at higher elevation. But that distance is beyond the range of the rodents, who only disperse seeds up to 100 feet from the tree. That\u2019s where the seed bank could help. \u201cIt means we can help the Joshua tree migrate potentially faster than it would naturally, and have that species survive the changing climate well into the future in a way that it wouldn\u2019t if we weren\u2019t doing that work,\u201d Herbinson says. Roughly 70,000 Joshua tree seeds are currently preserved in the seed bank, some of which could be planted in cooler locations, if needed. The key, according to Asbell, is balance: taking just the right amount to sustain a restoration project in the event of an emergency, but not so much as to disrupt the natural ecosystem. \u201cThis is an ancient landscape, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty profound to think about how long-lived a lot of these organisms are, and how much history they\u2019ve experienced.\u201d \u201cSeeds are life,\u201d Asbell adds, \u201cand I don\u2019t know that anything brings me as much pleasure as growing a seed. \u2026 It\u2019s life affirming. And in the world we live in today, you have to really hold onto that and keep that close.\u201d CNN\u2019s Adeline Chen contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/americas/mojave-desert-seed-bank-mdlt-california-climate-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

Born to a Filipino mother and African American father, the 24-year-old\u2019s win was celebrated on social media as helping to \u201cshatter\u201d traditional beauty ideals long held in the country. \u201cChelsea\u2019s win challenges our ingrained preference for Eurocentric beauty (features) and lighter complexions in our nation,\u201d wrote one user in response to an Instagram post of the win on Miss Universe Philippines\u2019 official account. \u201cFilipino beauty standard shattered into pieces,\u201d read another. Representing Bulacan, a province to the north of Manila, Manalo beat out 52 other contestants from around the archipelago and overseas. The competition was held at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. As the competition narrowed down to the top five finalists, Manalo was asked on stage how she would use her beauty and confidence to empower others. \u201cAs a woman of color, I have always faced challenges in my life. I was told that beauty has standards, actually,\u201d she said, adding that she was taught to \u201cbelieve in my mother, to always believe in yourself, uphold the vows that you have.\u201d \u201cBecause of these, I am already influencing a lot of women who are facing me right now,\u201d she said, gazing out to the packed arena. Manalo\u2019s win is part of a wider conversation about diversifying notions of beauty in the Philippines, a country where certain Western ideals have long persisted, shaped in part by the country\u2019s colonial past. Lighter-skinned actors and models typically star in major TV shows, movies and fashion campaigns and as common in other Asian countries, skin lightening treatments and products are pervasive. Manalo, who began modeling at 14, described her own insecurities growing up, in a YouTube video on Empire Philippines, which livestreamed the event. \u201cI grew up having insecurities as I was always bullied because of my skin and my hair type,\u201d she said, crediting her friends and family for helping her \u201crealize that I am beautiful in my own extraordinary way.\u201d Manalo will represent the Philippines in the Miss Universe pageant to be held in Mexico in September. She is vying to earn the fifth title for the country, following the footsteps of Gloria Diaz in 1969, Margie Moran in 1973, and Pia Wurtzbach in 2015 (after host Steve Harvey initially declared the wrong winner.) Catriona Gray was the last Filipino to win the title in 2018. Over 100 countries will be represented at Miss Universe 2024. This year will see the competition remove any upper age limit set for its contestants \u2014 previously, those competing were required to be between the age of 18 and 28. The Miss Universe organization has come under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the parent company of the Miss USA organization.

Pope Francis has recognized a second miracle attributed to Acutis, a gamer and computer programmer who died from leukemia in 2006 at age 15. During his life, Acutis used his technological skills to spread awareness of the Catholic faith, including setting up a website documenting miracles. Born in London 1991, he later moved to Milan, Italy with his family. Although Acutis\u2019 parents were not religious, the young boy\u2019s faith was nurtured by his Polish nanny. After his death, his body was moved to the Italian town of Assisi, where it is now displayed in a shrine, alongside other relics linked to him. Prospective candidates for sainthood normally need to have two miracles attributed to them before they can be canonized. The latest miracle attributed to Acutis relates to the reported healing of a girl from Costa Rica who had suffered a head trauma after falling from her bicycle in Florence, Italy, where she was studying.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_world_crows-can-count-study-scn", "text": "Perhaps \u201cbirdbrained\u201d isn\u2019t such an insult after all \u2013\u2013 crows, the ubiquitous urban bird, can vocally count up to four, the latest research has found. Not only can the inquisitive creatures count, but they can match the number of calls they make when shown a numeral, according to a new study, led by a team of researchers with the University of T\u00fcbingen\u2019s animal physiology lab in Germany. The way the birds recognize and react to numbers is similar to a process we humans use, both to learn to count as toddlers and quickly recognize how many objects we\u2019re looking at. The findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, deepen our growing understanding of crow intelligence. \u201cHumans do not have a monopoly on skills such as numerical thinking, abstraction, tool manufacture, and planning ahead,\u201d said animal cognition expert Heather Williams via email. \u201cNo one should be surprised that crows are \u2018smart.\u2019\u201d Williams, a professor of biology at Williams College in Massachusetts, was not involved in the study. In the animal kingdom, counting isn\u2019t limited to crows. Chimpanzees have been taught to count in numerical order and understand the value of numerals, much like young children. In attempting to woo mates, some male frogs count the number of calls from competing males to match or even one-up that number when it\u2019s their turn to croak at a female. Scientists have even theorized that ants retrace their paths back to their colonies by counting their steps, though the method isn\u2019t always accurate. What this latest study showed is that crows, like young humans, can learn to associate numerals with values \u2013\u2013 and count out loud accordingly. Can crows count much like toddlers do? The research was inspired by toddlers learning to count, said lead study author Diana Liao, a neurobiologist and senior researcher at the T\u00fcbingen lab. Toddlers use the words of numbers to tally the number of objects in front of them: If they see three toys in front of them, their counting could sound like \u201cone, two, three\u201d or \u201cone, one, one.\u201d Maybe crows could do the same, Liao thought. She was inspired, too, by a June 2005 study on chickadees tailoring their alarm calls to a predator\u2019s size. The larger a predator\u2019s wingspan or body length, the fewer \u201cdee\u201d sounds the chickadees used in their alarm call, the study found. The opposite was true for smaller predators \u2013\u2013 the songbirds would use more \u201cdee\u201d sounds if they encountered a smaller bird, which could be greater threats to chickadees since they are more agile, Liao said. The authors of the chickadee study couldn\u2019t confirm whether the small songbirds had control over the number of sounds they made or if the number of sounds were an involuntary response. But the possibility piqued Liao\u2019s curiosity \u2013\u2013 could crows, whose intelligence has been well-documented over decades of research, show control over their ability to produce a certain number of sounds, effectively \u201ccounting\u201d like toddlers do? The crows planned their number of caws Liao and her colleagues trained three carrion crows, a European species closely related to the American crow, over more than 160 sessions. During the trainings, the birds had to learn associations between a series of visual and auditory cues from 1 to 4 and produce the corresponding number of caws. In the example researchers provided, a visual cue might look like a bright blue numeral, and its corresponding audio could be the half-second song of a drumroll. The crows were expected to perform the same number of caws as the number represented by the cue \u2013\u2013 three caws for the cue with the numeral 3 \u2013\u2013 within 10 seconds of seeing and hearing the cue. When the birds had stopped counting and cawing, they would peck at an \u201center\u201d key on the touchscreen that presented their cues to confirm that they were done. If the birds had counted correctly, they\u2019d receive a treat. It appeared that as the cues continued, the crows took longer to react to each cue. Their reaction times grew as \u201cmore vocalizations were impending,\u201d Liao wrote, suggesting that the crows planned the number of caws they were going to make before they opened their beaks. The researchers could even tell how many calls the birds planned to make by the way their first call sounded \u2013\u2013 subtle acoustic differences that showed that the crows knew how many numbers they were looking at and had synthesized the information. \u201cThey understand abstract numbers \u2026 and then plan ahead as they match their behavior to match that number,\u201d Williams said. Even the mistakes the crows made were somewhat advanced: If the crows had cawed one too many times, stuttered over the same number or submitted their responses with their beak prematurely, Liao and her researchers could detect from the sound of the first call where they went wrong. These are the \u201csame kinds of errors humans make,\u201d Williams said. We\u2019re still learning how smart crows are Birds and many other animals were previously thought to make only on-the-spot decisions based on stimuli in their immediate environments, a theory popularized by the 20th century animal behaviorist B.F. Skinner. But the latest research by Liao and her colleagues provides more evidence about crows\u2019 ability to synthesize numbers to produce a sound and suggests that the skill is within their control. The study team\u2019s findings are highly specific but still significant \u2013\u2013 they challenge the once common belief that all animals are merely stimulus-response machines, said Kevin McGowan, a researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, who has spent more than two decades studying wild crows in their habitats. McGowan wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study, McGowan told CNN, demonstrated that \u201ccrows aren\u2019t just simple nonthinking machines out there reacting to their environment \u2013\u2013 they\u2019re actually thinking ahead and have the ability to communicate in a structured, preplanned way. It\u2019s sort of a necessary precursor for having a language.\u201d Crow intelligence has been studied for decades. Scientists have investigated New Caledonian crows creating their own compound tools to access food. The birds appear to establish rules, according to a November 2013 study coauthored by the University of T\u00fcbingen lab\u2019s lead researcher, Andreas Nieder. Crow language has confounded scientists for decades, too, with its widely varying tones and expressions, McGowan said. The study by Liao and her colleagues isn\u2019t even the first to consider whether crows can count. That research began with Nicholas Thompson in 1968, animal cognition expert Irene Pepperberg noted. A research professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, Pepperberg is best known for her work with an African grey parrot named Alex. Thompson hypothesized that crows could count based on their caws, the duration and number of which the birds appeared to control in a given burst of sound. The crows\u2019 counting abilities \u201cseem to exceed the demands which survival makes for such abilities,\u201d he wrote. Another University of T\u00fcbingen study on crows\u2019 counting abilities from September 2015 trained the birds to recognize groupings of dots and recorded the activity of neurons in the part of the crows\u2019 brains that receives and makes sense of visual stimuli. The researchers found that the crows\u2019 neurons \u201cignore the dots\u2019 size, shape and arrangement and only extract their number,\u201d the university said in a statement at the time. \u201cSo, crows\u2019 brains can represent different quantities, and crows can quickly learn to match Arabic numerals to those quantities \u2013\u2013 something humans usually explicitly teach their children,\u201d Williams said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/crows-can-count-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_weather_memorial-day-weekend-forecast", "text": "The National Weather Service has issued a tornado watch for parts of three states, labeling it a \u201cparticularly dangerous situation,\u201d a rare designation indicating the possibility of exceptionally strong storms. The tornado watch covers parts of northern Texas, much of central Oklahoma and south-central Kansas. It will expire at 11 p.m. CT. The watch calls for several tornadoes \u2013 a few intense ones likely \u2013 over an area that includes cities such as Wichita, Kansas, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This is a special kind of tornado watch issued only when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple at least EF2-strength and long-lived tornadoes in the area, according to the National Weather Service. Another tornado watch was added to portions of Kansas until 1 a.m. CT, affecting half a million people, according to the Storm Prediction Center. More than 4.5 million Americans were under tornado watches Saturday evening. The supercell thunderstorms firing up in the watch area will also be capable of extremely large hail up to the size of grapefruits and damaging wind gusts to 80 mph. An EF4 tornado \u2013 the third such violent tornado this year \u2013 killed at least four people in Greenfield, Iowa, Tuesday and left parts of the city in ruin. More strong tornadoes \u2013 at least EF2-strength \u2013 are possible Saturday in parts of the Plains and Sunday in portions of the Midwest. Some tornadoes Saturday could be particularly violent and exceed EF4-strength, the Storm Prediction Center warned Friday. Supercell thunderstorms that began firing up Saturday could be capable of producing a couple tornadoes, scattered large hail up to the size of softballs and damaging wind gusts to 70 mph, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Dangerous storms are expected to rumble to life in the evening in parts of western Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Storms will expand in both scope and strength in the evening and overnight and move east into the Mississippi Valley. A Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place Saturday for a large swath of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Wichita, and far western Missouri. \u201cViolent tornadoes, extreme hail and corridors of widespread wind damage\u201d are most likely within this area, according to the SPC, but could extend beyond it. Anywhere from Texas through Nebraska to the Mississippi Valley could encounter storms unloading strong wind gusts, hail and tornadoes. Robust thunderstorms will continue over parts of the Mississippi Valley through Sunday morning before gradually losing their strength. But a new round of damaging storms is expected to arrive quickly after. Thunderstorms will develop over portions of the Midwest by Sunday afternoon and develop farther south and east through the evening and overnight hours. Powerful storms could ultimately stretch from the Great Lakes to the South Sunday night. Damaging wind gusts and hail will be the main hazards with any severe thunderstorm Sunday, but some could produce tornadoes. At this time, the greatest tornado threat is in parts of the Midwest, especially during the afternoon and evening. The travel hubs of Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Nashville could have to contend with damaging storms, leading to delayed or cancelled flights. Thunderstorm activity will likely continue for Memorial Day Monday and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel for a large part of the East. Some of these thunderstorms could become severe, but it\u2019s not yet clear how widespread the threat will be. Even in the absence of damaging wind gusts, hail or tornadoes, lightning is a serious threat for any outdoor plans like picnics, pool parties or beach trips. Unofficial start of summer will officially feel like summer Meanwhile, dangerous storms and searing heat will\u00a0continue affecting vast portions of the United States this Memorial Day weekend and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel. A near-record number of people will travel this weekend in what could be the busiest period in nearly two decades, according to AAA. Travelers will have to contend with a hazardous and disruptive multi-day severe thunderstorm event with damaging winds, dangerous hail and strong tornadoes. It is expected to unfold this weekend in portions of the central, southern and eastern US. Severe weather has been unrelenting in May, but hit an even more\u00a0frenetic pace\u00a0this week. Nearly 850 wind damage reports and at least 80 tornado reports have occurred across the US since Sunday. While severe storms pound inland areas this weekend, some coastal areas will face a different threat. A heaping serving of summerlike heat is on the menu as many head to the beach to celebrate the unofficial start of summer. It\u2019s already been record hot in parts of the South this month, especially in South Texas and South Florida, the type of extreme heat made more likely by human-caused climate change. Record heat will expand over the weekend and jeopardize daily high temperature records in jeopardy from Texas through the Southeast as air temperatures soar well into the 90s. Houston, New Orleans, Miami, Mobile, Alabama, Tampa, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, are just a few cities along the Gulf and southeast Atlantic coasts where it\u2019ll feel more like July than late May through Memorial Day. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could approach triple-digits along the southern tier of the US, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. For those out in the heat, it\u2019s important to stay hydrated and be vigilant for signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat index values skyrocketed well into the 100s this week in southern Texas and could climb higher into seriously dangerous territory through Monday. The heat index is expected to max out between 110 and 120 degrees in southern Texas, including in Corpus Christi and Laredo, according to the National Weather Service.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/weather/memorial-day-weekend-forecast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_china-military-drills-taiwan-second-day-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u2019s military drills around Taiwan are designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over the island, the People\u2019s Liberation Army said Friday as its forces kicked off a second day of large-scale exercises encircling its democratic neighbor. The drills are the largest in more than a year and come just days after Taiwan swore in its new president, Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. Beijing has denounced Lai as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d and decried his inauguration speech on Monday, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan, which has grown much more pronounced under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The PLA, which dwarfs Taipei\u2019s outgunned military, kicked off the exercises on Thursday morning, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in\u00a0what it called \u201ca strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.\u201d On Friday, the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to \u201ctest the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.\u201d China\u2019s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But Xi, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in a generation, has made clear the island\u2019s \u201cinevitable reunification\u201d with the mainland cannot be put off indefinitely. The two-day exercises, involving joint operations of China\u2019s army, navy, air force and rocket force,\u00a0are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan, according to the PLA. For the first time, the PLA drills also involved China\u2019s Coast Guard, operating in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off the southeastern coast of China. CCTV aired footage on Friday that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire. Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry has condemned China\u2019s military exercises as \u201cirrational provocations\u201d and dispatched its own sea, air and ground forces in response. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, including 35 that crossed the Median Line, an informal demarcation point in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. A total of 19 Chinese warships and seven coast guard vessels were detected near the Taiwan Strait, according to the ministry. Taiwan\u2019s presidential office said Thursday it is \u201cregrettable to see China threatening Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations,\u201d adding Taiwan has the \u201cconfidence and ability to protect national security.\u201d First week in office Lai has had a busy and politically turbulent start to his presidency after taking over from two-term leader Tsai Ing-wen, to kick off a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The PLA\u2019s drills pose the first real test for the veteran politician in managing tensions with Beijing, which has refused his offer to talk and to resume cross-strait tourism and student exchanges. On Friday, China\u2019s Defense Ministry accused Lai of pushing Taiwan into \u201ca dangerous situation of war\u201dand \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d \u201cThose who play with fire will burn themselves,\u201d ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters, using rhetoric China frequently deploys for Taiwan\u2019s government. \u201cWhenever \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 (forces) provoke us, we will push our countermeasures forward until the complete reunification of the motherland is achieved.\u201d Domestically, Lai is facing chaos in the legislature, where opposition parties who favor closer ties to China hold a majority, and have pushed to subject his administration to tighter scrutiny. Thousands of mostly young people have taken to the streets to protest the opposition\u2019s attempt to fast-track the proposed bills to grant the parliament more power. But despite Beijing\u2019s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China\u2019s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years. \u201cWe are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,\u201d\u00a0an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN. \u201cIf the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won\u2019t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.\u201d A 42-year-old mother, who gave her surname Tsai, said she wasn\u2019t even aware the PLA drills were taking place. \u201cI believe leaders will prioritize people\u2019s happiness, so I\u2019m not worried. I think peace will be maintained,\u201d she said. \u2018Blockading Taiwan\u2019 China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally, and state media has ramped up coverage of the drills. Zhang Chi, a Chinese military expert, told China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV that the PLA\u2019s exercises focused on \u201cpracticing a new mode of blockading Taiwan.\u201d \u201cTaiwan is an isolated island, suspended in the sea with weak self-sufficiency. Taiwan\u2019s economy is export-oriented, and most of its energy consumption relies on imports. Once besieged and blockaded, it can easily lead to economic collapse, turning it into a dead island,\u201d he said. The exercises to the south of Taiwan are crucial for the blockade, targeting Kaohsiung port, Taiwan\u2019s largest port and an important base for the island\u2019s navy, Zhang said. Meanwhile, drills to the east of Taiwan are designed to practice cutting off the island\u2019s energy imports, the escape routes for \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d forces and the support line from the US and its allies, he added. The US maintains close but informal relations with Taiwan and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself. Zhang also noted that the drills had achieved \u201ca new breakthrough\u201d by entering waters near Wuqiu\u00a0and Dongyin, which hold significant geographical importance. \u201cThe Taiwanese military views them as the front outposts for Taiwan Strait defense operations. This exercise further squeezed the activity space of the Taiwanese military,\u201d he said. Analysts said the China Coast Guard movement close to and around the outlying islands was an important new aspect of the current drills, which follow previous encirclement exercises in August 2022 and April 2023. \u201cThe pressing of Coast Guard and other forces into waters close to those offshore islands is provocative,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. He said he expected such Chinese activities to continue and that they \u201cwill become the norm,\u201d with Beijing at any point able to then turn an exercise into a real military operation. Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said China\u2019s pattern of exercises around Taiwan does not signal an imminent invasion threat. \u201cThese drills aid in blurring the lines between peace and war, so much so that future exercises could be used as a pretext for an actual invasion,\u201d Singleton said. But Singleton and others say the exercises are sending a bigger political message than a military one. \u201cJoint Sword - 2024A aims at reactivating the military pressure lever to assert a degree of influence on the new (Taiwan) administration and its narrative,\u201d said Lionel Fatton, assistant professor of international relations at Webster University in Geneva, using China\u2019s name for this week\u2019s drills. Beijing will use the pressure of the drills to try to increase divisions within Taiwan, which could \u201cweaken\u201d the island from the inside, he said. \u201cConstant and visible\u00a0military pressure on the island will also help polarize the political apparatus, if not the social fabric itself,\u201d Fatton said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-military-drills-taiwan-second-day-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_africa_djibouti-releases-gene-modified-mosquitoes-intl", "text": "Genetically engineered mosquitoes have been released in the tiny East African country of Djibouti to combat a surge in malaria infections caused by an invasive vector. This initiative started on Thursday, comes as Djibouti, one of\u00a0Africa\u2019s smallest nations\u00a0with just over a million residents, grapples with a dramatic increase in malaria cases, skyrocketing\u00a0from just 27 in 2012 to\u00a0more than 70,000\u00a0in recent years, according to the WHO. The\u00a0health body attributes the spike\u00a0to the arrival of\u00a0Anopheles stephensi, an invasive Asian mosquito species that transmit the deadly disease. The\u00a0mosquito species has also been detected in Ethiopia and Somalia, Djibouti\u2019s neighbors in the Horn of Africa, posing a significant regional threat. Unlike most malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in Africa that breed in rural areas, Anopheles Stephensi thrives in urban environments, intensifying the public health challenge for predominantly urban Djibouti. \u201cThis mosquito poses a huge threat to our fight against malaria,\u201d said Grey Frandsen, CEO of US-owned biotechnology firm Oxitec, which developed the gene-modified mosquitoes released in Djibouti. \u201cAnopheles\u00a0stephensi\u00a0evade conventional tools, are resistant to insecticides and daytime-biters, reducing the efficacy of bed nets,\u201d he said. Djibouti health minister Ahmed Robleh Abdilleh told CNN that his nation was trying out the new technology developed by Oxitec and believes it could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in reducing malaria spread. \u201cWe are in the pilot phase, but we believe in the technology. We are sure it will be the game changer,\u201d\u00a0Abdilleh\u00a0said. \u2018Using mosquitoes to fight mosquitoes\u2019 Dubbed a method that \u201cuses mosquitoes to fight mosquitoes\u201d, Oxitec\u2019s genetic technology targets female mosquitoes, which are predominantly responsible for malaria transmission. The technique involves releasing genetically engineered male mosquitoes into the wild, which then mate with females. The introduced gene prevents female offspring from surviving to adulthood, effectively reducing the population of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Male mosquitoes do not bite and therefore cannot transmit malaria. Frandsen said Oxitec\u2019s genetic technology, which is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has been effective in reducing other mosquito-borne viral diseases such as dengue fever in other parts of the world. \u201cOur technology is already proven to reduce populations of dengue-spreading Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes\u00a0by upwards of 95%\u00a0in urban communities in Brazil, and we are committed to delivering impact in urban communities in Djibouti and beyond,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe are still at the early stages of this program, but we\u2019re hopeful of the impact this can have in driving down malaria-spreading mosquitoes,\u201d he added. Although the rollout of genetically modified mosquitoes in Djibouti is only the second in Africa,\u00a0the idea is drawing more interest on the continent. In 2019, a team of scientists released Africa\u2019s pioneer batch of gene-modified mosquitoes to gather data on the potency of the technique in Burkina Faso where malaria is a leading cause of death. According to vector control research alliance, Target Malaria, the mosquitoes released in the west African country were\u00a0\u201cgenetically modified\u00a0to be sterile, so it can mate but cannot produce offspring.\u201d It added that an estimated 14,850 gene-modified male mosquitoes were released and 527 were recaptured. \u201cAfter recapturing them, the researchers found that the genetically modified mosquitoes were less mobile than their non-transgenic siblings and had lower survival rates,\u201d the alliance said of its findings, adding that a\u00a0second trial phase was being planned in the country. Uganda\u2019s President Yoweri Museveni announced in early January that his country is partnering with Oxitec to combat malaria. Africa bears the brunt of the global malaria burden, accounting for 96% of malaria deaths worldwide in 2021, according to the World Health Organization.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/africa/djibouti-releases-gene-modified-mosquitoes-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

During the two-day Rivers State Economic and Investment Summit (RSEIS), themed \u201cRivers Emerge: Advancing Pathways to Economic Growth and Sustainability,\u201d held at the Dr. Obi Wali International Conference Centre in Port Harcourt, Sanusi delivered a keynote address where he called for better management of the state\u2019s resources. \u201cWith rich abundant land, abundant resources, and natural resources, as well as the strategic location of the state, Rivers can be one of the best investors paradises, not just in Nigeria but in West Africa if the right things can be done,\u201d Sanusi said. The Emir of Kano stressed that a prosperous future relies on the capacity of state institutions and the quality and skills of its population. He drew comparisons with countries like Japan, Singapore, Germany, Australia, and Rwanda, which have thrived without significant natural resources, attributing their success to good governance, innovation, and education. Fubara highlighted the various measures taken to make Rivers State a destination for all categories of investors. \u201cWe have already implemented certain policy initiatives and reforms, including the prompt allocation and issuance of land titles and certificates of occupancy to prospective investors and a moratorium on State taxes and levies on new businesses. We are also working on the harmonization of state and local government taxes to eliminate double taxation and the imposition of multiple levies on investors,\u201d he said. Fubara also announced a N4 billion (over $2.7 million)\u00a0matching fund loan scheme with the Bank of Industry Limited for small, micro, and medium-scale businesses to drive financial inclusion and enhance the growth and development of these businesses. \u2018Oil is not a curse, the curse is the leaders\u2019 Sanusi pointed out that while countries like Russia, the UAE, and Norway have benefitted from their natural resources, their success also hinges on visionary governance and strong institutions. He argued that resources can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on leadership. \u201cOil is not a curse; the curse is the leaders we have had,\u201d he said. Fubara detailed further initiatives, including providing hundreds of hectares of land for projects like a multi-billion-naira aluminum rolling mill and collaborations with international firms to develop the state\u2019s agricultural potential. He emphasized the importance of reviving abandoned agricultural projects and infrastructure, saying he would set aside about $10 million for these efforts this fiscal year. Governor Fubara highlighted the investment opportunities across diverse sectors, including oil and gas, agriculture, manufacturing, hospitality, tourism, education, ICT, healthcare, infrastructure development, glass products, garments production, and power generation and transmission. With over 40% of fertile cultivable landmass, Rivers State has the potential to significantly contribute to national food security through commercial investments in mechanized agriculture and agro-processing industrial value chains, he said. In his keynote address, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu, said that due to the prevalence of poor governance in Nigeria, the abundant human and natural resources in the country have not been sufficiently harnessed to achieve the desired prosperity. He particularly advocated for the implementation of well-meaning policies to dismantle barriers to doing business while promoting transparency and building investor confidence. Moghalu added that, alongside developing requisite skills among the people and building enduring critical infrastructure, the foundation for good and competent governance should be assured to make the foreign direct investment (FDI) sought truly beneficial to the country. Sanusi concluded by highlighting the importance of investing in human capital and creating an education system that meets contemporary labor market demands. He called for an end to corruption in the judiciary, sensible tax policies, and the development of a skilled workforce to reduce dependence on foreign expertise. He urged Rivers State to aspire beyond being a recipient of federal allocations to becoming a commercial and industrial hub where citizens enjoy a decent standard of living.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/africa/nigerias-rivers-state-investor-magnet-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_trans-siberian-railway-romance-chance-encounters", "text": "Marie-Claire Martineau couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Elaine Comerford. It was late summer 1991. Marie-Claire was back in her home country of France after a couple of years working in Japan and a stint traveling across Europe by rail. Now Marie-Claire was 29 and felt listless \u2013 uncertain what the future held, uncertain where she might live, uncertain what she might do with her life. She played back her time with Elaine like a movie in her head. Those first moments together on the Trans-Siberian railway, speeding through Eastern Europe. Finding one another in Budapest. Sharing dreams and growing closer in Vienna. Now, Elaine was just a disembodied voice on the other end of a landline, a signature on a scrawled postcard with a Boston, Massachusetts, postmark. A couple of months passed. One day, Marie-Claire received a letter from Elaine explaining she was leaving her parents\u2019 home in Boston and moving to New York City. \u201cWhat are we?\u201d Elaine\u2019s letter read. \u201cWhat are we going to do? Are we going to continue this?\u201d All through their travels together Marie-Claire and Elaine lived in the moment, too busy enjoying the now to contemplate the future \u2013 especially when translating their vacation romance into the real world felt near impossible. Marie-Claire read and reread Elaine\u2019s words. It still felt impossible. On one of their grainy transatlantic phone calls, Elaine broached the topic directly \u2013 maybe Marie-Claire could come to the US? Maybe they could make a proper go of what they\u2019d started? Marie-Claire paused. Then she said no. Hanging up, she told herself once again that what she\u2019d shared with Elaine was \u201cjust a vacation romance.\u201d But that night, Marie-Claire couldn\u2019t sleep. \u201cI thought about it, and I missed her so much,\u201d Marie-Claire tells CNN Travel today. \u201cThe next day I bought my flight and I flew to New York to see her.\u201d First meeting Marie-Claire and Elaine\u2019s story first started on a bus in Beijing, China. The bus was ferrying travelers to the train station to board the Trans-Siberian railway. The Trans-Siberian railway spans 5,000 miles of track, comprising several routes including the Trans-Mongolian line, which winds from Beijing to Moscow via Mongolia. Marie-Claire and Elaine were among two dozen or so travelers who\u2019d signed up to the same organized tour \u201cstopping in Mongolia for a week and then taking the Trans-Siberian train all the way to Russia,\u201d as Marie-Claire recalls it. Elaine happened to board the bus first, with a gang of friends in tow. Like Marie-Claire, Elaine had been working in Japan for a while, teaching English. Then she\u2019d entered what she calls an \u201cin-between phase\u201d \u2013 traveling with friends from east Asia through Europe. \u201cYou know, young 20s, seeing a little bit of the world and enjoying some time with friends. That\u2019s where I was,\u201d Elaine tells CNN Travel today. Elaine and her friends were excitedly chatting on the bus when Elaine spotted Marie-Claire for the first time. She was instantly struck by this blonde stranger. \u201cMarie-Claire got on the bus and was walking down the middle, towards the back,\u201d Elaine recalls. \u201cI thought, \u2018Hmm, okay. This is somebody I might want to speak to.\u201d Marie-Claire was also traveling with a friend \u2013 kind of. \u201cShe was an ex-girlfriend, actually, although at that point it was platonic,\u201d Marie-Claire explains. Flirting in Mongolia As the travelers decamped the bus and boarded the train, introductions were made. Elaine and Marie-Claire spoke to one another for the first time. \u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly what the first conversations were,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cJust probably \u2018getting to know you\u2019 comments \u2013 \u2018Where are you coming from?\u2019 \u2013 And I\u2019m sure we talked about Japan at some point, because we\u2019d both lived in Japan.\u201d On board the train, the entire tour party stuck together \u201cgetting to know each other, hanging out, playing some cards,\u201d as Elaine recalls. Once the group arrived in Mongolia, they were split in two. Elaine maneuvered herself to make sure she ended up in Marie-Claire\u2019s half. Then over that week exploring Mongolia, Marie-Claire and Elaine grew closer. The polite pleasantries on the train somehow seamlessly switched to in-jokes, laughter and constantly gravitating to one another\u2019s side. \u201cWe started flirting,\u201d says Marie-Claire. Back on the train, over the several days traveling from Mongolia to Russia, the spark between Marie-Claire and Elaine became impossible to ignore. \u201cWe were on the train, going through Siberia when we first kissed,\u201d says Elaine. Elaine was sharing a train car with two of her friends. They were in the bottom bunk, asleep, while Elaine was in the top, restless. \u201cThen Marie came to my bunk,\u201d Elaine recalls. \u201cWe kissed,\u201d says Marie-Claire. They both knew \u201cit was heading that way,\u201d as Elaine puts it. And from there, Marie-Claire and Elaine were pretty inseparable. They stole moments together whenever they could \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t always easy to do so. \u201cYou\u2019re on a train with a lot of people,\u201d Marie-Claire recalls. \u201cSo to find a moment alone was very hard \u2013 it was literally six days on a train.\u201d Still, falling for each other as the train sped through the Siberian countryside was exciting. \u201cThe train was fun,\u201d says Elaine. Each time the train pulled up at a station, the travelers would lean out the windows and purchase food and drink from local sellers. At one station, Elaine and one of her friends got off to buy something. Then the train unexpectedly started to leave the station. \u201cSo the train started pulling away,\u201d recalls Elaine. \u201cAnd me and my friend Steve were running for the train and jumped on, we made it.\u201d When the train arrived in Moscow, locals met the travelers at the station, offering rooms for accommodation. It was an \u201cold-school version of Airbnb,\u201d says Marie-Claire. Elaine, Marie-Claire and their friends all opted for the same accommodation \u2013 a tiny apartment where the host squeezed in eight mattresses on the floor. Marie-Claire and Elaine took mattresses next to each other. \u201cWe lay next to each other,\u201d says Marie-Claire. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got a room full of mattresses, you can\u2019t do much.\u201d But in the night, Marie-Claire and Elaine reached out across the dusty floor to hold hands. By then, the two knew \u201cwe had this romance that was budding,\u201d says Elaine. But Marie-Claire and Elaine didn\u2019t tell anyone else about their feelings for one another. \u201cWe\u2019d all have dinner at a restaurant and we would meet in the bathroom to kiss,\u201d recalls Marie-Claire. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was so obvious,\u201d says Elaine, laughing at the memory. They kept their connection on the down low in part because Marie-Claire was traveling with her ex-girlfriend. And it was 1991 \u2013 It was \u201ca different time back then,\u201d as Elaine puts it. \u201cSame sex relationships weren\u2019t as accepted,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friends wouldn\u2019t have cared. But at that point, it was still a big thing to come out to people.\u201d Back home in the US Elaine was only out to \u201cclose friends.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody in my family knew at that point,\u201d she says. Marie-Claire also wasn\u2019t open about her sexuality at that time. \u201cNobody knew I was gay,\u201d she says. Next travels After the organized tour concluded in Moscow, the travelers were left to their own devices. Some went home. Meanwhile, Elaine and her friend Diane headed to Germany, and then visited Turkey and Greece. Marie-Claire briefly returned to France, then reunited with Elaine and Diane in Budapest, Hungary. By then, Elaine had told Diane about her relationship with Marie-Claire. \u201cDiane knew at this point,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cSo we traveled a bit together. And then Diane went back home. And Marie-Claire and I went on to Vienna.\u201d In Austria, Marie-Claire and Elaine were alone together for the first time. It was thrilling and terrifying. \u201cIt was the first time that we were going to be just the two of us,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cIt was exciting to be able to finally have some time to ourselves. But we were also nervous.\u201d In Vienna, Marie-Claire and Elaine grew even closer. They both felt like they were falling for each other. But there was no long-term plan. \u201cIt was very much in the moment,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cYou know, \u2018Let\u2019s meet up and have fun and travel around.\u2019\u201d So Elaine returned to the US, and Marie-Claire to France. That\u2019s when the period of letter-writing and grainy phone calls started. And then came Marie-Claire\u2019s spontaneous decision to travel to New York and find Elaine. She booked her flight, a piece of paper with Elaine\u2019s Queens address in her pocket. Elaine told Marie-Claire to meet her in Manhattan, where she was now working. But when she landed Marie-Claire struggled to figure out how to phone Elaine, unfamiliar with the US area code system. She ended up deciding to travel to the Queens address in the hope she\u2019d find Elaine waiting there. Meanwhile, Elaine wondered what had happened. \u201cThree hours later, she ended up at the door,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cShe had somehow managed to get from the airport to Midtown, and then managed to get on the train and find this address in Queens.\u201d In a pre-Google-Maps age, this was pretty impressive. \u201cAnd so I moved in with Elaine. I just stayed,\u201d says Marie-Claire. She\u2019d brought next to nothing with her, but Marie-Claire was used to living out of a backpack. \u201cJust as long as I have enough underwear and bras,\u201d she says. From there, Marie-Claire and Elaine settled in a New York routine together. They loved living together. And as time went on \u2013 as Marie-Claire tried to work out a way to stay in the US\u00a0permanently \u2013 the couple started working together too. They ended up starting a vacation rental company together. In time, Marie-Claire got a real estate license and a work visa. When Marie-Claire rang her parents in France and told them she had no plans to return, they didn\u2019t try and convince her otherwise. Marie-Claire\u2019s German mother and French father met abroad, and they\u2019d always encouraged Marie-Claire to travel the world and embrace adventure. But Marie-Claire still wasn\u2019t comfortable telling her parents that she was staying in New York because she\u2019d fallen in love for a woman, although over time her parents realized the two were together. As for Elaine, she decided when Marie-Claire moved in that she would tell her parents they were together. She also shared the news with her extended network of New York friends. \u201cSoon she met a lot of my friends in the city, and at some point met my family,\u201d recalls Elaine. The friends who\u2019d traveled on the Trans-Siberian railway with Elaine and Marie-Claire were especially delighted for them \u2013 and admitted that they\u2019d suspected what was going on the whole time. A life together Over the next several years, Marie Claire and Elaine\u2019s real estate business grew, becoming a company called Maison Internationale. Working together came easily to the couple. \u201cEven at the end of the day, even if we\u2019d been in the office together, we\u2019d still have something to talk about at the end of the day, because she would do different things than I do,\u201d says Marie-Claire. Elaine and Marie-Claire were content with their life together. They \u201cnever thought about getting married,\u201d says Elaine. It was off the cards. And for similar reasons, Marie-Claire and Elaine didn\u2019t think they\u2019d ever have a child together. But as time moved on, society started to shift. Adopting a child as a same-sex couple became a possibility. In the summer of 2006, Elaine and Marie-Claire were on vacation together in Provincetown, Massachusetts, celebrating 15 years since they first met. \u201cAnd we got the call on our anniversary that a baby boy was born, and that the mother had chosen us,\u201d says Marie-Claire. \u201cWe drove the next morning to meet him.\u201d Marie-Claire and Elaine welcomed their son, Marcello, that year. They loved becoming parents and committed to passing on a love of travel to Marcello, taking him to a different destination every year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to Thailand together. We\u2019ve been to Vietnam, we\u2019ve been to Colombia, Ecuador, down to the Galapagos, to Europe and across the United States,\u201d says Elaine. In 2015, when gay marriage became legal across all US states Marie-Claire and Elaine decided to get married. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a priority for us,\u201d says Elaine, of marriage. \u201cAnd then once it became federal, I think things changed. It was like, \u2018Oh, we can get married. So we decided to.\u2019\u201d The wedding took place on Anna Maria Island, Florida, on a glorious sandy beach, with some 70 guests in attendance. \u201cIt was fun and emotional, but mostly fun,\u201d says Elaine. Over the course of the wedding celebrations there were several nods to Marie-Claire and Elaine\u2019s origin story. Each table had a little train car as the centerpiece. At the reception, one of the friends who was on the train with Marie-Claire and Elaine when they met wrote a poem about their romance. \u201cThat was special,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cIt all kind of tied it back.\u201d The wedding day poem is framed and hangs on Elaine and Marie-Claire\u2019s wall to this day. \u2018An adventure of the heart\u2019 Today, Elaine and Marie-Claire split their time between New York and Florida. Their son is now 18 and recently graduated high school. The family still love traveling together. It\u2019s 32 years since Elaine and Marie-Claire shared the kiss on the train that kickstarted their romance. \u201cI believe it was meant to be,\u201d says Marie-Cliare. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer of past lives and that chance encounters happen. We most probably knew each other in our past life. And we found each other again.\u201d As for Elaine, she thinks their story began with a \u201ctravel adventure\u201d but it was also \u201can adventure of the heart\u201d \u2013 an adventure that\u2019s continued over the past three decades. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I take for granted,\u201d says Elaine of their years of happiness. Elaine, Marie-Claire and their son Marcello have a family motto, based around their shared initials, EMC. The motto is \u201cEvery moment counts.\u201d That mantra is interwoven into their love story, says Elaine. \u201cOur story has evolved over the years from when we first met and to where we are now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not taking that for granted. And remembering all of the different pieces of your life, and your times together that make you who you are today, as both individuals and as a couple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/trans-siberian-railway-romance-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_world_habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Two teams of scientists have discovered a theoretically habitable planet, smaller than Earth but bigger than Venus, orbiting a small star about 40 light-years away. The exoplanet, named Gliese 12b, orbits a cool red dwarf star situated in the constellation Pisces and is about 27% the size of our sun and 60% of its temperature, according to the two studies published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Since its star is so much smaller than the sun, Gliese 12b still falls within the habitable zone \u2014 the ideal distance away from a star where liquid water can exist \u2014 even though it completes its orbit every 12.8 days. Working on the assumption that the exoplanet doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, scientists calculated its surface temperature to be around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). \u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo and co-leader of one of the research teams with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo, in a statement. Once temperate Earth-size planets have been identified, scientists can then analyze them to determine which elements are contained in their atmospheres and, crucially, whether water is present to sustain life. \u201cThere\u2019s only a handful (of exoplanets) we\u2019ve found that are good candidates for that. And this is our nearest and so that\u2019s quite a major discovery,\u201d Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London who co-led the other study, told CNN on Friday. Understanding Gliese 12b To spot Gliese 12b, scientists used the publicly available data collected by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \u2014 a telescope that stares at tens of thousands of stars every month, tracking their changes in brightness, which can be evidence of orbiting exoplanets. It is easier for astronomers to find exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars since their relatively small size results in a greater dimming effect during each transit. At the moment, scientists are unsure exactly what constitutes this planet\u2019s atmosphere, whether it even has one and if water is present, though Palethorpe said they aren\u2019t expecting to find water there. \u201cThere could be no water, and then we know a runaway greenhouse effect has already happened on this planet and it\u2019s more like Venus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be water, in which case it\u2019s more like us\u2026 or there are signatures that can be detectable that would be able to show you that the runaway greenhouse effect is in progress so it could be losing water.\u201d For the next stage of analyzing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope and conduct spectroscopy analysis. This method involves capturing starlight that shines through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere and seeing which wavelengths are absorbed by certain molecules, revealing their presence in the atmosphere. As well as shedding light on the exoplanet itself, Palethorpe said scientists are hoping that this work can help us understand our own planet better. \u201cWhat this planet will teach us in particular is what happened for Earth to stay habitable but for Venus to not\u2026 It can tell us the habitability patheways that planets take as they develop,\u201d she said. But though the exoplanet could potentially be habitable for humans and is relatively \u201cnear\u201d our solar system in astronomical terms, it is unlikely that anyone will visit there soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not reachable, it\u2019s 12 parsecs away,\u201d said Palethorpe, adding that it would take about 225,000 years to reach Gliese 12b with the fastest spacecraft that currently exist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_americas_haiti-gang-mss-kenya-explainer-intl", "text": "After months of planning and discussion, the deployment of an international force to violence-wracked Haiti has been delayed again, puncturing hopes that a vanguard of Kenyan police would arrive this week. High-profile meetings on Thursday hinted at once-high expectations. In the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, the country\u2019s governing Transitional Presidential Council posted photos of its meeting with a Kenyan delegation. In Washington, US President Joe Biden and Kenyan President William Ruto touted their nations\u2019 collaboration on the mission (largely equipped by the US) at a joint press conference. Peace and security in Haiti are the \u201ccollective responsibility of all nations,\u201d Ruto said, warning that Kenya will \u201ctake that responsibility along with the Haitian police\u201d and \u201cbreak the backs of gangs and criminals.\u201d But for now, armed groups continue to rampage in capital city Port-au-Prince, extorting residents and controlling the movement of vital fuel, food and medical supplies. On Thursday evening, a young US missionary couple were attacked by gangs at a church in the city and later killed, their family said. Who are Haiti\u2019s gangs? Originally created as enforcers for Haiti\u2019s political and business elite, Haiti\u2019s rival gangs have in recent months formed a broad coalition known as \u201cViv Ansamn,\u201d or \u201cLive together,\u201d and are now coordinating attacks on government institutions like police stations and prisons. Haiti\u2019s National Police have been battling the gangs block by block, but they are understaffed and under-equipped. Since the assassination of then-President Jovenel Moise in 2021, the gangs\u2019 grip has expanded from an estimated 50% of the city to 80% today. Law enforcement sources in Haiti now liken the urban battlefield to quicksand, telling CNN that they need reinforcements to hold and defend territory. Complicating the situation is a torrent of smuggled guns and ammunition arming Haiti\u2019s gangs, despite an arms embargo on the island. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended US backing for the international mission, warning a Senate Foreign Relations hearing that without foreign support, Haiti is \u201con the precipice of becoming an all-out failed state.\u201d What is the Multinational Security Support mission? Haiti\u2019s government has been asking for international military assistance since 2022. In October last year, the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) was finally greenlit by the United Nations\u2019 powerful Security Council. Designed to coordinate closely with Haiti\u2019s National Police, the MSS is expected to focus on securing the city\u2019s airport, seaport and key roads, according to people with knowledge of the mission\u2019s planning. Kenya, which volunteered to lead the mission, has committed 1,000 police officers. Most of those are Kenyan border police, chosen for their experience in dealing with armed non-state actors such as Al Shabaab and in operating in foreign contexts such as Somalia, Sudan and Congo, according to Bill O\u2019Neill, the UN expert on human rights in Haiti. According to documents seen by CNN, the mission will be helmed by a Kenyan police commissioner and a Jamaican police lieutenant, with other top posts filled by Kenyan staff. The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica have also promised to contribute personnel to the mission. Although the MSS was approved more than seven months ago, it has been mired in complications, including court challenges in Kenya and political tumult in Haiti. In March, a surge of gang violence forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign shortly after inking a deal with Kenya for the mission; Ruto\u2019s administration has since found a new partner in Haiti\u2019s Transitional Presidential Council, established last month. During the Thursday press conference, journalist Ayub Abdikadir from Kenya\u2019s Citizen TV questioned Ruto on the strategy of sending forces to a crisis in the distant Caribbean while security problems endure in Kenya\u2019s North Rift region. \u201cWhy are you committing to Kenya when we have a problem back home?\u201d he asked. Kenya\u2019s responsibility is broader than its own borders, Ruto responded, underlining that troops and police had already been deployed to \u201csort out the banditry problem\u201d in the North Rift. A UN-managed trust fund for the mission currently contains $21 million, provided by Canada ($8.7 million), the United States ($6 million), France ($3.2 million) and Spain ($3 million), according to the UN. The US and Canada have also committed more, much of it expected to take the form of equipment and other resources. Why hasn\u2019t the MSS begun yet? (A shortage of medevac helicopters, in part) May 23 had been the working deadline for a first instalment of 200 Kenyan police officers to arrive, according to documents seen by CNN. Several dozen Jamaican officers were expected to arrive in Haiti by mid-June, with more trickling in through the summer. This week, a Kenyan team including several police commanders visited Port-au-Prince to assess whether facilities were ready to accommodate a deployment. A base for the MSS near Toussaint Louverture airport in Port-au-Prince is close to completion \u2013 boasting a medical facility and a trauma surgeon already on site \u2013 but the Kenyan delegation concluded that some equipment was insufficient. They were particularly concerned by a lack of helicopters for medical evacuations, multiple sources said, citing confusion over which nation would provide them. Kenyan authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Documents seen by CNN show that El Salvador had been floated as a potential provider of medevac helicopters, which Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa played down as unlikely in comments to CNN. \u201cWe would like to be part of the solution, but we would need a mandate clearly from the United Nations and the acceptance of the host country,\u201d he said, adding that El Salvador could potentially offer its highly trained helicopter pilots and experts to oversee air operations for the MSS if called upon. More equipment, including armored vehicles and radios, is expected to arrive in Haiti for the MSS over the coming days and weeks. What now? Experts on the ground say the Haitian government also has more work to do to lay the groundwork for the mission, particularly in communicating with the public \u2013 and even the gangs \u2013 about how it will work. One source with experience in dealing with Haiti\u2019s gangs said the Transitional Presidential Council should be developing messaging to the gangs themselves about potential \u201coff-ramps\u201d from outright confrontation with the MSS, potentially by turning themselves in or otherwise seeking nonviolent resolution. Haitian police union SPNH17 meanwhile told CNN that plans for their collaboration with the international mission were too opaque and questioned why there wasn\u2019t more focus on providing material support to the local police. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the international community working with a few sectors with no clear plans on what they\u2019ll do and how. We don\u2019t even know how we will communicate with the Kenyan police officers who speaks English. We speak French and Creole in Haiti,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cWe believe only the Haitian police can provide long term security for Haiti. What we need are materials and logistical support.\u201d Haitian anti-corruption group Nou Pap D\u00f2mi (NPD) echoed the concern about transparency, noting that there needs to be clear mechanisms of accountability for the foreign forces\u2019 conduct in Haiti. \u201cWhile NPD believes that international support is necessary to address the crisis, we have always advocated for an approach that focuses primarily on strengthening the Haitian National Police so that it can address these challenges with lasting effect,\u201d the group said in a statement to CNN. Amid the continuing uncertainty this week about when the MSS will come, NPD said: \u201cThe Kenyan mission remains a mystery to the Haitian people; no one knows what it entails and there has been no communication on the matter, despite the arrival of several US military planes in Haiti.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/americas/haiti-gang-mss-kenya-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc", "text": "It\u2019s early morning in Sera Community Conservancy in Northern Kenya and sunlight beats down across this expansive semi-arid landscape. Birds calling and boots crunching are the only sounds for miles as a team led by Kenyan wildlife veterinarian Dr. Mukami Ruoro-Oundo carefully tracks white rhinos \u2014 the first of their kind to be found here in Samburu County. Once common in the area, by the early 1990s Northern Kenya\u2019s rhino population was decimated by poaching. But the country\u2019s black rhino population has more than doubled since 1989, and by December 2022 there were 1,900 black rhinos and white rhinos in total, according to Kenya Wildlife Services. Sera Conservancy has championed the country\u2019s community-led rhino conservation efforts. In 2015 it established East Africa\u2019s first community rhino sanctuary with the introduction of 10 critically endangered black rhinos. Today, that number has grown to 21 black rhinos which freely roam across 107 square kilometers (41 square miles) of designated sanctuary land, and in February 2024, they were joined by four white rhinos from the nearby Lewa Conservancy. As she searches on foot, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo spots two of the female white rhinos. One, called Sarah, looks heavily pregnant but as the vet creeps closer she notices something is very wrong. Mindful of not encroaching too long on the rhinos\u2019 territory and reluctant to intervene unnecessarily, she opts for a different approach; through a conservation technology tool called EarthRanger she can monitor Sarah\u2019s movements in real time from a distance.\u00a0 Prior to translocation, each of the four white rhinos was fitted with a GPS tag in its horns and ears, which sends a real-time location to remote devices like mobile phones, or to the conservancy\u2019s operations center, where Dr. Ruoro-Oundo is able to monitor Sarah\u2019s location and movements. As EarthRanger\u2019s co-founder Jake Wall tells CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like a \u2018Find my Friends\u2019 for rhino.\u201d Sparse internet connectivity means Dr. Ruoro-Oundo cannot get a clear signal from Sarah\u2019s transmitter but thankfully Sarah is not alone; a female rhino named Arot has never left her side and through Arot\u2019s transmitter Dr. Ruoro-Oundo can see that Sarah has barely moved in hours, suggesting her condition is deteriorating. By using a drone to take photos of her, the team is able to confirm that Sarah urgently needs help. \u201cWe noticed she has a fecal impaction, it was quite huge and had made the rectal and vulvar area swollen,\u201d says Dr. Ruoro-Oundo. \u201cShe\u2019s in a lot of pain because she could not put down her tail, and you could see she was a bit sluggish, she really wanted to spend her time lying down. So in such a case we really need to intervene for her comfort, to relieve her of the distress and the pain.\u201d An emergency intervention is immediately put into action, led by Kenya Wildlife Services and Sera Conservancy\u2019s management and rangers. Air, ground and additional veterinary support are mobilized within hours \u2014 potentially saving not only Sarah\u2019s life but that of her unborn calf too. For Dr. Ruoro-Oundo, the key to safeguarding Kenya\u2019s wildlife is a balance between community and technology. \u201cI think you cannot separate technology from conservation in the future,\u201d she says.\u201d The human element can never be removed, but technology will always come to assist where we cannot reach.\u201d A global effort Now used in 70 countries, EarthRanger\u2019s story started in Kenya when co-founder Wall was researching elephants there. \u201cIn about 2012, we had a real crisis with poaching in Kenya, so we wanted a way that we could pick up on elephants that were getting killed, and the sign for us was that the collar stopped moving for more than about five or six hours, which is the longest sort of period that an elephant rests for,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I wrote the algorithm that could work out whether an elephant had stopped moving or not, and then (the collar) would send an SMS if it had. So that was kind of the beginning.\u201d He adds that the system has evolved quite significantly since then, and Sarah is one of 9,000 animals \u2014 including elephants, lions, giraffe, tortoises, sea turtles and 1,200 rhinos \u2014 that EarthRanger is currently tracking in Kenya alone. Wall says the system can integrate data from more than 100 different devices \u2014 \u201canything from elephant trackers to ear tags for rhino, to collars for lions, tail tags (for giraffes), devices that glue onto the shell of a turtle.\u201d It can also receive information from sources such as vehicle trackers, satellites, and remote sensing alerts for things like deforestation and fire. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling it all into one platform, where it can be readily visualized, analyzed and then acted upon,\u201d Wall adds. \u201cAnd all of that\u2019s giving the operators and managers a bird\u2019s eye view of the situation as it\u2019s happening, with real-time tools.\u201d According to the EarthRanger, all of these devices are designed to be lightweight, durable and inconspicuous ensuring they don\u2019t impact on the animals\u2019 natural behavior or cause them discomfort. For rhinos, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo says that attaching a tracker is the equivalent sensation of a human getting their ears pierced. Samuel Lekimaroro, a wildlife protection manager for the Northern Rangelands Trust, which includes Sera Conservancy, uses this kind of data to live-track terrestrial and marine wildlife across 6.5 million hectares. For Lekimaroro it has become a powerful tool in translocating wildlife, data collection and security operations, including identifying hotspots for human-wildlife conflict. \u201cThanks to EarthRanger, trophy poaching has been on a steady decline for the last five years, from a high of 120 elephants poached in 2012, to zero in the last four years in (our) member conservancies,\u201d he says. Wall says its potential to securely collect and share data from different EarthRanger sites from across the world is revolutionary. \u201cIf organizations are doing, say, joint patrolling, or monitoring of a species, then they can also share that information,\u201d he says. \u201cBy storing information on EarthRanger we can pull that data from different sites and combine it in ways that was never possible before. So it\u2019s really enabling the analysis and the reporting in a way that just never existed before.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_europe_depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam", "text": "In a scene reminiscent of La Dolce Vita era, French actor Gerard Depardieu has been accused of attacking celebrity photographer Rino Barillari outside Harry\u2019s Bar on the famed Via Veneto in Rome. Depardieu was dining at an outdoor table with a female companion and two other people around 2 p.m. local time on Tuesday when Barillari \u2013 known as \u201cthe king\u201d in Roman press circles \u2013 apparently snapped the diners, according to Italian media reports. Exactly what happened next is a matter of dispute, though both sides say they have filed police reports known locally as denouncements. Barillari, age 79, said Depardieu\u2019s partner Magda Vavrusova jumped up and started punching him before Depardieu joined the fight, according to Barillari\u2019s lawyer, as cited in several Italian media outlets including the Messaggero newspaper where Barillari works. Police confirmed to CNN that \u201ca local photographer\u201d had filed a complaint around an incident at Harry\u2019s Bar on Tuesday, but did not divulge the names of those involved. Piero Lepore, the owner of Harry\u2019s Bar in Rome, confirmed to CNN that the incident happened, but did not cast blame. Barillari often captures celebrities dining at the establishment, which is famous for appearing in the 1960 Federico Fellini film \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d \u2013 whose photographer character Paparazzo is reputed to have inspired the term \u201cpaparazzi.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen fisticuffs here in two decades. This sort of thing never happens here,\u201d Lepore told CNN by telephone. \u201cWe are used to celebrities and we are used to paparazzi \u2013 they can\u2019t survive without each other. But we are no longer used to these fights.\u201d When asked for details, he said that because there was now a denouncement by Barillari, he could not comment. \u201cI gave my testimony to the police. I can\u2019t say any more.\u201d Barillari was taken to hospital by ambulance, according to Lepore. Magda Vavrusova\u2019s lawyer, Delphine Meillet,\u00a0said in a statement to CNN that it was Barillari who had pushed Vavrusova. Meillet told the Adnkronos news agency that Vavrusova filed a denouncement with Rome police stating: \u201cThe photographer pushed me, touching my torso and chest with his arm. At this moment in which I present the complaint I still feel pain, it was very violent.\u201d Meillet told the news agency that Vavrusova was also in the hospital, though calls to the University Policlinico Umberto did not confirm her as a patient. Meillet also told the news outlet that in fact Depardieu had run to intervene after the photographer attacked his companion and \u201cslipped and fell on him.\u201d CNN has also reached out to Depardieu\u2019s lawyer for comment. A spokesperson for Rome police said they are currently looking for surveillance footage from the area. Barillari got his start as a celebrity paparazzi when he was just 16 years old by delivering photos he had taken of celebrities at the Trevi Fountain to various news outlets, according to his biography. He has been to the emergency room 200 times after being attacked by his subjects, he said in a documentary to mark his 70th birthday nine years ago. He went on to become Rome\u2019s most infamous paparazzi, publishing several books of his images which have included popes, presidents and stars like Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Liz Taylor and Frank Sinatra, according to his bio. He has suffered 82 broken cameras, 11 broken ribs and a broken femur after photographing a local celebrity allegedly beating up his girlfriend in Piazza Navona, where he lives and keeps a photo studio. Depardieu\u2019s run-in with Barillari comes after the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office told CNN last month that the French actor \u2013 known for his roles in films like \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Man in the Iron Mask\u201d and \u201cLife of Pi\u201d \u2013 would face trial in October over allegations of sexual assault said to have taken place during the shooting of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d in 2021. The actor is also being formally investigated on suspicion of rape and sexual assault allegedly committed in August 2018 against actress Charlotte Arnould, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. The French actor has denied all the rape and sexual assault  accusations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

The supermodel, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, drew praise from some on social media after she was pictured walking on the promenade in a dress by design duo Michael and Hushi. \u201cOur Palestinian princess,\u201d\u00a0wrote one user on X.\u00a0\u201cLoving this homage to her Palestinian roots,\u201d praised a separate user on Instagram, while another comment read, \u201cThis is fashion with purpose.\u201d The supermodel later reposted a picture of the dress with the caption \u201cFree Palestine forever\u201d in her stories on Instagram, where she is frequently vocal about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza. In October last year, she wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: \u201cMy heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,\u201d referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. And on May 15, Hadid marked Nakba Day (commemorating the time in 1948 when an estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes)\u00a0with a post\u00a0sharing her family\u2019s history as Nakba survivors and pleading for an end to the war in Gaza. \u201cPlease look into the eyes of the Palestinians suffering,\u201d she wrote. The keffiyeh scarf, on which Hadid\u2019s dress is based, is worn across the Middle East. But in recent decades, it\u00a0has come to be identified as a symbol of Palestinian identity and resistance. Hadid\u2019s dress is from the archives of\u00a0Michael and Hushi, a New York-based brand founded by Michael Sears and Hushidar Mortezaie. The dress retailed for $900 in September 2001 and was featured in magazines including Women\u2019s Wear Daily and Wallpaper, according to an Instagram post by Mortezaie.  Some on social media were quick to point out that Hadid\u2019s dress was not technically a Palestinian\u00a0keffiyeh, with the colors more closely resembling those used in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Mortezaie, one of the original designers, explained the intentions behind the dress. \u201cThis dress was made 23 years ago and everyone from the region was grouped as one big Other. There was no Google. Only what could be put together with little resources. Hopefully we can all learn to stand in unity and love against genocide,\u201d\u00a0he wrote on Instagram.

{"id": "2024_05_25_sport_manchester-united-manchester-city-fa-cup-spt-intl", "text": "Manchester United won the FA Cup on Saturday, defying the odds to defeat overwhelming favorite Manchester City 2-1 and deny its crosstown rival back-to-back league and cup doubles. A week is a long time in soccer. On Sunday, Manchester City sealed a historic fourth consecutive Premier League title and was ready to cap a glittering season with another trophy at Wembley. Pre-match there was a sense of inevitability about the result \u2013 United had lost six of its last seven matches against City and four of its last five finals, while City was enjoying another dominant season. But United scored two first-half goals in quick succession \u2013 the first from Alejandro Garnacho, the second from Kobbie Mainoo \u2013 to rattle the Premier League champion and make this the first men\u2019s FA Cup final, according to statisticians Opta, with two teenage goalscorers. City continued to press in the second half, creating several opportunities that only brilliant goalkeeping from Andr\u00e9 Onana or the woodwork could keep out, before Jeremy Doku scored in the 87th minute, halving United\u2019s lead and setting up a frantic seven minutes of stoppage time. But United clung on to its hard-fought lead and its bench emptied onto the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate winning a trophy after an often miserable season for the historic club. Their celebrations continued as Prince William, the President of the Football Association, handed them the trophy with Prince George alongside him, watching on. \u201cIt was the last chance to get something positive from the season,\u201d captain Bruno Fernandes told the BBC afterwards. \u201cWe were here last season and we weren\u2019t good enough and we had to see them go up and get the trophy.\u201d \u201cIt is crucial for everyone. We know the manager is under so much scrutiny, he deserves this, also everyone in the backroom staff and the players, we all deserve this.\u201d A manager under pressure Rumors and reports swirled before kickoff about the fate of United manager Erik ten Hag and whether he would lose his job regardless of the FA Cup final result. After two years in the job, and a promising start, the Dutchman has so far failed to turn around United\u2019s dwindling fortunes and led the club to an eighth place finish in the Premier League this season, its lowest ever. Such a backdrop to the final echoed the one in 2016, when one of Ten Hag\u2019s predecessors, Louis van Gaal, was sacked just after he won the FA Cup final. It has been eight years since then, 11 since legendary manager Alex Ferguson retired, and still United has not rediscovered the winning formula that made it the Premier League\u2019s most dominant club in the 1990s and 2000s. Instead, it has become mired in a seemingly endless cycle of hiring and firing managers once every couple of years, a cycle that Ten Hag looks to be in danger of repeating, even after this extraordinary shock result. He cut a tense figure on the touchline, watching City dominate possession in the early exchanges, employing its usual method of wearing the opposition down through sheer force, but, this time, it could not break down the United defense. Instead, it was United who took the early lead, capitalizing on a rare City mistake when a miscommunication between Josko Gvardiol and Stefan Ortega caused Gvardiol to head the ball over his goalkeeper, leaving Garnacho a clear path to tap the ball into the net. Seven minutes later, United thought it had doubled its lead through Marcus Rashford though he was offside and the goal was disallowed, but that was no matter. It took just two more minutes for United to find the back of the net once again. Rashford floated the ball downfield from just beyond the halfway line and found Garnacho on the other wing who passed inside to Fernandes in the center of the box.The United captain delicately tapped the ball to Mainoo who made no mistake with the finish to give his side a 2-0 lead at halftime. City seemed stunned and never quite settled into its usual rhythm. Erling Haaland had an opportunity but struck the woodwork and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez pulled a shot wide of the goal before Doku scored. But it was too little too late and City succumbed to a rare defeat, bringing the curtain down on another dominant, historic season, though this one finished with one trophy, instead of the three it won last year.

{"id": "2024_05_23_middleeast_raisi-funeral-analysis-intl", "text": "From his days as a clerical student, to overseeing executions as part of the judiciary, Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s life has been intimately tied with Iran\u2019s tumultuous modern history. Yet after all that, his presidency was notably unremarkable. Unlike previous Iranian presidents, Raisi seemed content to serve as an empty vessel that carried out the reactionary policies of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,\u00a0the final arbiter on policymaking. He showed none of the subtle pushback of his predecessor, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani. He also lacked the charisma of conservative former presidents who were happy to do Khamenei\u2019s bidding\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as the firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but who sought to carve out autonomy for the position of the presidency. So, when foreign dignitaries from a whopping 68 countries gathered for Raisi\u2019s funeral on Thursday, they may not have been preoccupied with thoughts of the late president. This was not a game-changing death like the 2020 assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the military mastermind credited with creating a strategic stranglehold over much of the Middle East and helping to put the US on the backfoot. Raisi\u2019s absence, in contrast, is unlikely to be felt. Yet his untimely death could hardly have come at a more pivotal time for Iran. \u201cForeign dignitaries will be trying to get a read of the country,\u201d Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute Trita Parsi told CNN. \u201cThis is also an opportunity for many of them to manifest how their relationship with Iran has changed.\u201d Iran is deeply enmeshed in the war in Gaza, with Tehran-back armed groups engaged in a low rumbling tit for tat with Israel and its allies across four different countries. In April, it launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel from its territory after an apparent Israeli airstrike on Tehran\u2019s consulate in Damascus. In this fraught moment for the region, leaders from Turkey to India and China \u2013 many of which declared days of national mourning for the late president \u2013 appear keen not to ruffle feathers. The deaths also come after years of diplomatic efforts to achieve a rapprochement with former regional nemeses, such as\u00a0Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,\u00a0both of which were represented at the funeral. Qatar\u2019s emir, as well the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait attended the funeral. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who the International Criminal Court is seeking an arrest warrant for alongside Israeli leaders, was also in attendance. Tens of thousands flocked to the streets to mark the funeral, throwing flowers at the coffins. It was a strong show of support for the regime, and a demonstration of its powerbase. Iran\u2019s populace is deeply polarized, but the regime showed that it could still mobilize a critical mass. Iran today seems not to be the pariah state that former US President Donald Trump almost turned it into in 2018 when he pulled out of a landmark Obama-era nuclear deal that exchanged sanctions relief for curbs to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThis (funeral) is a way for countries to show the progress they have made in repairing relations with Iran,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cWe have missed how Iran\u2019s relations in the region have gone through a significant transformation.\u201d Foreign dignitaries are likely engaged in sideline chats to try to get a read on Khamenei\u2019s opaque and sometimes unpredictable thinking on domestic policy\u00a0that could have repercussions for the region. Constitutionally, a presidential election must be held within 50 days of the demise of a sitting president. That is a relatively short time to prepare for a race charged with consequence for Iran\u2019s theocratic leadership. The election will have ramifications for the question of the succession plans of the ailing 85-year-old Khamenei, who is only the second Supreme Leader to rule the Islamic Republic. Moreover, the race can\u00a0either appease or, conversely, fuel the tensions brought on by\u00a0the\u00a0youth-led\u00a0nationwide uprising that rocked the country less than two years ago. Khamenei has ultimate sway over elections through the country\u2019s Guardian Council, which consists of jurists appointed by the Supreme Leader, and which is tasked with vetting election candidates. In the 2021 presidential election, the council disqualified most viable candidates besides Raisi, paving a clear path to his presidency. The race was widely seen as heavily engineered and produced a record low voter turnout. The leader may orchestrate a repeat of that race. He could also decide to change tack, opening it up so that Iran\u2019s next president enjoys broad popular support. \u201cThe election can be a watershed moment for Iran,\u201d Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of\u00a0Amwaj.media,\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201c(Khamenei) has a golden opportunity to reverse course in a face-saving way, make a U-turn, open up the space and allow people to run.\u201d During his tenure, Raisi made only feeble attempts to dispel the notion of him as a fig leaf president. He was widely criticized for presiding over the hollowing out of what remains of Iran\u2019s institutions. Legislative elections this March had a record low turnout of 41%.\u00a0The 2022 nationwide uprising posed the biggest domestic threat to the regime in decades. Since the brutal crushing of those protests, the bridge between the regime and its young and largely disgruntled population has grown ever wider. \u201cKhamenei has put the Islamic Republic on a path in which it will only be able to remain in power by increasing repression,\u201d said Parsi. Choosing to open up the election may appease the country\u2019s frustrated young population buckling under continued economic and political strains. That may set Iran on a course to stabilize its restive domestic situation. It may also pave a path for a more Western-friendly administration like that of Rouhani, which presided over the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, albeit within the confines set by Khamenei. Yet analysts say this remains wishful thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see why Khamenei would change course at this point. It would necessitate that he recognizes that he is on a path that is not good for him, but that\u2019s not the conclusion the regime has come to,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cBecause of the succession (of the Supreme Leadership), the regime wants the status quo. They\u2019re going to choose a direction that keeps everything as-is.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/middleeast/raisi-funeral-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

More than 300 people are known to have\u00a0died on the mountain. Spring is the prime time to climb Everest, although some mountaineers might climb in the less favorable autumn season. Most climbers try to ascend the peak in May. There\u2019s a brief window of time \u2013 usually after mid-May \u2013 when temperatures are warmer, and the high-altitude winds known as the jet stream have moved away from the mountains.

{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_china-taiwan-drills-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Tensions are once again ratcheting up in the Taiwan Strait, with China launching two days of military drills encircling Taiwan just days after the democracy swore in a new leader long loathed by Beijing. The exercises began early Thursday, in what China described as \u201cpunishment\u201d for \u201cseparatist acts\u201d \u2013 alluding to the election and inauguration of the self-governing island\u2019s new President Lai Ching-te. China\u2019s military says the drills are designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over Taiwan. Though relations between the two sides have been steadily worsening in recent years, this latest escalation marks a significant test for Taiwan\u2019s new leader, whose ruling party has championed democracy in the face of growing threats\u00a0from its authoritarian neighbor. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.\u00a0And it has become much more bellicose under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What\u2019s happening with the drills? The Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) said it launched joint military drills involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force in areas around Taiwan early\u00a0Thursday morning. The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the self-ruling island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan. They are also taking place in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off China\u2019s southeastern coast, the command said in a statement. Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, called the exercises \u201ca strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.\u201d As part of the drills on Thursday, dozens of Chinese fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes against \u201chigh-value military targets\u201d of the \u201cenemy\u201d alongside destroyers, frigates and missile speedboats, according to China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV. On Friday, the Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to \u201ctest the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.\u201d CCTV aired\u00a0footage that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire. China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally. Chinese state media heavily covered the drills while the military also posted footage on social media. The exercises subsequently went viral on China\u2019s heavily regulated internet. How has Taiwan reacted? Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had dispatched sea, air and ground forces to respond to China\u2019s drills. It expressed regret at \u201csuch irrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.\u201d Taiwan has also been closely monitoring China\u2019s warplanes and naval ships that came close to the island. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, 19 warships and seven coast guard vessels. The island\u2019s presidential office said in a statement that it was \u201cconfident and capable of defending national security,\u201d accusing China of \u201cusing unilateral military provocation to threaten Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom.\u201d But despite Beijing\u2019s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China\u2019s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years. \u201cWe are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,\u201d\u00a0an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN. \u201cIf the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won\u2019t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.\u201d What triggered this? The most obvious answer is Lai\u2019s inauguration on Monday. Lai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), now in power for a historic third term, views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation with a distinct Taiwanese identity. Ahead of Taiwan\u2019s elections back in January, Beijing had warned that a Lai victory could inflame tensions and spark conflict \u2013 repeatedly framing the vote as a choice between \u201cpeace and war.\u201d Taiwanese voters dismissed those warnings, returning the DPP to power \u2013 although two opposition parties that favor closer ties with China now have a majority in parliament. China\u2019s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, \u201ctroublemaker\u201d and \u201cwar maker,\u201d while rejecting his repeated offers of talks. Their vehement dislike of Lai is rooted in his political past, as well as Beijing\u2019s refusal to deal directly with a huge swathe of Taiwan\u2019s leaders. The 64-year-old former doctor and political veteran was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence \u2013 a red line for Beijing. His views have tempered over the years, and he now says he favors the status quo, saying there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence since the island is \u201calready an independent sovereign country.\u201d But Beijing has never forgiven him for those early comments \u2013 making its stance clear with the drills on Thursday. Lai, too, has set the tone for his new administration\u2019s approach to China \u2013 using his inaugural speech on Monday to declare that a \u201cglorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived,\u201d and reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty. He also called on Beijing to cease its \u201cintimidation\u201d of Taiwan and respect that its people want to decide their own destiny. What\u2019s the relationship between China and Taiwan? The Chinese Civil War ended with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) taking power in the mainland, establishing the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing in 1949. The defeated Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, moving the seat of their Republic of China (ROC) government from the mainland to Taipei. Both proclaimed themselves the sole rightful government of the entire Chinese territory. In recent years, Taiwan has downplayed its territorial claims over mainland China, and is today a vibrant democracy, with its own military, currency, constitution and elected government. But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world.\u00a0Over the decades it has become increasingly isolated, with a number of governments switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\u00a0But unofficial diplomatic ties with many Western nations have in fact been bolstered in recent years, in part thanks to China\u2019s saber-rattling. Meanwhile, under Xi, China has become increasingly assertive in foreign policy and grown more authoritarian at home. China has cut official communication with Taiwan since the DPP took office in 2016, and has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on the island. At the same time, ties between Taipei and Washington have become more robust, with increased arms sales and high-level political engagement under Lai\u2019s popular predecessor Tsai Ing-wen. This has infuriated Beijing, spurring it to unleash more pressure on Taiwan and sending cross-strait relations on a downward spiral. Where does the US stand in this? The US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 \u2013 but has long trod a delicate middle path. In what is known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, Washington recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China; it also acknowledges Beijing\u2019s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never accepted the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s claim of sovereignty over the island. The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, which have been strengthened in recent years. It is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and supplies it with defensive weaponry. American lawmakers regularly visit Taiwan and have supported legislation to bolster US support for the island and its defensive capabilities. But it has historically remained deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as \u201cstrategic ambiguity.\u201d After the election in January, the US sent a bipartisan delegation to Taiwan, where they met with Lai and Tsai \u2013 and promised that American support for\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0will continue no matter who wins the upcoming US election. Beijing on Tuesday also announced sanctions against former US House Representative Mike Gallagher, who led that delegation, citing his \u201cremarks and actions\u201d that \u201cinterfere\u201d in China\u2019s internal affairs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-taiwan-drills-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_and-just-like-that-carrie-bradshaw-fashion-lotw", "text": "Carrie Bradshaw, the lead character played by Sarah Jessica Parker in the 1998-2004 TV series \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has always been more of a fashion daredevil than a fashion darling. From the time she wore a floating belt fastened across her bare midriff (season 4 episode 15) to the cowboy hat, python-print bandeau and striped sarong (season 2, episode 17), Parker\u2019s on-screen persona has never shied away from making a bold style statement. Bradshaw\u2019s sartorial abandon has long been part of her quirky allure. The Instagram account, @everyoutfitonsatc, has provided a diligent digital archive of the character\u2019s best looks for its 746,000 followers. Many of the early SATC outfits documented are met with pure adoration by a throng of Carrie apologists ready to jump to her defense in the comments, even for the more visually challenging ensembles. \u201cThis is one of my favorite Carrie looks! Something only she could\u2019ve pulled off,\u201d wrote one fan under an image of Bradshaw in a clashing neon pink and green Betsy Johnson tulle dress \u2014 complete with abstract printed leggings. \u201cShe\u2019d look fabulous wearing anything.\u201d But since the launch of the series reboot \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d in 2021, Bradshaw\u2019s wacky wardrobe has drawn more criticism than kudos. (HBO and Max, which airs \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026,\u201d are also owned by CNN\u2019s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) As filming for the show\u2019s third season continues around New York City, Bradshaw has so far been spotted in ensembles including wearing a sheer, rose-stuffed frock from the Irish designer Simone Rocha (pictured above), as well as a vintage color-blocked Ossie Clark dress and an oversize floppy Maryam Keyhani gingham sun hat. These looks have seemingly fallen flat with some viewers of the show. \u201cDefinitely too much,\u201d read one critique under @everyoutfitonsatc\u2019s post of Jessica Parker in the latter look. \u201cThis was not Carrie\u2019s style\u2026 This is trash,\u201d read another. (Commentary surrounding the Simone Rocha-designed look was somewhat kinder, however, with dedicated followers of Bradshaw\u2019s fashions showing appreciation for the nod to the character\u2019s love of florals \u2014 and a visible bra. So was the response to the first new look Jessica Parker was spotted in while filming in recent weeks: A pair of prissy vintage pastel separates from YSL and Ralph Lauren respectively.) The departure of Patricia Field, longtime stylist on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has given some sartorially-minded viewers of \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d a scapegoat for their grumblings. But Field plowed her own absurdist furrow when curating her characters\u2019 wardrobes (and beyond). \u201cFollowing fashion trends? It\u2019s a waste,\u201d she told The Guardian in February. \u201cTo me, fashion is a cousin of art. And like art, originality is what counts. When it starts to feel intimidating, it\u2019s time to change.\u201d It\u2019s an instinct that the show\u2019s current stylists, Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago, have honored with Bradshaw\u2019s melting pot of patterns and silhouettes \u2014 but one that has gone under appreciated. So has Bradshaw\u2019s style really changed, or have we? Are audiences less tolerant towards an off-beat dresser in her late 50s, when compared to one in her 30s? It seems like a ripe topic for the character\u2019s newspaper column, and one Jessica Parker has thoughts on too. \u201cThere\u2019s so much misogynist chatter in response to us that would never. Happen. About. A. Man,\u201d the actor told Vogue in 2021. \u201cEspecially on social media. Everyone has something to say.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/and-just-like-that-carrie-bradshaw-fashion-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_sport_scotland-soccer-religious-bigotry-intl-spt", "text": "Surrounded by medics, Hibernian FC player Martin Boyle lay on the pitch after diving for the ball in a Scottish Cup quarterfinal earlier this year and landing awkwardly on his head \u2013 the then 30-year-old suffered a concussion \u2013 an injury he would later describe as having sent him to \u201chell and back.\u201d The game was stopped for around 10 minutes, but as medics tended to the injured forward, chants of \u201cdie ya Fenian bastard\u201d sung by some fans of the opposing team Rangers FC echoed throughout the stadium in Edinburgh. Fenian refers to a group of 19th\u00a0century Irish revolutionaries but is widely recognized as a derogatory term for Irish Catholics. The language mirrors the division caused by centuries of war and strife between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, in part because of the west of Scotland\u2019s close historical links with Northern Ireland. \u201cOver recent years supporters\u2019 unacceptable conduct has become rife in Scotland whether that be through the use of pyrotechnics, sectarianism, objects being thrown onto the field of play or through other actions,\u201d Hibernian FC, commonly known as Hibs said in a statement in response to the chanting. Police Scotland told CNN it had received no reports regarding fans\u2019 behavior towards Boyle. A spokesperson added: \u201cI can confirm a man was arrested in connection with comments being made towards Rangers fans/staff, however, he was released without charge.\u201d David Scott, director of Nil by Mouth \u2013 a Scottish charity that campaigns against religious bigotry \u2013 told CNN \u201csectarianism is something that\u2019s very woven into the game of football.\u201d He explained that \u201cpassion, performance, poison\u201d are at the heart of the game in Scotland, with bigoted chanting taking the forefront. \u201cIt was a historic problem born of the Catholic-Protestant divide in Scottish society, especially in the West of Scotland. And it became greatly manifest in football,\u201d Scottish sports journalist Graham Spiers told CNN. \u201cThat in the main has meant anti-Catholic chanting. This is not anti-Protestant. It\u2019s not anti-Asian, it\u2019s not anti-Semitic. In the main, it has been about anti-Catholic and anti-Irish chanting,\u201d Spiers added. A problem rooted in history The fierce rivalry between Glasgow\u2019s two most famous teams \u2013 Celtic FC and Rangers \u2013 is historically one of the most vivid examples of sectarianism in Scottish football, and society. The two teams play each other in Saturday\u2019s Scottish Cup final. Historically chants have included anti-Catholic religious bigotry, or vocal support for paramilitary groups like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Celtic, founded by an Irish member of a Catholic religious order in 1887, wears its heritage proudly in the four-leaf clover of its team emblem. Meanwhile, Rangers, founded in 1872, was \u201chistorically and shamefully\u201d a mostly Protestant club until the 1980s, Spiers explained. \u201cRangers didn\u2019t hide it, they were proud of the fact they were all Protestant,\u201d he said. These historically religious identities and rivalries \u2013 often described as \u201cScotland\u2019s shame\u201d \u2013 extend to other Scottish clubs, including Edinburgh\u2019s historically Catholic Hibernian and Protestant Hearts of Midlothian FC. Perhaps the most violent chapter in the sectarian sports rivalry happened in 1995, when 16-year-old Celtic fan Mark Scott was killed by a man who police say had family links to a Protestant paramilitary group.  Scott was wearing a Celtic scarf while walking past a pub frequented by Loyalist fans on his way home from a match on the day of his murder. Jason Campbell was arrested, tried and convicted in 1996 for the killing. He was sentenced to life in prison but was freed on parole in 2011 following human rights legislation. And though Scotland has become more secular than when these clubs were founded some 150 years ago, \u201cthese tribal loyalties remain,\u201d said Nil by Mouth\u2019s Scott. \u201cWhen you\u2019re singing and chanting these things, you may think you\u2019re just thinking about your tradition, your background, but actually other people may just hear the hatred and agonism,\u201d said Scott. \u201cAcross the city, people will sing songs, \u2018We\u2019re up to our knees in Fenian blood, surrender or you\u2019ll die.\u2019 \u201cThey will tell you that, \u2018This is just theater, these are just words that don\u2019t mean anything, these are football chants,\u2019 that people like me are taking it too seriously. It\u2019s all culture. But it can also be a very intimidating atmosphere to be at,\u201d Scott added. According to Spiers, Celtic\u2019s support is \u201cmaybe 70% Catholic, but with a very large Protestant minority, who are Celtic fans. And they also have songs about \u2018Orange [named after King William III, also known as William of Orange and a political society] bastards,\u2019 meaning Protestants.\u201d Geographically, these are clubs whose support cuts across the geography of Scotland as well as social class, said Scott. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go to church anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t live in these kinds of working class communities in Scotland where they used to do \u2013 people are more spread out. I think football becomes this kind of social cement that links people to parts of their past.\u201d Authorities have tried to tackle the problem, introducing legislation including The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012, which was repealed in 2018. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching football matches with five or 10,000 people or whatever it is shouting and chanting, you can\u2019t arrest them. So you have to come up with a system of addressing that,\u201d Scott explained. There were 576 charges with a religious aggravation reported in 2022-23 according to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), an 8% increase on the previous 12 months. The COPFS reports that \u201cover the last five years, the number of religious charges reported has fluctuated between around 530 and 670 per year.\u201d This April, Scotland\u2019s new hate crime law came into force, which focuses on \u201cstirring up hatred,\u201d \u201cracially aggravated harassment\u201d and crimes \u201caggravated by prejudice\u201d with regard to age, disability, impairment, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity and sex characteristics \u2013 though Scott describes this law as a \u201cred herring\u201d when it comes to addressing bigotry in football given previous legislation\u00a0didn\u2019t solve the problem. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government told CNN that it is \u201cfully committed to tackling all forms of bigotry and prejudice including sectarianism.\u201d The spokesperson highlighted the new Hate Crime and Public Order Act as a mechanism to tackle hatred and prejudice, and said the government would support the police in \u201ctaking appropriate and proportionate action to safeguard public safety.\u201d Joseph Webster, Professor of the Anthropology of Religion at the University of Cambridge, told CNN that his own research shows that the majority of \u201coffensive chanting\u201d occurs when only one fan group is present, in spaces like a social club or pub, and can \u201cfoster intra-group solidarity.\u201d Webster added that his research shows an unintended consequence of the now defunct Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 \u201cis that those fan bases feel unfairly targeted by the police, and the result is they look inward, among themselves even further, and the chanting then escalates.\u201d CNN has reached out to Police Scotland, Scottish Football Association, Rangers and Celtic for comment. Hiding a wider problem Jeanette Findlay, the Chair, and a founding member of Call it Out, a campaign against anti-Irish racism and anti-Catholic bigotry, said that outrage over anti-Catholic chanting in football is \u201ca long running diversion by the Scottish government, Scottish society.\u201d \u201cThe Scottish government and polite Scottish society don\u2019t like to acknowledge that there is, across Scottish society, geographically and in class terms, a continued anti-Catholic bigotry,\u201d she told CNN Sport, explaining that the vast majority of Catholics in Scotland are of Irish descent. The Scottish Government referred CNN to its previous statement when asked about these claims. Findlay says that the government often comments that the problem is contained to football, and by association, areas lived in by the working class. \u201cCatholics are more likely to live in poorer areas, they are over represented in the prison system, hugely overrepresented in religious aggravated hate crime. We are over represented in certain health conditions,\u201d she added. Scottish government data backs up those observations of Findlay. In almost half of religion aggravated hate crimes, \u201cthe perpetrator showed prejudice towards the Catholic community\u201d (47%), according to a Police Scotland report which reviewed recorded crimes in 2020-21. The next largest groups were Muslims and Protestants, who each made up 16% of cases, the report data based on a random sample of cases, found. In 2022-23, police noted that around one in 10 hate crimes were religiously aggravated, though this data set did not disclose which religions were targeted. Findlay said that, while she has heard hostile chants at football matches, \u201cfrankly, I\u2019m more concerned with the employment statistics, and the justice statistics and the health statistics which are more of a problem for us.\u201d \u201cSomeone calling us a Fenian bastard and threatening us on a football pitch doesn\u2019t cause us much trouble. \u201cIf they were marching past places of worship, spitting on our priests and vandalizing our churches, that\u2019s a problem. If they were standing at the door, shouting up, that should be dealt with,\u201d she added. Journalist Spiers said that, although Rangers \u201cmodernized\u201d long ago following pressure from fans and the media, prejudicial songs and their associated meanings \u201cstill hangs around Rangers like a bad stench.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been at Rangers games in recent years where the atmosphere has been great \u2013 nobody is more sensitive than I am to chanting because God knows I\u2019ve written about it for 25 years.\u201d But \u201cevery so often, it will flare up and we all go. \u2018All right. It\u2019s still there. The old problem is still there.\u2019 But it\u2019s not as regular as it was 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago\u201d Spiers added. \u201cPeople find it tedious and boring and tragic. I\u2019m not actually offended by these chants, but I\u2019m embarrassed for my country. I\u2019m embarrassed for Scotland, that people will say \u2013 why are they singing about Catholics, you know, as if it\u2019s as if it\u2019s the 1920s or the 1890s?\u201d Webster is one of many who cautions against relying on legislation alone to deal with bigotry, adding: \u201cI think most people would agree that you can\u2019t prevent someone from holding bigoted attitudes by arresting them.\u201d Celtic recently won the Scottish Premiership, edging Rangers to the title. Saturday\u2019s cup final offers Rangers a chance to stop its rival from winning the double, but given the clubs\u2019 complicated history, how their respective fanbases behave will also be closely watched.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/sport/scotland-soccer-religious-bigotry-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_middleeast_israel-icj-gaza-rafah-south-africa-ruling-intl", "text": "The United Nations\u2019 top court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, further increasing international pressure on Israel over its war against Hamas. \u201cIsrael must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in Rafah which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part,\u201d Judge Nawaf Salam, president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said on Friday. The court considers the humanitarian situation in Rafah to be classified as \u201cdisastrous,\u201d he said, adding that UN officials have indicated that the situation was set to \u201cintensify even further\u201d if the Israeli operation in Rafah continues. Israel began a limited ground offensive in Rafah on May 7, defying calls from the international community, including the United States, not to proceed. More than a million Palestinians were taking shelter in Rafah before Israel started its operation, but the court noted that around 800,000 have since been displaced. Upon entering Rafah, the military\u00a0seized the city\u2019s border crossing\u00a0with Egypt, which has remained shut since. The crossing was a vital entry point for humanitarian aid. The court ordered Israel to open the Rafah crossing for humanitarian assistance and said it had found that the evacuation and living conditions provided by Israel are not \u201csufficient to alleviate the immense risk, which the Palestinian population is exposed\u201d to.  Rulings by the court are final and binding, but the ICJ doesn\u2019t have a mechanism to enforce them, and they have been ignored in the past. Israeli officials have condemned the ICJ\u2019s ruling. Yair Lapid, leader of Israel\u2019s opposition party Yesh Atid, said that \u201cthe fact that the ICJ did not even directly connect the end of the military operation in Rafah to the release of the hostages and to Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terror is an abject moral failure.\u201d Naftali Bennett, who was the 13th\u00a0Prime Minister of Israel, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201cThe International Court of Justice just provided every terror organization on earth with THE PERFECT METHOD TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.\u201d Hamas welcomed the order in a statement, but said it had expected it would be for the entire Gaza Strip, emphasizing that the situations in Jabalya and other cities are equally dire and warrant similar attention. South Africa filed an urgent request on May 10 for additional measures against Israel, accusing it of using forced\u00a0evacuation orders\u00a0in the southern Gaza city of Rafah to \u201cendanger rather than protect civilian life.\u201d The request was part of a larger case brought by Pretoria against Israel in which South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians during the seven-month-long conflict. Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General for International Law Gilad Noam denied the allegations in his opening remarks at the ICJ last week and asked the court to \u201crespect the predicament\u201d Israel is in. Two interpretations Following the ruling, a joint statement by the Israel\u2019s National Security Council and Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that Israel \u201chas not carried out and will not carry out military activity in the Rafah area that creates living conditions that could lead to the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population.\u201d In response to other orders by the ICJ, including keeping the Rafah crossing open, the statement said that Israel will \u201ccontinue its efforts to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip\u201d and \u201creduce as much as possible the harm to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN that the text of the ruling had some ambiguity. \u201cThe order can be understood in two ways: either that Israel has to halt the offensive in Rafah; or specifically components that may lead to conditions of life that could bring physical destruction,\u201d he said. What is clear, however, is that in the eyes of the court, \u201cthe operation cannot continue in the same way, because it found that as it is now the situation is a risk to the rights protected by the (genocide) Convention,\u201d Lieblich said, adding that it is hard to tell whether Israel will comply with the ruling. \u201cI\u00a0hope that it doesn\u2019t argue that the order means that nothing has to change, because that clearly isn\u2019t the case,\u201d he added. The development comes as Israel faces mounting international and domestic pressure to end the war in Gaza. This week, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate court in The Hague, sought arrest warrants for Hamas leaders as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Families of Israeli hostages held in the territory also stepped up pressure on Netanyahu to bring the captives home, releasing graphic footage of female members of the Israel Defense Forces before they were abducted. Unclear how US will respond It is unclear how the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally, will respond to the ICJ\u2019s order. The Biden administration has spoken out strongly against the genocide case against Israel, but it has repeatedly warned Israel that Washington will not support a major ground offensive in Rafah unless it sees a credible plan to ensure the safety of civilians. This month, the US halted arms shipments to Israel for the first time out of fear that they could be used in Rafah to harm civilians. In an interview with CNN, US President Joe Biden acknowledged that American bombs had been used to kill civilians in Gaza, in a stark recognition of the US\u2019 role in the war. The US is Israel\u2019s biggest weapons supplier. The move by the ICJ is likely to add to mounting pressure on Israel to scale down its war in Gaza, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that his country will defend itself even if \u201cforced to stand alone.\u201d Israel says that Rafah is the last bastion of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Israel\u2019s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 people, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 pressure The international pressure facing Israel is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN. \u201cBecause this war is unprecedented, and the way Israel conducts the war is unprecedented.\u201d While there has always been criticism of some of Israel\u2019s actions, such as the expansion of settlements, \u201cthis is on a different scale, a different universe altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current Israeli government does its best to make Israel a pariah state.\u201d The ruling could also undermine Israel\u2019s own judiciary, according to Neve Gordon, professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London. In response to the ICC\u2019s decision to seek arrest warrants against top Israeli officials, Israel\u2019s Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and State Attorney Amit Aisman were cited by the Times of Israel as backing the Israeli military and said the judicial system is capable of handling such cases. \u201c(The) ruling would serve yet another blow to Israel\u2019s judicial system, and particularly the attorney general and the Supreme Court, since the subtext would be that it is not doing its job in ensuring that Israel abide by international law,\u201d said Gordon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-icj-gaza-rafah-south-africa-ruling-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

Cracks in walls and falling cornices were reported, Italy\u2019s Fire Brigade spokesman confirmed to CNN. The 4.4 earthquake at a depth of 3 kilometers is the strongest earthquake to hit the highly seismic area in the past 40 years, according to INGV data. The quake is part of an ongoing \u201cseismic storm\u201d that has seen more than a dozen events over 2.0 magnitude in the past 48 hours. The 4.4 tremblor at 8:10 p.m. local time was preceded by a 3.5 earthquake an hour earlier. The INGV recorded 1,252 earthquakes in the Campi Flegrei area in the month of April 2024, most with a magnitude less than 1.0. The last major eruption of the supervolcano was in 1538, which resulted in the creation of a new bay on the southern Italian coast. The INGV has noted an increase of seismic activity since 2022, which could be due either to the building up of magma under the surface or the building up of gases, according to several volcanologists. The volcano is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Mt. Vesuvius, and prone to a phenomenon known as bradyseism, during which the ground raises and falls due to pressure under the surface. The last major cycle was in 1984, but several volcanologists told CNN that the area is experiencing a new cycle of the phenomenon. More than 500,000 people live in the red zone directly adjacent to the Campi Flegrei, according to the Italian Civil Protection agency, which has been working this year to update evacuation plans in the event of a major disaster.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/europe/earthquake-italy-campi-flegrei-super-volcano-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

It was a cagey encounter, with clearcut chances few and far between as both teams\u2019 defenses canceled out one another. Aitana Bonmat\u00ed opened the scoring at the San Mam\u00e9s Stadium, her left-footed strike midway through the second half deflecting into the Lyon goal. And in the final few moments, Al\u00e8xia Putellas wrapped up a famous victory with her 190th goal for the club. The victory, Barcelona\u2019s third Women\u2019s Champions League title, completes a historic quadruple this season for the Spanish giant \u2013 the Blaugrana has already won the Liga F, Copa de la Reina and Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a trophies. It cements Bar\u00e7a\u2019s status as the one of the best club teams in world soccer over the last few years. \u201cWe knew we needed to be a club that made history,\u201d Barcelona defender Lucy Bronze told broadcaster DAZN afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s hard to win it once, but to do it back to back, Lyon showed how difficult it is. \u201cThis team\u2019s finally done that. I think we go down in history as one of the best teams in Europe.\u201d Tight margins The final was a clash of Europe\u2019s two titanic sides; Barcelona has soared to ascendancy over recent years while Lyon has dominated the competition since first winning it in 2011 \u2013 Saturday\u2019s final was the club\u2019s 11th Women\u2019s Champions League final and its eight titles is double that of any other team. With the game being played in Spain, the atmosphere inside the San Mam\u00e9s felt like a home game for Barcelona with the stadium dominated by its famous red and blue colors. And with such high stakes on the line, there was little to separate the two teams. Both sets of defenders reigned supreme, with chances at a premium. After a cagey opening 45 minutes, Barcelona carved the best opportunity to break the deadlock on the stroke of halftime, with Caroline Graham Hansen\u2019s tricky run bamboozling defenders but the Norwegian international could only drag her shot past the post. Just minutes into the second half, Lyon could have taken a lead against the run of play but Wendie Renard was unable to keep her effort down. With little two separate the two teams, it took a moment of magic to open the scoring. Bonmat\u00ed, the 2023 Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin winner, received a delicate pass from Mariona Caldentey before dancing into the Lyon box and firing a left-footed effort towards goal. Her attempt took a slight deflection off a despairing defender which lifted it into the roof of the net and sent the majority inside the San Mam\u00e9s Stadium delirious. That goal seemed to open up proceedings, with Lyon now needing a goal to claw its way back into the final. Lyon piled the pressure on Barcelona but some heroic Blaugrana defense held strong, with only some last ditch interventions preventing the French side drawing level. The addition of Lyon\u2019s talismanic striker, Ada Hegerberg, offered a physical target for Lyon to play off but the Norwegian striker was forced to feed off scraps as Barcelona\u2019s defenders fielded a barrage of crosses. And with Lyon pressing, a storybook evening in Bilbao was capped off in fine fashion when Putellas \u2013 who has dealt with injuries over recent years but remains a legend at Barcelona \u2013 rifled the ball into the top of the net to seal the victory in stoppage time and get the party started. In Bonmat\u00ed and Putellas, Barcelona has two Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin winners and they both showed their match-winning capabilities to cap a magical season.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/sport/barcelona-lyon-womens-champions-league-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

Facts Mount St. Helens is located in Washington, about 55 miles northeast of Portland, Oregon, and 95 miles south of Seattle.  It is administered by the National Forest Service, not the National Park Service.  Over the last 500 years, Mount St. Helens has had at least four major explosive eruptions and many minor eruptions. Mount St. Helens was named by Commander George Vancouver for British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert, whose title was Baron St. Helens.  Timeline 1792-1794 - The mountain is named while Commander Vancouver is surveying the northern Pacific coast. 1835 - Is first recognized as a volcano. 1857-1980 - Is inactive. May 18, 1980 - Erupts. Fifty-seven people are killed. Damage caused by the blast costs $1.1 billion. Hot ash causes forest fires. Snow melt from the top of the mountain causes floods. Volcanic ash spreads across the Northwest. More than 900,000 tons of ash are cleaned up from areas around Washington. 1980-1986 - Many small eruptions occur. September 2004 - Several days of unusual seismic activity lead seismologists to believe that an explosion resulting from steam buildup is likely to occur. October 2004 - Several small steam and ash explosions occur. March 8, 2005 - Releases a column of smoke and ash nearly six miles high, leaving a plume visible for more than 50 miles. January 2008 - Eruptions that have occured continously since October 2004 cease. July 2014 - Final preparations begin for what geophysicists call the \u201cequivalent of a combined ultrasound and CAT scan\u201d of the inside of the volcano. The joint project by scientists at Rice University, the University of Washington, the University of Texas at El Paso and others involves placing 3,500 seismic sensors around the volcano. The project will take four years and aims to improve volcanic monitoring and advance warning systems. November 3, 2015 - Scientists investigating the interior of the volcano present the first results at the Geological Society of America convention, saying there is not only a magma chamber directly below Mount St. Helens, there are other chambers east of the mountain that appear to be connected, with magma flowing between them.  Spring 2016 - Over the course of eight weeks, more than 130 small earthquakes occur beneath the surface of Mount St. Helens. October 2018 - Ranks No. 2 on the US Geological Survey\u2019s report of the most threatening volcanoes in the United States. The volcano is deemed a \u201cvery high threat\u201d based on hazards posed to people and infrastructure.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2013/07/26/weather/mount-st-helens-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

The congestion charge was introduced in 2003 in order to stem traffic and pollution in central London. Drivers within the congestion charge zone are required to pay a $19 daily charge between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays and 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. on weekends. TfL says it will pursue all unpaid fees and said in a statement it is even \u201cpushing for the matter to be taken up at the International Court of Justice.\u201d The US embassy has declined to pay up and is claiming diplomatic immunity from the fines. \u201cIn accordance with international law as reflected in the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, our position is that the Congestion Charge is a tax from which diplomatic missions are exempt,\u201d\u00a0a US embassy spokesperson said. \u201cOur long-standing position is shared by many other diplomatic missions in London,\u201d the spokesperson added. However, TfL is insisting that in agreement with the UK government, London\u2019s congestion charge constitutes a service and not tax. \u201cThis means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it.\u201d It has also politely declared there to be a \u201cstubborn minority\u201d of embassies that do not pay the charge, despite \u201crepresentations through diplomatic channels,\u201d and posted a lengthy list of offenders. As of December 31, 2023, a total of 161 embassies, high commissions and consulates owed more than $182 million combined in unpaid congestion charge fees, according to TfL data. According to TfL\u2019s figures, the Japanese embassy owes the second highest amount from unpaid congestion charge fees, at around $12.8 million.  This not the first time a dispute has emerged over whether the US embassy should pay the charge. In July 2005, the embassy issued a diplomatic note, claiming the charge \u201cis a tax that cannot be lawfully imposed on the U.S. Government, its diplomatic and consular personnel, or its military force.\u201d While the embassy initially paid the charge, it stopped doing so on July 12, 2005, declaring the charge to be \u201cin tension\u201d with \u201cduties owed to foreign missions and diplomats.\u201d In 2020, then UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British officials held \u201cmeetings with a number of diplomatic missions and international organisations\u201d to press for \u201cpayment of outstanding fines and debt,\u201d including \u201cunpaid congestion charge\u201d fees.

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1", "text": "The Monaco Grand Prix gets underway this weekend in Monte Carlo with its heady combination of glamor and adrenaline, not only for the tens of thousands who descend on the pristine principality, but for the millions watching across the world. Even those who are typically indifferent to motorsports can find themselves enraptured, or at least intrigued, by the sheer spectacle of Formula One cars hurtling along the country\u2019s winding streets. It is also where you will find celebrities happily jostling their way through the crowds and cameras. \u201cIt is unlike anything I have ever been to, it is electric,\u201d exclaimed Spider-Man actor Tom Holland while walking last year\u2019s grid. And of course, there is plenty of wealth on display. Monaco is nicknamed \u201cthe billionaires\u2019 playground\u201d for good reason. Here, designer stores, supercars, multi-million-dollar yachts and astronomically priced restaurants are \u2018la norme\u2019, but during the three-day Grand Prix, the eye-watering ostentation increases three-fold. When demand is high and options are limited, it is all to play for among the world\u2019s wealthiest who are keen to revel in the race\u2019s iconic location and party \u2018til dawn. If they are not using their own superyacht as a base, they might book into a private villa on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur or check-in to Fairmont Hotel, H\u00f4tel Hermitage or H\u00f4tel de Paris in Monte Carlo itself. A pioneer of Grand Prix party culture Of course, it is not only about finding the finest suites to rest your head, but the premium spots for dining and clubbing, whether it is the top table at Cipriani, Sass Caf\u00e9 or Caf\u00e9 de Paris or the best booth at exclusive night spots such as Jimmy\u2019z or Amber Lounge. The latter has the distinction of being the go-to destination for the F1 fraternity, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, while previous guests have included Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Minogue and Prince Albert of Monaco. Established in 2003 by former racing driver Eddie Irvine\u2019s sister Sonia as a \u201cpost-race destination\u201d for drivers and VIP guests, Amber Lounge is regarded a pioneer of the Grand Prix party culture. Notably, it will be marking its 20-year milestone (there was a year off during Covid) as \u201cthe most exclusive party in the world\u201d with panache over the Monaco weekend with three nights of events costing just over \u20ac1.5m ($1.6m) to produce. There will be after parties at an Amber Lounge beach club on the terrace of Le Meridien Beach Plaza (the only hotel in Monte Carlo with its own private beach), as well as VIP viewing of the race from aboard a 108ft superyacht moored just feet from the circuit\u2019s famous Tabac corner. \u201cThe size of the yacht also means we are as close to the action as you can get, unlike the larger yachts that are pulled back (from the coast). It also feels more intimate and exclusive on board. We have a lot of repeat clients (typically from the US, UK and Middle East) who want to network and build relationships,\u201d said Lauren Green, Managing Director of Amber Lounge who oversees logistics of the three-day pop-up event in Monaco, as well as other F1 locations including Singapore, Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi. Unsurprisingly, a ticket to one of the most coveted trackside spots does not come cheap. A one-day VIP viewing package for the race itself on Sunday costs \u20ac3,500 ($3,800) per person \u2014 and the 65 available tickets sold out within two weeks of going on sale in May 2023. While the dress code is \u2018Riviera chic,\u2019 shoes, however expensive, must be discarded on embarking so as not to ruin the yacht\u2019s teak decking. Tickets include free-flowing beverages, including champagne, wine and signature cocktails, as well as food, a DJ and dancers before tenders return to shore at 6.30pm. \u2018The center of the universe for a weekend\u2019 At the club\u2019s after parties held over the race weekend, a small army of waiting staff serve ever-flowing drinks for a 1000 strong crowd on Saturday and Sunday nights. On arrival, guests ring a bell and a gloved hand appears through a flower wall proffering a glass of champagne. Attendees have paid anything from \u20ac600 ($650) for entry to the afterparty on Saturday (the F1 qualifying day) to \u20ac800 ($870) on the Sunday (race day) in the hope they can party alongside drivers, celebrities and guests of high net worth, away from the public gaze. For \u20ac40,000 ($43,400), partygoers can book what\u2019s known as a \u201cdiamond table package\u201d for 10 people \u2014 a prime table with unobstructed views of the stage and DJ booth (Fatman Scoop and Jax Jones are the acts for 2024), as well as cirqus-themed performances, and Methuselahs of champagne (6-liters) and premium vodka. Add an extra \u20ac10,000 ($10,800) on for a Salmanazar \u2014 a nine-liter bottle of champagne that requires a team of four to carry it to the table, or \u20ac20,000 ($21,600) for a 12-liter Balthazar-sized bottle. The top-tier tables also have their own \u201chosts,\u201d who act as a concierge; liaising with VIPs\u2019 assistants or drivers to ensure guests can be greeted and escorted along the black carpet without having to queue. Amber Lounge might be one of the most exclusive and expensive events taking place during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, but Monte Carlo itself is a veritable party hub. It\u2019s common for champagne glasses and bottles to be cleared from the track from the previous night\u2019s revelry ahead of that day\u2019s qualifying or race sessions. \u201cThe C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur is one of the truly exceptional global destinations, and Monaco is at the heart of it. The scenery, the sophistication, and the opulence are unmatched,\u201d said Bruce Bundrant, Senior Vice President of Business Development for rEvolution, a global sports marketing agency who lived in Monaco for three years as Commercial Director for AS Monaco FC. \u201cAs a former resident, I can tell you there are two sides to the F1 Grand Prix arriving in Monaco. On one side, your town is now the center of the universe for a weekend where the top 1% of the 1% from all over the world arrive and engage in outrageous parties and events on yachts, at luxury hotels suites, and in hilltop mansions,\u201d Bundrant explained. \u201cOn the other, it\u2019s the hybrid of the arrival of a hurricane and New Year\u2019s Eve. A week out from the race, grocery store shelves are emptied as locals know it\u2019s impossible to move around the principality when the F1 circus is in town. During the Grand Prix, your quiet, regular neighborhood bar has a line around the corner, charges a $100 cover charge, and a drink that typically costs $20 will be $50. But it\u2019s a truly unforgettable weekend, with an unreplicable buzz and energy. Sure, it\u2019s expensive, but come the Monday, things are back to normal.\u201d As normal as it can ever be in a place as excessive as Monaco. As the jet set move onto their next port of call, and the racetrack is dismantled, so too is the Amber Lounge club as preparations continue for their next F1 event, which will be Singapore in September. \u201cThere is no rest at Amber Lounge,\u201d Green quipped. \u201cJust a lot of adrenaline. And a lot of coffee.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "world"}}
