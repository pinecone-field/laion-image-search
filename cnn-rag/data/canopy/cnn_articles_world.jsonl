To win a working parliamentary majority of over 170 seats just four-and-a-half years after his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, led the party to its worst loss in a generation is nothing short of remarkable. Starmer was arguably elected on a mandate of change rather than on a personal endorsement. It is no secret that a large number of voters were not voting exactly for Starmer himself, but to get rid of a Conservative Party that had been in power for 14 years and led the country through some of its most chaotic days in peacetime. The change the country has voted for could be interpreted in many ways, as there is a lot wrong with the UK right now. Waiting lists for doctors\u2019 appointments are in the millions. The cost-of-living crisis that has plagued Europe left many in Britain having to make unthinkable decisions between heating their homes or eating. Immigration, particularly irregular migration, has become a major issue for voters on the right. There are many more examples but, bluntly, there has been a sense for some time that the UK simply doesn\u2019t function well as a country. If the Brexit vote of 2016 told the British political establishment anything, it\u2019s that large parts of the nation were fed up with the status quo. If nothing else, Starmer has to make the people of Britain feel that they are living better lives with his time in office. But he must do so with some challenges, despite the size of his majority. It is no secret that he doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of public money to spend. He has loosely pledged not to raise taxes. Convincing the public that the Labour Party could be trusted with public finances was a big part of his electoral campaign. This combination of limited public money and a promise to balance the books runs into another of the key challenges facing Starmer: those in his own party who believe he should be radical. Of course, Labour members and activists are pleased to see the back of the Conservative Party after 14 long years in power. But some, especially on the left of the party, don\u2019t want to see a thumping majority squandered on moderate policy that returns right-wingers to power in five years. Their concerns may not be completely unfounded. While the story of this election is Starmer\u2019s landslide, the anti-Conservative vote split in a few different directions. Most notably, the hard-right Reform UK, led by friend of Donald Trump Nigel Farage, secured 14% of the national vote. Reform took a lot of votes from the Conservatives through vicious attacks on its record in government. It\u2019s extremely likely that with Starmer now in power, Farage and his acolytes will turn their attention to tearing chunks out of the Labour Party. If Starmer decides to stick to his moderate guns, it isn\u2019t hard to see how Reform starts labeling this Labour government as virtually the same as the Conservatives, using populist rhetoric that clearly appeals to many in Britain. On the other hand, Starmer cannot afford to spook the center-ground majority that just put him in Downing Street, having believed and trusted his message that he would be stable and responsible. Delivering meaningful change while trying to stand still is not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination. It is likely that Starmer will soon have to make some difficult decisions that will deviate in some way from his pledges made while running for office. This is normal, and most governments have to make some compromises while in power. But it will upset some of his own base. Fortunately for Starmer, he has quite a lot of political capital to spend. What he must now decide is who he spends it on.

American\u00a0brothers\u00a0Ryan Cooper and Wesley Waren found the body of Bill Stampfl on June 27 on Mount Huascaran,\u00a0according to Joseph Stampfl, Bill\u2019s son. The climbers had been descending the mountain in Peru\u2019s Cordillera Blanca after an unsuccessful attempt to reach its 22,000 ft summit when they found the body, at about 16,500 ft. Cooper told CNN Tuesday they noticed an object that didn\u2019t quite blend into the landscape and decided to investigate. He said the ice had preserved the body and its belongings and Stampfl\u2019s wedding ring, helmet, mountain climbing boots, and jacket were all intact. The brothers managed to identify Stampfl by finding a bag attached to his body, inside which they found his identification card, a camera, passport, wallet, and glasses \u2013 all of which were also intact, Cooper explained. \u201cSomeone loved him and someone wanted him to come home,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAs soon as I found out he was an American climber I knew we had a responsibility to track down the family and give them the news,\u201d Cooper said. Stampfl and two of his fellow climbers and\u00a0friends, Steve Erskine\u00a0and Matthew Richardson, were all killed by an avalanche on Mount Huascaran on June 24, 2002, his daughter Jennifer Stampfl told CNN on Tuesday. Their bodies were never discovered, except for Erskine\u2019s, she said. Stampfl was 58-years-old at the time. His body was retrieved and brought down the mountain on July 5 by the Peruvian Mountain Rescue Association and Peruvian National Police after coordination with Cooper and Stampfl\u2019s family. His body was taken to a morgue in the town of Yungay for an autopsy, Peru\u2019s National Police posted on X on Tuesday. The US State Department confirmed the death of a US citizen in Peru. \u201cWe offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss and thank the mountaineers and the Peruvian National Police rescue team who have been involved in this operation,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said, adding it was providing assistance to the family. Finding Bill\u2019s family Cooper, a native of Las Vegas, Nevada, called his wife and informed her of his discovery the same day he came across Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0body. He\u00a0asked her for help in finding Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0family, as he was still on Mount Huascaran with limited cellular service. After much online research, Cooper\u2019s wife was able to locate Joseph and called him on June 29. \u201cI told him I know the location of his dad. I told him about the ring and personal items,\u201d Cooper said. His motive was to help the family find closure, Cooper explained. With \u201cno body, there\u2019s no way to find peace with that,\u201d Cooper said. Cooper also spoke to Jennifer and Stampfl\u2019s widow Janet on the phone before sending photos of Stampfl\u2019s ID and other belongings to the family. \u2018My heart just sank\u2019 After so many years, the news came as an emotional shock to Stampfl\u2019s family. \u201cMy heart just sank. After 22 years I had been okay with the fact that he\u2019s there. He\u2019s part of the mountain. Like we\u2019re never going to get him back. The fact that they found him, it opened up all the wounds,\u201d Jennifer told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThere is no preparation for having your husband killed instantaneously,\u201d Janet said, adding that she never thought her husband\u2019s body would be discovered. \u201cIt\u2019s an answer to so many prayers by so many people.\u201d Janet said her husband loved climbing mountains. \u201cHe enjoyed it so much. He said he always felt closest to God when he got to the top of the mountain,\u201d Janet said. \u201cAfter 22 years\u2026I was a little shocked, it took me a while to process everything,\u201d Joseph said, adding \u201cnow it\u2019s time to bring him home hopefully.\u201d Following an autopsy in Yungay, Stampfl\u2019s body was transferred to the city of Juarez, Joseph explained. Stampfl will be taken to a funeral home in Lima where he will be cremated, and the ashes will be sent to the family in the United States. \u2018A dangerous landscape\u2019 While Cooper is grateful to have finally been able to bring closure to the Stampfl family, the discovery was also tinged with sadness. He had hoped that Richardson\u2019s body might have been attached to Stampfl by a rope, but that was not the case and \u201che\u2019s still missing as of today.\u201d He also fears that global warming may have played a role in his discovery, by thawing the ice on what is considered the world\u2019s highest tropical mountain range. \u201cHe was fully exposed and not in ice anymore. The thawing process happened,\u201d Cooper said. Since the 1950s, almost all of the world\u2019s glaciers have been retreating, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. On average, the glaciers in the Andean region \u2013 Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru \u2013 have lost over 50 per cent of their coverage since the 1960s. \u201cThe Andes is deteriorating more than any other mountain range in the region,\u201d Cooper said, adding that the changing conditions were part of what had prevented him from summiting Mount Huascaran. \u201cGlaciers are melting away, the landscape has changed. It poses a dangerous landscape now,\u201d he said.

Israel had previously agreed to allow Palestinians unrestricted access to northern Gaza during an eventual ceasefire, but the prime minister told his negotiating team this week to demand that armed men be barred from northern Gaza as part of any ceasefire and hostage deal, the source said. The new demand could potentially upend progress in hostage negotiations and raises further questions about Netanyahu\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s own proposal for a deal that has become the basis for detailed negotiations. Last week, a US official told CNN that a framework agreement was \u201cin place\u201d and an Israeli official said that Netanyahu had authorized\u00a0his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations, signaling a potential breakthrough. Talks resumed in the Qatari capital Doha last Friday. Over the weekend, Hamas\u00a0agreed to compromise\u00a0on a major sticking point for Israel, that the Jewish state commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement. But a\u00a0statement\u00a0by the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office on Sunday cast doubt on whether the deal would progress, laying out several \u201cprinciples\u201d Israel is not prepared to abandon, including resumed fighting in Gaza \u201cuntil all of objectives of the war have been achieved.\u201d Israel launched its war on Gaza nine months ago, in response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities.

{"id": "2024_07_10_middleeast_palestinian-patients-evacutation-gaza-war-uae-floating-hospital-mime-intl", "text": "Aged just four, Julia Abu Zeiter suffers from a rare neurological disease that can be fatal without medication. The nine-month war in Gaza nearly took Julia\u2019s life, as the fighting and displacement cut off her access to treatment. After an arduous journey, she was finally evacuated from the war-torn enclave on June 27, accompanied only by her 21-year-old aunt, Dareen Zeiter. \u201cThe displacement was really difficult, the events in Gaza are very difficult. What Julia saw was very harsh,\u201d Dareen told CNN. Julia suffers from a rare neurological disorder called alternating hemiplegia of childhood, or AHC. It causes recurrent episodes of paralysis and life-threatening seizures. No cure exists for the illness, which is estimated to occur in approximately one in a million births. Its patients are referred to as \u201chuman time bombs\u201d and need to constantly be monitored for signs of an oncoming episode. As soon as it strikes, lifesaving measures must quickly be administered. CNN met with Julia and Dareen aboard a floating hospital run by the United Arab Emirates, where they had been staying for a week after leaving Gaza through Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. The two Palestinians were among around a dozen patients leaving the floating hospital to continue their treatment in the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi. Most of those patients are children, including two suffering from Leukemia. Gaza\u2019s \u2018invisible victims\u2019 Moored off the coast of Arish on the north coast of Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, the hospital is some 40 kilometers from Rafah, the southernmost city in the Gaza strip that now lies in ruins after Israel launched its ground operation there in May. The city also housed the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a crucial land bridge through which two-thirds of aid entering Gaza passed. The crossing has been closed since it was seized by the Israeli military. The 100-bed UAE ship has received 2,400 injured Palestinians since February, according to the hospital director, Dr. Ahmed Mubarak. Julia is \u201can invisible victim\u201d of the war, Mubarak said, caught up in what M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders, described as Gaza\u2019s \u201csilent killings, the result of deliberate deprivation.\u201d The organization\u2019s head of emergency programs, Mari Carmen Vi\u00f1oles, said in May that Israel\u2019s \u201cblockades, delays, and restrictions on humanitarian aid and essential medical supplies\u201d have made aid deliveries impossible. Julia and Dareen are two of countless Palestinians displaced by the war in Gaza, which Israel launched in response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Israel\u2019s war has killed more than 38,000 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. Swathes of the enclave have been turned to rubble and almost the entire strip\u2019s population of two million is internally displaced. Julia and Dareen were forced to leave their home in northern Gaza when the war began. The four-year-old witnessed \u201cexplosions and shelling\u201d throughout, her aunt said. A punishing siege by Israel has choked the enclave, bringing humanitarian aid down to a trickle and preventing Gazans moving in and out. For Julia, this meant running out of her medication, which triggered a series of life-threatening seizures. Around a month into the war, Julia ran out of three of the five medications she was taking, Dareen told CNN. This triggered a state of paralysis for six months. With the help of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund (PCRF), a US-based non-governmental organization, Julia was able to finally evacuate through Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing, Dareen said. \u2018Hunger is what destroys us\u2019 Down the hall of makeshift wards from Julia was Ibrahim, who was injured in his family home in Jabalya, northern Gaza, when an airstrike hit their building on November 21. He had turned seven that day. Ibrahim was aboard the ship with his aunt, Alaa, 21. Alaa and Ibrahim were both injured in the airstrike, having survived after being pulled from the rubble, Alaa said. The aunt sustained critical burns, while Ibrahim broke his arm and leg, she said. The boy\u2019s injuries did not heal properly, requiring further treatment. \u201cIbrahim and I were the only two survivors,\u201d Alaa told CNN, adding that the airstrike killed 30 members of their family. They left Gaza on April 28 through the Rafah crossing, just a week before Israeli forces seized control of it. \u201cLook, this is my dad,\u201d Ibrahim said, holding up a photo of his father, who died during the airstrike, on his aunt\u2019s phone. Before losing their home and family, Alaa and Ibrahim remained in northern Gaza until April, when residents were experiencing severe hunger as aid struggled to reach them amid Israel\u2019s military operations and what humanitarian aid officials said was increased lawlessness and looting of trucks there. In mid-March, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessed that famine is \u201cimminent\u201d in northern Gaza and said it was projected to occur between then and May. On Tuesday, the United Nations, citing a report by independent experts, said that the recent deaths of more Palestinian children due to hunger and malnutrition in Gaza indicates famine has spread across the entire strip, decrying Israel\u2019s \u201cintentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people\u201d as a \u201cform of genocidal violence\u201d. \u201cThere was unbelievable hunger,\u201d Alaa told CNN, sitting on a hospital bed as Ibrahim stood by. \u201cWe lived through hunger, the main ingredients for food weren\u2019t there,\u201d Alaa told CNN. \u201cHunger was harder on us than the war itself,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThose who have died, died. But hunger is what destroys us.\u201d While Julia and Ibrahim have made it out, millions of others remain trapped in the war zone, with few signs of a ceasefire deal in sight. Nearly 26,000 children have been killed or injured in Gaza in six months, the aid group Save the Children said in April, just over 2% of Gaza\u2019s entire child population. \u201cEven amid the complexities of war, how can we not grasp one universal truth: a child is a child,\u201d UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said last month, calling for \u201ca ceasefire (that) gets hostages home, and stops the killing of children.\u201d Dareen, Julia\u2019s aunt, said the responsibility over her niece was too big to shoulder. \u201cShe needs her mother and father. I can\u2019t be her mother and father at the same time.\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAt the end of the day, I am a child that crossed with a child.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/middleeast/palestinian-patients-evacutation-gaza-war-uae-floating-hospital-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM.

After the match, Spaniard Alcaraz bravely joked with the crowd that \u201cSunday is going to be a good day for Spanish people\u201d ahead of the Wimbledon final and Euro 2024 final, in which Spain will face England, drawing loud boos. Alcaraz then held his hands together, asking for forgiveness from the crowd with a big grin on his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t say Spain is going to win!\u201d he clarified. \u201cI just said it\u2019s going to be a fun day.\u201d Still only 21 years old, Alcaraz is now into the fourth grand slam final of his career. He was well below his blistering best at times during the near three-hour win over Medvedev, but it always seemed as though the man from Murcia had another gear to find if needed. That is now 13 straight wins at Wimbledon for Alcaraz and 13 straight grand slam victories after winning the French Open last month. Alcaraz is now a remarkable 17-1 in grand slams this year, with his only loss so far coming against Alex Zverev in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. In what has been one of the wetter Wimbledon fortnights, Alcaraz has been playing his matches on Centre Court under the roof and he said he was \u201cglad to play outdoors\u201d on a slightly sunnier Friday afternoon. \u201cDifferent conditions but really happy with my performance,\u201d he said in his post-match interview. \u201cI started really nervous, he was dominating the match, playing great tennis with his serve, his return game. It was difficult for me. \u201cI tried to pull out all the nerves at the beginning of the second set, it was helpful to be up 3-1 and after I could play my own game. I could enjoy the match a bit more. I hit great shots, moved well. I played a good match. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not new anymore, I know how I\u2019m going to feel before the final. I\u2019ve been in this position before. I will try to do the things I did well last year and try to be better and try to do the things that went well.\u201d Alcaraz, who is bidding to become only the sixth man to win Wimbledon and the French Open in the same season \u2013 known as the \u2018Channel Slam\u2019 \u2013 won last year\u2019s title after a five-set epic against Novak Djokovic, who he could meet in the final once again.

{"id": "2024_07_11_middleeast_israel-hostage-andrey-kozlov-gaza-hamas-intl", "text": "When the Gaza sunshine was at its hottest, Andrey Kozlov said the Hamas fighters would cover him with blankets, leaving him to stew in his sweat. When he asked about his family, they would say they had forgotten him. When they pulled the blindfold from his eyes, they said they would kill him and film his murder. The 27-year-old said he suffered intense psychological \u2013 and some physical \u2013 abuse at the hands of Hamas. He cannot bring himself to describe all that happened to him and the two other hostages he was kept with during his eight months of captivity in Gaza. After being snatched from the Nova music festival on October 7, Kozlov, a Russian-Israeli citizen, said he was tied up for \u201cthree days with rope, then until the middle of December with chains.\u201d During these months he was subjected to \u201ccreative\u201d forms of punishment: One guard \u201ctold us a lot that Israel wants to kill us\u201d and that they were a problem from which Israel was trying to rid itself. Kozlov strove not to believe the lies, he said, but the result was that, when Israeli soldiers last month burst into the building in which he was being held, he thought they had been sent to kill him. Instead, it was a stunning rescue operation that brought him and the two others home \u2013 as well as Noa Argamani, who was held in a nearby building. But it left in its wake a trail of destruction: Gaza authorities say at least 274 Palestinians were killed in the raid and the ensuing firefight with Hamas militants. In an interview with CNN, Kozlov detailed his months of captivity in Gaza, the psychological torture he weathered, the threats he faced, and his desire for Israel and Hamas to strike a deal to release the remaining hostages. Kozlov was nearing the end of his shift as a security guard at the Nova festival when Hamas fighters began to pour over the border. He had moved from Russia to Israel two years earlier, and taken the job because it was \u201ceasy money.\u201d When he clocked off, Kozlov thought \u201cI will come back home, I will sleep and everything will be good. But no, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Minutes later, he was sprinting through a forest with \u201cmaybe 200, 300 people,\u201d panicked by the sound of gunshots and a stream of gruesome nearby videos that had already emerged online. But as they stumbled out into a field, Kozlov saw \u2013 he recalled in broken English \u2013 \u201ca car full of guys in green uniform. And they shoot in the air, they shoot already on us.\u201d Hiding in the bushes was no help. He was swiftly found and taken to Gaza, where he was held in several different places with Almog Meir Jan and Shlomi Ziv, before their eventual rescue in Nuseirat, in the center of the enclave. On his first day, his captor \u201ctook the fabric from my eyes and showed me with signs\u201d what he was planning to do. The man pointed to himself \u2013 \u201cI\u201d \u2013 then tapped his watch \u2013 \u201ctomorrow\u201d \u2013 then pointed to Kozlov \u2013 \u201cyou\u201d \u2013 then made a camera sign, clicking its shutter \u2013 \u201cfilm\u201d \u2013 then made a gun with his fingers, pulling the trigger \u2013 \u201ckill.\u201d Kozlov said he thought that day would be his last, but \u2013 as the hours passed \u2013 that fear slowly subsided. Days later, he said he understood \u201cthat probably they\u2019re not gonna kill us.\u201d Using signs again, they explained to Kozlov that they wanted to swap him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to Israel, our people go to Gaza and the West Bank.\u201d For the first three months, the sound of Israeli bombing was constant, Kozlov said: \u201cWe were afraid of every bomb that we heard. Every time you started to hide in the corners of our room.\u201d His captors laughed, he said, asking what they were afraid of. They were moved between houses several times, Kozlov said, with some places giving them enough food. After being unchained in December, some places where he was held gave him the chance to exercise \u2013 \u201csquats, pushups\u201d and the like. But he was exposed to prolonged psychological abuse, he said, by guards watching over them wearing masks, holding Kalashnikovs and a \u201cbig knife.\u201d The main guard, he said, had a \u201csplit\u201d personality and often \u201cgot crazy.\u201d \u201cHe has two personalities,\u201d Kozlov said. \u201cHe told us: \u2018I have two faces: A good one, but I don\u2019t want you to see the second face \u2013 like, I can kill you.\u2019\u201d Some mornings, the guard would be friendly, offering to play cards with them. But in other mornings Kozlov would \u201cwake up and you understand \u2013 ah, the second face. You don\u2019t talk with him at all.\u201d Kozlov would be punished for arbitrary things, he said. Once, after washing his hands with drinking water before eating, the guard \u201cnoticed and he said, \u2018I told you not to do this, yes?\u2019\u201d The guard had someone cover Kozlov with \u201creally thick blankets, in the middle of May,\u201d and leave him in the heat for an hour and a half. Kozlov\u2019s testimony chimes with that of other rescued hostages. The doctor in charge of medical treatment for Kozlov and the three others rescued in the Israeli operation said they were beaten and described their captivity as a \u201charsh, harsh experience, with a lot of abuse, almost every day.\u201d \u201cThere have been periods where they got almost no food whatsoever, there were other periods where it was a little better, but all in all, the combination of the psychological stress, malnutrition or not getting enough food\u2026 have a significant effect on health,\u201d Dr. Itai Pessach told CNN last month. Still, Kozlov considers himself \u201clucky.\u201d He said he saw other hostages during his eight months in Gaza, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2026 It\u2019s painful and it\u2019s gonna be dangerous for them,\u201d he said. Were they in worse shape than him? \u201cYes they were.\u201d For that reason, Kozlov implored Israeli officials to \u201ctry to understand how we (the hostages) felt all this time. We need to bring them home as soon as possible. I don\u2019t know how. But we need to do this immediately.\u201d Optimism about a ceasefire-for-hostages deal has waned this week, however, as Hamas warned that Israeli actions in Gaza could jeopardize the talks. Last week, a US official told CNN that a framework agreement is \u201cin place\u201d and an Israeli official said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations, signaling a potential breakthrough. Talks resumed in the Qatari capital Doha last Friday. Over the weekend, Hamas agreed to compromise on a major sticking point for Israel \u2013 that Netanyahu\u2019s government commits to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement. But a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office on Sunday cast doubt on the deal, laying out several \u201cprinciples\u201d Israel is not prepared to abandon, including resumed fighting in Gaza \u201cuntil all objectives of the war have been achieved.\u201d For Kozlov, the days he was captured \u2013 and rescued \u2013 have become landmarks in his life. October 7 became his second \u201cbirthday;\u201d June 8, his third. He wants the 120 remaining hostages to be able to mark their own dates.

{"id": "2024_07_10_middleeast_idf-evacuation-gaza-city-intl-latam", "text": "The Israeli military expanded its evacuation order to the whole of Gaza City on Wednesday after sending tens of thousands of Palestinians fleeing from several of the city\u2019s neighborhoods earlier this week. It also issued a notice saying it will be suspending inspections along two roads in Gaza City, in the north of the Gaza Strip, to allow civilians to reach humanitarian zones more easily and quickly as the city \u201cwill remain a dangerous combat zone.\u201d \u201cWe announce to you that Tariq Bin Ziyad and Omar Al-Mukhtar Streets are considered safe passages to cross west to Al-Rashid (Al-Bahr) Street and from there south. Al-Wahda and Khalil Al-Wazir streets are considered safe passages to cross east to the Al-Zaytoun neighborhood and the city roundabout, and from there to Salah Al-Din Street to the south,\u201d an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) flier dropped on the city said. Gaza City experienced shelling overnight on Wednesday. A local journalist told CNN the building he was sheltering in had been struck, forcing him to move with his family once more. Bakeries \u2018completely closed\u2019 Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Bassal told CNN he was aware of dozens of deaths in the industrial zone, east of Gaza City, and the financial hub in the center. Bassal added that several Palestinians are besieged in the Jordanian hospital and at Al-Aqsa University in the city, as the situation remains dangerous. \u201cToday, suddenly, all bakeries in Gaza are completely closed. It seems that there are instructions for them to do so, or that they fall in the red zone,\u201d he added. Charity group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said on Wednesday that it was forced to shut its last health facility in northern Gaza after Israel\u2019s evacuation order. \u201cTeams continued to provide patient care until the last minute, before fleeing the area that came under heavy fire,\u201d MSF said on X.  Residents could be seen walking down Salah Al-Din Street from northern Gaza with their belongings. Some held white flags made of sticks and white shirts. Baraa, a young man pushing a bicycle, said he was staying alone with his brother in northern Gaza, but \u201cthe situation became very difficult, there is no food.\u201d A woman from Shajaiya, one of Gaza City\u2019s biggest neighborhoods, said the area had come under persistent shelling, adding that she saw many people dead in the streets. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned the directive for residents to leave Gaza City threatened to intensify the plight of already displaced communities. The IDF has been issuing evacuation orders affecting large parts of Gaza City since Sunday, urging 250,000 residents to head to \u201csafe zones\u201d further south, in Deir al-Balah and al-Zawaida. The IDF has said that evacuation orders are necessary so that civilians don\u2019t get caught up in its renewed operations in areas where Hamas is seeking to re-establish a presence. The IDF insists it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Hamas has said the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d \u201cEvery day they would tell us to evacuate and we are displaced from one place to another while quadcaptors are shooting at us,\u201d Mahmoud Al Shaqra, a resident of Gaza City, told CNN as he evacuated southwards. \u201cGaza City is completely destroyed, it is unlivable,\u201d Al Sharqa said. \u201cThere is no food or drink or anything here.

{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_france-second-round-parliament-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Voters are turning out in high numbers across France to vote in the second round of a snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron, who risks losing swaths of his centrist allies in parliament and being forced to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with the far right. According to data published by the French Interior Ministry, 59.71% of French voters cast their vote by 5 p.m. Sunday (11 a.m. ET) - a level unseen since 1981. It marks a 20-point increase compared to the same time in 2022. After taking the lead in the first round of voting last Sunday, the far-right National Rally (RN) \u2013 led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella under the watchful eye of party doyenne Marine Le Pen \u2013 is closer to power than ever before. The RN, whose once-taboo brand of anti-immigrant politics has been given a fresh and more acceptable face by Bardella, won 33% of the popular vote in the first round. The newly-formed left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), came second with 28%, while Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance trailed in a distant third with 21%. But the prospect of a far-right government \u2013 which would be France\u2019s first since the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II \u2013 has spurred Ensemble and the NFP into action. After a week of political bargaining, hundreds of candidates stood down in particular seats to try to deny the RN an absolute majority. Voting began at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), as France began the process of electing the 577 members of its National Assembly, in which 289 seats are needed for a party to hold an absolute majority. In the outgoing parliament, Macron\u2019s alliance had only 250 seats, and so needed support from other parties to pass laws. Only those who win more than 12.5% of the votes of registered votes in the first round can stand in the second, meaning it is often fought between two candidates. But this time a record number of seats \u2013 more than 300 \u2013 produced a three-way run-off, in a measure of France\u2019s polarization. In an attempt not to split the anti-far right vote, more than 200 candidates from Macron\u2019s alliance and the NFP agreed to stand down in the second round. While RN\u2019s strong showing in the first round means it could more than triple the 88 seats it had in the outgoing parliament, it is not clear if it will be able to reach an absolute majority. Although it is customary for the president to appoint a prime minister from the largest party, Bardella has repeatedly said he will refuse to form a minority government. In that case, Macron might have to search for a prime minister on the hard left or, to form a technocratic government, somewhere else entirely. Whatever the result of Sunday\u2019s vote, France seems set to endure a period of political chaos, with Macron unable to call another parliamentary election for at least a year. The campaign has already been marred with violence. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Friday that 51 candidates and campaigners had been assaulted on the campaign trail, leading to some being hospitalized. The vote is being held three years earlier than necessary. France was not due to hold parliamentary elections until 2027, but Macron called the snap vote \u2013 the first time a French leader has done so since 1997 \u2013 after his party was trounced by the RN at last month\u2019s European Parliament elections. Although the European election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. Some have argued that, with the possibility of the RN winning both the presidency and the parliament in 2027, Macron was keen to expose it to government beforehand, in the hope that it would lose its appeal once in office. If the RN refuses to form a minority government, Macron\u2019s gamble could backfire. An RN-led government would have huge implications for France and the rest of Europe. Its spending plans \u2013 which include cutting value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products \u2013 have alarmed financial markets and could put France on a collision course with Brussels\u2019 restrictive spending laws. On the continental stage, an RN-led government would further Europe\u2019s rightward shift, at a time when the center is trying to remain united on issues like support for Ukraine, migration and climate change. Standing between the RN and an absolute majority is the NFP, comprising more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, a three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique\u2019s Raphael Gluckmann. While Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies said they will do everything in their power to stop the RN coming to power, it has refused to collaborate with or endorse candidates from France Unbowed. Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege and the outgoing prime minister, has vowed never to enter into alliance with Melenchon. Polls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-second-round-parliament-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_07_11_weather_us-deadly-heat-summer-climate", "text": "A historically hot summer in the United States is on a July killing spree and the toll will only grow with the hottest days yet to come. It\u2019s been the hottest summer on record to date for around 100 US cities from Maine to California. Heat is suspected in the deaths of least 37 people in the US in July, a number that is likely underestimated given the amount of time it takes to attribute a death to nature\u2019s most prolific weather killer. Many of the deaths have been in the West, where cities have shattered all-time record high temperatures during an unprecedented and long heat wave \u2013 exactly the kind of conditions scientists expect in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Heat is being investigated in the deaths of at least 19 people in Santa Clara County, California, alone, the county\u2019s medical examiner office told CNN. Everyone is vulnerable to heat, but some are more at risk than others. Children, the elderly, pregnant people, people with heart or blood pressure issues, outdoor workers or anyone without access to reliable cooling are more likely to succumb to heat-related illnesses than others. At least three of the people who may have succumbed to heat in Santa Clara County were unhoused without adequate access to cooling. Nine were over the age of 65, the county medical examiner told CNN. At least one person died from heat in Southeast Texas, where more than 1 million people are still without power for the fourth day after Hurricane Beryl. Others have died or been sickened trying to keep cool improperly using generators. At least four children \u2013 a 2-year-old in Arizona; a 2-year-old in Georgia; a 4-year-old in Texas; a 5-year-old in Nebraska \u2013 died after being left in cars during this month\u2019s heat. Another child \u2013 a 10-year-old \u2013 died of a \u201cheat-related medical event\u201d while hiking in a Phoenix park amid searing heat last week, according to the Phoenix Police Department. Phoenix has broken or tied multiple daily heat records since the start of July. High temperatures have climbed above 110 degrees and lows have failed to fall below 90 in the city each day since last Tuesday. Dozens of other deaths are being investigated by Phoenix\u2019s Maricopa County for potential heat-related causes. At least 10 suspected heat deaths are being reported in Oregon. At least six have been in Portland\u2019s Multnomah County. Portland smashed daily high records for at least five consecutive days in the past week, rising into the triple digits on three occasions. The heat has also taken a toll on recreationalists attempting to enjoy the outdoors in hostile weather. A motorcyclist died from heat exposure in Death Valley on Saturday. The high temperature topped out at 128 degrees, setting a daily record and coming within six degrees of the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth. A 50-year-old man also died while hiking on Sunday amid extreme heat in Grand Canyon National Park, the National Park Service confirmed. Some of these deaths are still under investigation, since confirming heat as a cause of death has always been \u201ca complicated process,\u201d David S. Jones, a physician and historian at Harvard University, previously told CNN. A medical examiner or coroner must list a single cause of death, and in some places, those officials are political appointees or elected officials who may not have any kind of medical background. \u201cThe (cause of death) assessment itself is a complicated one,\u201d Jones added. \u201cIf someone is found deceased in an apartment, and you\u2019re trying to figure out what was the top cause of death to list, many medical examiners will say, \u2018well, the person must have died of heart disease in some way because their heart stopped.\u2019\u201d Heat-related deaths will likely rise in the coming weeks as more are confirmed and temperatures stay high. The extreme nature of the heat in the West will start to ease late this weekend, starting a slow return to near- or slightly above-normal summer heat.

Heat will be a consistent companion over much of the US with hotter than average temperatures likely through the end of July and into at least early August, according to the Climate Prediction Center.

{"id": "2024_07_06_americas_argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam", "text": "It was an attack that sent shockwaves through a country long considered a pioneer in LGBTQ rights. In the early hours of May 6, four lesbian women were set on fire\u00a0in Argentina. Only one of them survived. It happened at a\u00a0boarding house\u00a0in the Barracas neighborhood of Buenos Aires, where Pamela Fabiana Cobas, Mercedes Roxana Figueroa, Andrea Amarante and Sof\u00eda Castro Riglo were sharing a room. Witnesses say a man\u00a0broke in\u00a0and threw an incendiary device that set the women on fire. Pamela died soon after. Her partner Roxana died days later of organ failure. Andrea died on May 12 in a hospital. Andrea\u2019s\u00a0partner Sof\u00eda was the sole survivor. She spent weeks recovering in hospital and is alive today only because Andrea threw herself on top of her to shield her from the flames, Sofia\u2019s attorney Gabriela Conder told CNN. \u201cHer partner saved her,\u201d Conder said. Local LGBTQ rights advocates condemned the attack as a hate crime and lesbicide, saying the women were targeted because of their sexual identity. Police have arrested a 62-year-old man who\u00a0lived in the building but, according to Conder, aren\u2019t currently treating the incident as a hate crime as they say the motive is still unclear. For Argentina\u2019s LGBTQ groups \u2013 many of whom are planning to commemorate the four women with a rally this weekend \u2013 the attack represents an extreme manifestation of what they consider a growing wave of hostility against them. Those they blame most for this rising intolerance are the people in power. Chief among them, they say, is the country\u2019s new far-right leader Javier Milei. \u201cThings changed with the new government of Javier Milei,\u201d said Maria Rachid, head of the Institute Against Discrimination of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in Buenos Aires, and a board member and founder of the Argentine LGBT Federation (FALGBT). \u201cSince the beginning of the new government, there are national government officials expressing themselves in a discriminatory manner and those hate speeches before our communities from places with so much power, of course, what they do is generate \u2013 actually legitimize \u2013 and endorse these discriminatory positions that are then expressed with violence and discrimination in everyday life,\u201d Rachid said. Milei under fire When Milei ran for president\u00a0in 2023, he and his party\u00a0were accused of making offensive remarks against LGBTQ communities which were deemed hate speech by multiple groups, including Argentina\u2019s National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes. In a YouTube interview ahead of the November election, Milei insisted that he does\u00a0not oppose same-sex marriage, but in that same interview, he went on to compare homosexuality to having sex with animals. \u201cWhat do I care what your sexual preference is? If you want to be with an elephant, and you have the consent of that elephant, that\u2019s a problem between you and the elephant,\u201d he said, angering LGBTQ communities, who called the comments dehumanizing. In late October, then-congresswoman-elect Diana Mondino, who would later become Milei\u2019s foreign minister, told an interviewer that she supports marriage equality in theory, but at the same time,\u00a0compared it to having lice. \u201cAs a\u00a0liberal, I\u2019m in favor of each person\u2019s life project. It is much broader than marriage equality. Let me exaggerate: If you prefer not to bathe and be full of lice and it is your choice, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t complain later if there is someone who doesn\u2019t like that you have lice,\u201d she said. After\u00a0taking office in December, Milei took steps that\u00a0critics say weakened protections for LGBTQ groups. He banned\u00a0the use of\u00a0gender-inclusive language\u00a0in government; replaced the\u00a0Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity\u00a0with a less powerful undersecretariat within the Ministry of Human Capital; and effectively closed the national anti-discrimination agency, saying the Ministry of Justice would\u00a0absorb its functions. Milei\u2019s administration argued that some of those moves were part of his plan to cut public spending in response to the country\u2019s economic hardships. But critics say his actions have normalized a culture of discrimination toward LGBTQ groups, and in the most extreme cases, have led to violent attacks such as the deadly May 6 arson. \u201cWhen hate speech is enabled by those in power, these sectors start to feel legitimized to attack,\u201d Esteban Paul\u00f3n, a former FALGBT president who was elected to Congress last year, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cAnd obviously, behind the verbal attacks come physical attacks.\u201d \u201c(Attacks) always happened. That\u2019s the reality. But they increased more in this current government due to the hate speeches constantly maintained on television, including hate speeches that our president Javier Milei exerts,\u201d said Jesi Hern\u00e1ndez, a lesbian and communication member of Lesbianxs Autoconvocadxs por la masacre de Barracas (Self-convened Lesbians for the Barracas massacre). \u201cToday it was Pamela, Roxana, Andrea and Sof\u00eda. And tomorrow it can be me.\u201d CNN\u00a0has repeatedly reached out to the presidency for comment on these allegations but has not received a response. Rise in hate crimes In 2023, an annual report by the National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes recorded\u00a0133 crimes\u00a0in which the victims\u2019 sexual orientation, identity and/or gender expression were used as a pretext for the attacks. Those numbers rose from 2022 and 2021, when 129 and 120 crimes were recorded, respectively. Rachid points out that the observatory\u2019s numbers only represent attacks that have been officially recorded, and that the real figures are likely much higher. Hern\u00e1ndez, meanwhile, notes that daily life for many people has been impacted in ways not shown by statistics alone. Some now fear they could be targeted next. \u201cThe\u00a0truth is that now, sleeping peacefully in your bed is a privilege,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said, referencing the May 6 attack, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know if you have a neighbor who will throw something at you or come in. Sleeping is now a privilege for us.\u201d Despite calls from LGBTQ activists, the arson is currently being investigated as an aggravated homicide rather than a hate crime, according to Conder, Sofia\u2019s attorney. Sofia is set to testify at the end of the month, Conder\u00a0said. CNN has reached out to the criminal court investigating the case but has not received a response. Shortly after the May 6 killings, the presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni condemned the attack but\u00a0dismissed\u00a0the notion that it was motivated by hatred toward the sexual orientation of the victims. \u201cI don\u2019t like to define it as an attack on a certain group,\u201d Adorni said at a press conference. \u201cThere are many women and men who are suffering violence and these are things that cannot continue to happen.\u201d Progressives condemned his remarks, insisting that the government should regard lesbicide as a hate crime. Adorni responded on social media with a picture of a Spanish dictionary that said\u00a0lesbicide\u00a0is not a registered word. Progress in Argentina Argentina was once a progressive pioneer in\u00a0Latin America. In 2010, it became the first country in the region to\u00a0legalize same-sex marriage. In 2021, it also became the first to allow nonbinary people to mark their gender as \u201cX\u201d on\u00a0national identity documents. LGBTQ activists fear these historic gains are now being undermined \u2013 and potentially threatened \u2013 by the current government.\u00a0But they also take comfort in surveys that suggest anti-LGBTQ views are the minority in Argentina. According to a public opinion survey conducted in May by the University of San Andr\u00e9s, some 72% of respondents said they are in favor of marriage equality, 70% said they support policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, 75% said they do not consider that transsexuality is a disease that should be treated medically, and 79% said that comprehensive sexuality education in schools is a positive thing. The recent attacks have galvanized activists to fight for new policies and actions that would further protect LGBTQ rights. Congressman Paul\u00f3n told CNN that lawmakers are working with rights groups on various laws that would, among other things, punish discriminatory acts, prevent harassment in schools, and ban efforts to try to \u201ccorrect\u201d people\u2019s sexual orientation, identity and gender. He also said that to reduce attacks on LGBTQ communities, their voices and demands should be amplified in more societal sectors. To that end, Hern\u00e1ndez encouraged LGBTQ groups to push back against hate speech, telling those communities: \u201cThey are not insane, they are not sick, they are not people with lice. Quite the opposite. I would tell them that they are a disruptive person, that they are breaking out of the molds of \u2018normality.\u2019 And that they are very brave \u2026 and that they are whatever they want to be, despite all this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/americas/argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_north-korea-summer-camp-intl-hnk", "text": "Even for locals, travel inside the isolated nation officially known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is heavily restricted. But arranging a trip was much easier for Russian national Yuri Frolov, 25, who spent two weeks in the hermit kingdom as a high-school student in 2015 and 2016.\u00a0Yuri\u2019s fascination with North Korea began with a TV documentary that portrayed the country as besieged by capitalist neighbors. This curiosity led him to join a \u201cSolidarity with North Korea\u201d group on VKontakte, Russia\u2019s Facebook equivalent. Through this group, he found an opportunity to attend Songdowon International Children\u2019s Camp in Wonsan, on North Korea\u2019s east coast. About $500 covered all expenses for a 15-day trip. His parents consented, and he traveled alone from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok, joining other children and Communist Party officials on the journey. Earlier this year, 100 Russian nationals were the first tour group allowed to visit North Korea since the pandemic, a sign of Russia\u2019s increasing popularity as Pyongyang deepens ties with Moscow. Before the pandemic, the largest source of inbound tourists to North Korea wasn\u2019t Russia \u2013 it was China. Upon his arrival at Songdowon International Children\u2019s Camp in summer 2015, the camp staff greeted Frolov and his group warmly. The camp hosted children from various countries, including Laos, Nigeria, Tanzania and China. However, interactions with North Korean kids were limited to the final day, a deliberate move to prevent any exchange of real experiences. The camp offered typical summer activities like beach outings and sandcastle-building competitions but also included peculiar rituals. Campers were required to wake at 6 a.m. and clean statues of former North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, even though professionals already maintained the monuments. Having reported from North Korea 19 times, I find Frolov\u2019s experiences both relatable and eye-opening. The heavy emphasis on propaganda, the strict supervision, and the bizarre mix of freedom and control are aspects I\u2019ve encountered repeatedly. One of the more bizarre activities at the summer camp involved a computer game where players, as a hamster in a tank, had to destroy the White House. This game reminded me of an exchange I had with two North Korean campers playing a similar game. When I asked who they were shooting, they responded, \u201cOur sworn enemy, Americans.\u201d I then asked, \u201cWhat if I told you I\u2019m an American? Do you want to shoot me too?\u201d Without hesitation, they replied, \u201cYes.\u201d After reassuring the youngsters I was a \u201cgood American,\u201d they decided I should be allowed to live. And then they smiled and waved as we said goodbye. This is the paradox of North Korea. People were usually friendly and polite, even as they told me the United States should \u201cdrown in a sea of fire.\u201d Despite the heavy propaganda, Frolov remained skeptical. The strict schedule frustrated him, especially when he wasn\u2019t allowed to skip early-morning exercise despite being sick. The camp\u2019s food was another challenge, with Frolov saying he mostly subsisted on rice, potato wedges and bread, leading to an 11-pound weight loss over the 15 days. His craving for familiar food was so intense that upon returning home, he bought a feast from Burger King, though he couldn\u2019t finish it all. Frolov recounted a memorable incident in Pyongyang: \u201cThere was a girl, very young, wearing a dress styled like the American flag in the city center. Surprisingly, no one was angry with her, even though she was told not to wear it again. It was a bizarre moment in such a controlled environment.\u201d \u201cMany things seemed fake, especially the science and innovation buildings. They were not convincing, even for a kid,\u201d he reflected. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a totally awful experience. I was mostly just bored. Apart from the lack of internet, it felt like any basic Russian camp for children.\u201d Despite the unpleasant and tightly controlled environment, he opted to return to the camp the following year, partly due to the Communist Party\u2019s arrangements and what he describes as his aversion to confrontation. In hindsight, Frolov acknowledges the decision as foolish but appreciates the unique stories he can share about North Korea. His account offers a rare glimpse into the experiences of foreign children at a North Korean summer camp, highlighting the country\u2019s efforts to indoctrinate young minds through a mix of cultural exchange and propaganda. Yuri Frolov\u2019s story is a powerful reminder of the lengths to which North Korea will go to shape perceptions and cultivate loyalty. His experiences at Songdowon International Children\u2019s Camp highlight the regime\u2019s use of propaganda and control to influence young minds, a strategy I\u2019ve observed firsthand during my reporting trips. Despite the stark differences in our roles \u2013 him as a camper and me as a journalist \u2013 our experiences reveal the same underlying truth about North Korea\u2019s relentless pursuit of ideological control.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/north-korea-summer-camp-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_europe_finland-law-block-migrants-russia-intl", "text": "Finland\u2019s parliament passed a law on Friday granting border guards the power to block asylum seekers crossing from Russia, after more than 1,300 people arrived in the country, forcing Helsinki to close its border. Finland has accused neighboring Russia of weaponizing migration by encouraging scores of migrants from countries such as Syria and Somalia to cross the border, an assertion the Kremlin denies. Helsinki believes Moscow is promoting the crossings in retaliation for Finland joining NATO, which backs Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion. The right-wing government of Prime Minister Petteri Orpo has said the bill is vital to stop future arrivals, despite the law being at odds with Finland\u2019s international human rights commitments. \u201cThis is a strong message to Russia, a strong message to our allies, that Finland takes care of its own security, we take care of the security of the EU border,\u201d Orpo told a press conference after the vote. More than 1,300 asylum seekers crossed over from Russia since last summer but there had been no new arrivals since March until Thursday. The Finnish Border Guard released a statement after the parliament vote saying one person had crossed the border illegally on Thursday and when caught by a border guard, applied for asylum. Finland shut its land borders with Russia late last year. Interior Minister Mari Rantanen told the press conference after the bill passed that no decision had been taken on when to re-open the border crossings with Russia. Finland\u2019s move is similar to steps taken in recent years in other European countries, including Poland and Lithuania, to make it more difficult for migrants to cross the border from Russia and Russia-ally Belarus. The Finnish bill was passed with 167 votes in favor, 31 against and one abstention. To pass, the proposal needed a two-thirds majority of given votes in the 200-seat parliament. Orpo urged migrants who were considering coming to Europe through Russia not to embark on the journey. \u201cDon\u2019t go with the smugglers,\u201d he told the news conference. \u201cFinland takes care of its borders. The access to the borders orchestrated by Russia will not lead to access to Finland or Europe.\u201d Moscow has denied such an intention.

{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_france-election-second-round-result-intl", "text": "A left-wing alliance has won the most seats in the French parliament after tactical voting in Sunday\u2019s second round election thwarted Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party, but France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority. In a surprise result, the New Popular Front (NFP) \u2013 a cluster of several parties ranging from the far-left France Unbowed party to the more moderate Socialists and the Ecologists \u2013 won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group but short of the 289 required for an absolute majority, according to the French Interior Ministry. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which had slumped to a dismal third in the first round of voting last Sunday, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. Despite leading after the first round of votes, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party and its allies won 143 seats. The RN\u2019s strong showing in the first round stirred fears that France could be on the cusp of electing its first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But Sunday\u2019s results come as a huge upset and show French voters\u2019 overwhelming desire to keep the far right from gaining power \u2013 even at the cost of a hung parliament. After the first round, an unprecedented number of seats \u2013 over 300 \u2013 went to a three-way runoff between Ensemble, the NFP and the RN. By Tuesday, more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates withdrew from the second round, in a bid to avoid splitting the vote. Cheers rang out on the streets of Paris as the projection was published. Speaking to a crowd of his ecstatic supporters near Stalingrad square, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the firebrand leader of France Unbowed, said the results came as a \u201chuge relief for the overwhelming majority of people in our country.\u201d \u201cOur people have clearly rejected the worst-case scenario,\u201d M\u00e9lenchon said. \u201cA magnificent surge of civic mobilization has taken hold!\u201d Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege, announced he would resign as prime minister Monday morning. He seemed to take a swipe at Macron\u2019s decision to call the snap vote, saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t choose\u201d for France\u2019s parliament to be dissolved. Elsewhere in Paris, the buoyant atmosphere at a RN campaign event in Bois de Vincennes took a nosedive an hour before the polls closed. After the projection was announced, Jordan Bardella, the party\u2019s 28-year-old leader, said France had been thrown into \u201cuncertainty and instability.\u201d Handpicked as leader by Marine Le Pen in an effort to purge the party of its racist and antisemitic roots, Bardella had taken the party closer to the gates of power than ever before. Visibly disappointed by the results, he slammed the NFP as an \u201calliance of dishonor.\u201d \u201cAs from tomorrow, our deputies will take up their places to make sure we counter the migration policies and other policies of the far left. We will not enter into any kind of coalition or compromise, we will be the side of the French people,\u201d he said. A hastily assembled coalition In a brief statement, the Elysee said Macron is awaiting the full results of all 577 constituencies \u201cbefore taking the necessary decisions.\u201d \u201cIn his role as guarantor of our institutions, the president will ensure that the sovereign choice of the French people is respected,\u201d it said. After parliamentary elections, the French president appoints a prime minister from the party that won the most seats. Ordinarily, this means a candidate from the president\u2019s own party. However, Sunday\u2019s results mean Macron faces the prospect of having to appoint a figure from the left-wing coalition, in a rare arrangement known as a \u201ccohabitation.\u201d Speaking to supporters near Stalingrad square, M\u00e9lenchon said Macron \u201chas the duty to call the New Popular Front to govern.\u201d But it is not clear from which party within the coalition that Macron will appoint a prime minister. France Unbowed won 74 seats, making it the largest single party within the NFP, ahead of the Socialists with 59. But Macron and his allies had repeatedly stressed that they would refuse to enter into coalition with M\u00e9lenchon. Speaking after last Sunday\u2019s first round, outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal \u2013 Macron\u2019s protege, said France Unbowed was preventing the formation of a \u201ccredible alternative\u201d to the far right. The NFP formed less than a month ago, after Macron called the snap vote following his party\u2019s disastrous loss to the RN in last month\u2019s European Parliament election. The capacious \u2013 and potentially fractious \u2013 coalition chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. Sunday\u2019s results mean the NFP has managed to do this again. It campaigned on a platform to raise the minimum monthly wage to 1,600 euros (more than $1,700), to cap the price of essential foods, electricity, fuel and gas, and to scrap Macron\u2019s deeply unpopular pension reform, which raised the French retirement age \u2013 already one of the lowest in the Western world \u2013 from 62 to 64. A mess of Macron\u2019s making? Sunday\u2019s vote represents a victory for the French \u201ccordon sanitaire,\u201d the principle that mainstream parties must unite to block the far right from taking office. But the RN\u2019s success should not be underestimated. In the 2017 elections, when Macron swept to power, the RN won just eight seats. In 2022, it surged to 89 seats. In Sunday\u2019s vote, it won 125 \u2013 making it the largest individual party in parliament. While the risk of a far-right government has been avoided for now, these elections have plunged France into political uncertainty. Macron called the election three years earlier than necessary, just minutes after his party was trounced by the far right in the EU election. Although EU election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. But Sunday\u2019s results may further muddy the French political picture. Unable to call a new election for at least another year, and with three years left on his presidential term, Macron looks set to preside over an unruly parliament, as problems mount at home and abroad. \u00c9douard Philippe, France\u2019s former prime minister and an ally of Macron, said Macron\u2019s gamble had further complicated the situation. \u201cThe truth is that none of the political blocs in the assembly has a majority on its own to govern. The dissolution of the assembly, which was intended as a clarification, has instead led to great vagueness,\u201d he said Sunday evening. \u201cThe central political forces therefore have a responsibility to stay. They must, without compromise, promote the creation of an agreement that will stabilize the political situation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-election-second-round-result-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_style_anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-mumbai-intl-hnk", "text": "After seven months of extravagant pre-wedding celebrations, Anant Ambani, the son of India\u2019s richest man, completed his long-awaited marriage to pharmaceutical heiress Radhika Merchant before thousands of guests on Friday. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra and former British prime minister Tony Blair were just some of the famous faces who flew in to Mumbai to attend the star-studded event. The wedding also attracted many of the biggest names in Indian entertainment, sport, business and politics, from Bollywood stars like Rajinikanth and Sanjay Dutt, to former president Ram Nath Kovind, the chief ministers of various states and numerous members of the country\u2019s revered cricket team. No expense was spared by the Ambanis, the family behind India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. In a rain-soaked Mumbai, police closed roads in the area surrounding the Ambani-owned, 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Center ahead of a red-carpet-style arrival event. Attendees dressed the part, streaming past photographers in custom sarees, lehengas and kurtas at an event that may set forthcoming trends in Indian wedding fashion. International guests also honored the traditional dress code, with many seen wearing designs by major Indian fashion designers. John Cena walked the red carpet in an embroidered sky blue sherwani and white pants, while Jonas sparkled in a\u00a0baby pink version \u2014 made from a boucl\u00e9-style woven fabric embedded with sequins\u00a0\u2014 and matching satin trousers. Jonas arrived with his wife and actor, Priyanka Chopra, who opted for an intricately embellished sunshine yellow sari. The fashion crowd were out in full force too. Zendaya\u2019s longtime stylist Law Roach arrived in a mauve velvet jacket, purple tunic and a pair of Schiaparelli gold toed shoes, while designer and New York Fashion Week staple Prabal Gurung wore a rose-colored sherwani and aviator sunglasses. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, who skipped the red carpet entirely, were seen on social media dressed in gold and red saris respectively. Kim\u2019s ensemble featured an off-the-shoulder tasseled bodice, whereas Khlo\u00e9 opted for long, ornate sleeves, stacked necklaces and an opulent maang tikka. In an Instagram story, Kim teased that their film crew was in tow for an episode of their show \u201cThe Kardashians.\u201d Once inside the venue, which was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, footage widely shared on social media showed celebrities including Chopra and Cena dancing and letting loose. As for the couple itself, the groom first arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers, which he later changed for the ceremony. The bride dazzled in hand-embroidered bridal couture by the Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Merchant followed the Gujarati tradition of wearing red and white in an opulent red-trimmed ivory ensemble. It featured a 16-foot-long veil adorned with stones and sequins and a long ghagra, or traditional skirt, with a nearly seven-foot-long detachable train, according to her stylist Rhea Kapoor, who shared a first look on Instagram. In a video posted to social media on Friday morning, Anant\u2019s mother Nita Ambani recounted a recent trip to Varanasi, in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state, where she sought blessings for the pair. She said she hoped to \u201creimagine and present the purity, positivity and beauty of Varanasi at the wedding,\u201d adding that the event would \u201cpay a tribute to India\u2019s glorious culture and heritage, brought to life by thousands of artisans\u2026 weavers and craftspeople.\u201d It was also revealed that the gown Nita Ambani wore on the event red carpet took more than 40 days to create. The custom peach silk ghagra was designed by couture house Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and artisans Vijay Kumar and Monika Maurya. A lavish affair The Ambani family has remained tight-lipped about proceedings in the build-up to Friday\u2019s wedding, though rumors about the guest list and the identity of star performers have swirled in recent weeks. Local press and Indian social media users have also pored over speculation over everything from the dinner menu to the items of jewelry that might be on display from the family\u2019s sizable collection. One of India\u2019s best-known fashion designers, Manish Malhotra, served as the event\u2019s creative director. The celebrated couturier produced bespoke outfits for various members of the Ambani family throughout the month-long wedding celebrations. \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event \u2026 is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he told CNN via e-mail ahead of the wedding. In the days leading up to Friday\u2019s ceremony, the couple took part in several traditional pre-wedding rituals. Justin Bieber performed at the pair\u2019s \u201csangeet,\u201d a night of music and dance, last Friday. The couple then attended a private \u201chaldi\u201d ceremony, which traditionally sees friends and family bless the bride and groom by applying a turmeric paste to their heads, faces or bodies. As per Hindu tradition, the wedding dates were reportedly chosen according to auspicious days on the bride and groom\u2019s birth charts. A Brown University graduate, 29-year-old Anant Ambani is Mukesh\u2019s youngest child and serves as director at an energy business operated by Reliance. His bride Radhika Merchant, also 29, is the daughter of Viren and Shaila Merchant, the founders of pharmaceutical company Encore Healthcare. It is not known precisely how much money the Ambani family has spent on the pair\u2019s wedding celebrations. Industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars, with musical performers reported to be receiving seven- or even eight-figure sums. On the streets of Mumbai, residents spoken to by CNN had mixed feelings about the extravagant event \u2014 and the wealth on display. \u201cIt\u2019s their wealth but it is beyond ridiculous what they are doing,\u201d said preschool teacher Devanshi Zaveri, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to show off that much.\u201d Banker Jenica Kothari meanwhile welcomed the boost to local businesses: \u201cIt\u2019s helping the economy, it\u2019s helping everyone\u2026 So, I think if they have the money, they should spend it.\u201d Local hotel rates reportedly soared as the thousands of guests prepared to jet to Mumbai, a financial hub that serves as India\u2019s commercial capital. Months of celebrations Festivities are set to continue through the weekend at the Ambani family\u2019s soaring 27-story Mumbai residence, Antilia. Saturday is expected to see a \u201cShubh Ashirwad,\u201d or divine blessings ceremony, while a Sunday reception (with an \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code) will give guests a final chance to celebrate with the couple. The weekend schedule concludes seven months of build-up to what has been described as India\u2019s wedding of year. Celebrations kicked off with a celebrity-filled engagement party in January. Two months later, the Ambanis hosted a communal dinner for more than 50,000 villagers and a 1,200-guest pre-wedding bash \u2014 attended by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump \u2014 featuring a rare live performance by Rihanna. In May, the family then chartered a cruise ship to take guests on a four-day trip around the Mediterranean. The schedule included multiple stops through Europe and on-deck concerts from the Backstreet Boys and Pitbull, among others. Anant\u2019s older sister, Isha, also held a lavish wedding in 2018. Her marriage to businessman Anand Piramal was watched by celebrities, politicians and business tycoons, while her pre-wedding bash featured an intimate private concert by Beyonc\u00e9.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_australia-mona-museum-picasso-restroom-intl-hnk", "text": "A museum in Australia has moved Picasso artworks to a women\u2019s restroom, skirting a discrimination complaint by a male visitor who couldn\u2019t enter an exhibit where the works were previously hung. Two paintings and a drawing by Pablo Picasso  were originally featured in American artist and museum curator  Kirsha Kaechele\u2019s \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d installation at Tasmania\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) \u2013 \u00a0which opened in December 2020 \u2013 \u201cto any and all ladies.\u201d The experiential artwork was billed by the museum as a \u201ctremendously lavish space\u201d where women can indulge in \u201cdecadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures\u201d served by a male butler while they peruse art in a green velvet-draped room. But MONA was ordered to stop refusing entry to \u201cpersons who do not identify as ladies\u201d after the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled in April that the show violated Australia\u2019s 1998 Anti-Discrimination Act. Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room was indeed part of the art \u2014 giving\u00a0them\u00a0a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. The Picasso pieces are now displayed in an upgraded restroom with a fully functional toilet dubbed \u201cLadies Room,\u201d located within the art venue, Kaechele said in an e-mail. \u201cWhile the Ladies Lounge undergoes a series of reforms to meet the exemptions required for reopening, I\u2019ve been doing a little redecorating. I thought a few of the bathrooms in the museum could do with an update,\u201d she added. \u201cSome Cubism in the cubicles.\u201d On Monday, Kaechele posted on Instagram a video and images of the relocated works in situ, and pointed out that the gendered restroom was also a first for the museum. She encouraged \u201call ladies\u201d to enjoy the new exhibition. \u2018Ladies Lounge\u2019 closed \u201cWe never had female toilets at Mona before, they were all unisex. But then the Ladies Lounge had to close thanks to a lawsuit brought on by a man. And I just didn\u2019t know what to do with all those Picassos\u2026,\u201d wrote Kaechele, who is also the wife of MONA\u2019s owner, David Walsh. Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales was barred from entering the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d exhibit on April 1 in 2023. Lau, who had paid the $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, believed he experienced direct gender discrimination. \u201cHe felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,\u201d read the tribunal\u2019s notes. After the judgment, Kaechele said she would challenge the court\u2019s decision in the state\u2019s Supreme Court and offered several possibilities to revive the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d concept. Among those ideas included finding loopholes under Section 27 of the Anti-Discrimination Act which lists exceptions on when discrimination against gender would be permitted. In the meantime the lounge closed so that it wouldn\u2019t have to open to men. Kaechele later discussed potential ways to reopen \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d as a church, school, toilet and more in a Q&A that was published on the museum\u2019s website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/australia-mona-museum-picasso-restroom-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

The area has been cordoned off as a crime scene, and \u201cpreliminary investigations suggest a similar mode of killing of the deceased,\u201d the statement said. The bodies were found wrapped in \u201cnylon papers and reinforced with nylon ropes\u201d and have been transported to a mortuary where \u201cthey await postmortem examinations,\u201d police added. The identities of the dead or how long the bodies had been at the quarry were not immediately clear. \u201cIt appears to be a dumping site for bodies and I suspect there could be more,\u201d Hussein Khalid, executive director of human rights group Vocal Africa told CNN. \u201cThey were all women, all tied with the same color of ribbons, and same color of sacks,\u201d he said. Angry residents who marched to the nearby Kware police station were dispersed by teargas as shots rang in the air. CNN has reached out to the police for comment. The horrifying scene comes after weeks of anti-government protests over a since-scrapped finance bill. The protests resulted in scores of civilian deaths amid a heavy-handed response from Kenyan police. Human rights groups have also accused security forces of abducting Kenyans during the protests. The discovery of the bodies on Friday has sparked fresh public anger and brought a new spotlight to Kenya\u2019s femicide crisis, just months after thousands of women marched on the streets with banners reading: \u201cStop killing us.\u201d Fallout from protests Dozens of people were killed in police shootings across the country in just one day of the anti-government protests in June, according to\u00a0Kenya\u2019s Police Reforms Working Group (PRWG).

A woman and man were \u201ckilled on the spot\u201d in the Golan Heights when a projectile directly hit their vehicle, according to Israeli police. \u201cSeveral projectiles were identified falling in the area,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) added in a statement following sirens in the Golan Heights. \u201cTonight what we had been warning and talked about for three months happened; We lost lives of residents from the Golan community,\u201d head of the Golan Regional Council\u00a0Ori Kallner\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cWe call on the government of Israel and the IDF on this difficult evening to protect the residents of the Golan, to stop the policy of restraint, attack our enemies with force and restore security to the residents of the north and the Golan.\u201d \u201cWe will not allow the Golan to be turned into Israel\u2019s security zone. The offensive must be moved into the other side of the border, into enemy territory,\u201d Kallner added. Israel\u2019s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the country\u2019s Defense Ministry, also called on the Israeli military to \u201cstrike Hezbollah and Lebanon mercilessly.\u201d The Golan Heights is under Israeli government control and is considered to be occupied territory by the international community. Earlier, Magen David Adom paramedics had described responding to a \u201cdifficult\u201d scene at the site of the hit on the vehicle. \u201cWe saw a vehicle that suffered a direct hit, and in its front were an unconscious man and woman who were critically injured. During the medical treatment, additional sirens were activated,\u201d the medics said in a statement. \u201cWe ran to protect ourselves and handled the incident as sirens went off. Military personnel assisted on the scene.\u201d Firefighters said they were responding to at least eight fires following the projectile hits. In a statement, Hezbollah said that they had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets on the Golan Heights \u201cin response\u201d to an alleged Israeli attack in Syria targeting a Hezbollah key member earlier on Tuesday. Hezbollah member Yasser Nemr Qranbish was killed\u00a0in an attack targeting him in an area west of the capital, Damascus, on the old Damascus-Beirut road, the group added, without providing further details. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the strike. The Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday that the Israeli Air Force \u201cstruck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in the area of Qabrikha from which the projectiles were launched toward the area of the Golan Heights.\u201d \u201cIn addition, the IAF struck Hezbollah military structures in the area of Kfarkela in southern Lebanon,\u201d the IDF statement added. Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began. But it has been gradually intensifying, raising fears it could escalate into a full-blown conflict. Hezbollah is one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, with tens of thousands of fighters and a vast missile arsenal. The group has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support Palestinians in Gaza. Smotrich extended condolences to the families of those killed and said the Israeli military and government should \u201crestore security\u201d for residents of the Golan Heights. \u201cThe time has come for courage and valor also from the leadership of the IDF and the state of Israel, and as I have been demanding for a long time, to strike Hezbollah and Lebanon mercilessly and restore security to the residents of the North,\u201d said Smotrich, who also holds a position in the Defense Ministry, in a statement on Tuesday night. Former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz also commented on the attack, saying it was \u201conce again a difficult and sad evening.\u201d \u201cThe operative effort should have been transferred to the North in March, as we demanded. Prime Minister Netanyahu hesitated, and refused to add the return of the residents of the north to their homes by September 1 to the objectives of the war \u2013 and we are paying the price. And that price is heavy,\u201d said Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu\u2019s government in June.

Created as a celebration of women and justice, the statue\u2019s hair was braided into two ram horns (a symbol of strength, according to Madison Square Park\u2019s exhibition guide) and features a large hoop skirt \u2014 inspired by the stained-glass ceiling dome at the courthouse\u00a0\u2014 smattered with shards of painted mosaic pieces: A woman decorated by a broken glass ceiling. But these artistic features, particularly the braided horns and abstract branch-like arms, have drawn criticism and attention. In February, a Texas anti-abortion group called the piece \u2013 which also features an intricate lace collar -\u00a0a \u201csatanic\u201d memorial of the late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and staged a protest demanding the removal of the artwork.

{"id": "2024_07_12_middleeast_israeli-military-withdrawal-central-northern-gaza-palestinians-killed-intl", "text": "At least 50 Palestinians were found killed on Friday, local authorities said, after the Israeli military pulled back from several areas in central and northern Gaza, leaving entire\u00a0neighborhoods razed and residents reeling from a spate of heavy attacks. Emergency crews recovered 50 to 60 bodies in the Tal al-Hawa neighborhood in the west of Gaza City, according to Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense. Many more were trapped under the debris, spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN. Further east in the city, Israeli bombardment destroyed vital infrastructure in the Shujaya neighborhood, said Asem Al-Nabih, a media officer at the Gaza Municipality. Footage obtained by CNN showed rescue staff in Tal al-Hawa wading through blown out buildings, and clambering over slabs of fallen concrete piled on top of old mattresses. The limbs of dead Palestinians could be seen peeking out from under the rubble, as workers attempted to retrieve those buried by the devastation. \u201cThere is unprecedented destruction of infrastructure and vital facilities in the Shujaya\u2026 and Tal al-Hawa areas,\u201d Al-Nabih told CNN. \u201cThe municipality is trying to deliver water to displaced citizens with great difficulty.\u201d More than nine months of fighting in Gaza has turned swathes of the territory into rubble-filled wasteland. The Israeli military offensive following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has triggered a sprawling humanitarian crisis, crushed the health system and depleted food and water supplies. The UN warned Tuesday of widespread famine across the strip, and relief workers say Israeli aid restrictions mean they are unable to support Palestinians trying to survive the war. Human rights agencies reiterated calls for a ceasefire, as negotiations between Israel and Hamas this week hit yet another roadblock. Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed\u00a038,345\u00a0Palestinians and injured another 88,295 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. \u2018We want a total ceasefire\u2019 Palestinian residents surveyed the desolate landscape in Tal al-Hawa neighborhood on Friday, as the sound of Israeli drones buzzed overhead. CNN footage from the aftermath showed multiple-story blocks sliced in half. Children sat under the sun with despondent expressions on their faces. In one scene, the words \u201cGaza, I promise we will rebuild it,\u201d could be seen scrawled onto the wall of a damaged building. \u201cI don\u2019t know what crime civilians did to deserve this,\u201d one resident, Tareq Ghanem, told CNN on Friday. \u201cPeople are dying in the streets. The bodies are strewn in the streets for 4 to 5 (days), maybe a week, and no civil defense can evacuate them. Where is the international law?\u201d Another Palestinian, Umm Ihab Arafat, said she and her family had been displaced at least four times since the war erupted. The mother told CNN she was desperate to return home for the wellbeing of her children. \u201cWe want a total ceasefire,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be displaced from one place to another. The fear is in the eyes of the young ones.\u201d A CNN stringer in the area reported Friday there had been a partial withdrawal from several locations \u2013 including Tal Al-Hawa, Al-Rimal and the vicinity of the UNRWA headquarters on Al-Sina\u2019a Street. Further south, in the coastal tent city of Al-Mawasi, two people were killed and five other Palestinians wounded by an airstrike on an aid warehouse, according to the Civil Defense. CNN has provided the Israeli military with the coordinates of the strike and sought comment. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed troops in central Gaza \u201clocated a weapons production workshop\u201d and \u201cfunds used for terrorist activity,\u201d adding that \u201cterrorists who posed a threat to the troops in the area were eliminated.\u201d The IDF also said that it had attacked the site of rocket launches in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza, and had continued assaults in Rafah, southern Gaza. CNN cannot verify the IDF statements. Also in central Gaza, a CNN stringer reported that four Palestinians, including two children, had been killed by an Israeli airstrike in the New Nuseirat camp early Friday. CNN has asked the IDF about its operations in central Gaza. Almost the whole population \u2013 1.9 million people \u2013 have been displaced, according to the UN. Earlier this week, several Palestinians told CNN they were terrified to leave areas in the north under Israeli evacuation orders amid heavy shelling, citing no promise of safety or accommodation.

{"id": "2024_07_11_middleeast_israeli-military-inquiry-kibbutz-beeri-intl-latam", "text": "An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) internal investigation into the failures to protect the kibbutz of Be\u2019eri on October 7 found that the Israeli military \u201cfailed in its mission to protect the residents\u201d and \u201cwas not prepared for the extensive infiltration scenario\u201d by Hamas that day, which involved \u201cmultiple infiltration points by thousands of terrorists attacking dozens of locations simultaneously.\u201d Be\u2019eri, located in southern Israel, was one of the hardest hit communities in the October 7 attacks\u00a0when Hamas militants stormed the kibbutz, killing 101 of its residents, including children. Thirty people were abducted from the kibbutz that day. The inquiry said the military had trained for isolated and specific infiltrations. \u201cAs a result, there were no additional reserve forces in the area that could have been sent to Kibbutz Be\u2019eri,\u201d the inquiry said. Responding to the inquiry\u2019s report, the Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said it \u201cclearly illustrates the magnitude of the failure and the scale of the disaster that befell the residents of the south who defended their families with their bodies for many hours while the IDF was not there to protect them.\u201d The inquiry found that \u201cthe IDF struggled to create a clear and accurate situational assessment of what was happening in the kibbutz until the afternoon of October 7,\u201d even though the local emergency team had provided an updated assessment. \u201cCombat in the area during the initial hours was characterized by a lack of command and control, a lack of coordination, and a lack of order among the different forces and units. This led to several incidents where security forces grouped at the entrance to the kibbutz without immediately engaging in combat,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe inquiry found that the security officials did not provide sufficient warning to the residents of Kibbutz Be\u2019eri about the infiltration of terrorists during the initial hours of the terrorist attack,\u201d the report continued. The inquiry concluded that the turning point came only when a senior officer was appointed to coordinate forces in the area, leading to the regaining of operational control of the kibbutz. \u201cDespite operational errors and mistakes in force deployment, the inquiry team noted that the combat in Be\u2019eri included a series of acts of heroism and supreme courage by the fighting forces, commanders, and security personnel who fought in the kibbutz, saving many residents,\u201d the report said. It also said \u201cthe bravery of the Be\u2019eri residents and the members of the kibbutz\u2019s civilian rapid response team is commendable and was crucial in stabilizing the defensive line during the first hours of combat, preventing the attack from spreading to other parts of the kibbutz.\u201d The inquiry also found that the security forces who fought in the area \u201coperated with great bravery and heroism.\u201d 31 security personnel were killed in the area after some \u201c340 terrorists infiltrated the kibbutz,\u201d of whom about 100 were killed, it said. At a briefing Thursday, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said more findings would be presented in the coming months. \u201cThis investigation is not the end of a process, it is the beginning.\u201d Timeline of attack The inquiry team found that that the attack on Be\u2019eri began at around 7 a.m. local time on October 7 and that Hamas controlled the kibbutz for about four hours. During this period, the \u201cfirst IDF soldiers arrive, are hit, evacuate the wounded, exit the kibbutz, and, positioning themselves at the entrance of the kibbutz, engage in combat with the terrorists who reached the gate.\u201d By 4.15 p.m., the 99th\u00a0Division had established itself at the kibbutz and began organizing command and control. By 6 p.m., \u201cabout 700 IDF soldiers and security forces are operating in the area of the kibbutz,\u201d the inquiry found. The Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Halevi, accepted the conclusions of the inquiry, and acknowledged that \u201cthe IDF did not fulfil its mission to defend the residents in the most grave manner and failed in its mission.\u201d Halevi noted that \u201cfrom the afternoon hours onwards, forces were waiting outside the kibbutz while the massacre continued inside. This situation is extremely grave and cannot occur.\u201d \u201cThe reasons for this were found to include that commanders who arrived with forces entered the kibbutz with a part of the force to better understand the situation; some forces did not initiate contact since they did not understand the severity of the situation and the lack of adequate forces; some of those waiting outside were support forces providing a perimeter for those engaged in combat inside the kibbutz,\u201d he said. As for prioritizing the evacuation of wounded soldiers, Halevi said that civilian protection was the highest-priority mission. \u201cSoldiers must always give priority to assisting civilians in evacuation, defense and any other need that arises in a combat zone,\u201d he said. Separately,\u00a0Halevi told a graduation ceremony Thursday for new officers that the IDF had worked with all partners \u201cto understand in detail and depth what happened and what we must learn to prevent it from happening again in the future.\u201d Be\u2019eri kibbutz survivors were presented with the findings of the report earlier Thursday. \u201cIt can be said that the investigation was thorough and helped the members of the kibbutz understand a little the depth and complexity of the fighting in the various sectors of the kibbutz,\u201d a statement released by Be\u2019eri spokesperson Michal Paykin said. But he said some important questions remained unanswered. \u201cFor example: Why did the many military forces who gathered at the gate not enter the kibbutz for many hours, when the kibbutz was burning, and its residents were crying for help?\u00a0What caused the intelligence failure that enabled the Hamas invasion plan, and how was the border fence breached without an immediate response from the IDF?\u201d he said. Members of \u201cKibbutz Be\u2019eri did not need the results of the investigation to feel the failure of the IDF\u201d that morning. \u201cThe failure of the army has been burned into our bodies and in our hearts for nine months,\u201d the statement adds. Former residents are now calling for a state commission of inquiry to \u201cexamine the conduct of all the parties and provide us with answers with which we can begin to recover,\u201d the statement added. \u201cFinally, and most importantly, we demand to deal with the abandonment that is happening right now across the border - the abandonment of the hostages to their fate for nine months.\u00a0 The ongoing failure to return them to this day must stop,\u201d the statement ends. Speaking about a state inquiry, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Thursday at the officers\u2019 graduation ceremony: \u201cIt should check all of us: decision-makers and executive officers, the government, the army and the security agencies, in this government, and in the governments of the last decade that led to the events of October 7.\u201d \u201cIt should examine me, the Minister of Defense, it should examine the Prime Minister, the Chief of Staff and the head of the Shin Bet, the IDF, and the national bodies subordinate to the government,\u201d Gallant said. A commission \u201cmust examine the intelligence and operational failure of the events of the 7th October,\u201d as well as examine \u201cthe errors made in assessing the enemy\u2019s capabilities and in warning of its intentions\u00a0 - that culminated on the 7th of October,\u201d Gallant said. Focus on 13 hostages One focus of the inquiry into events at Be\u2019eri on October 7 was the effort to save 13 people held hostage in a house at the kibbutz. There had been speculation that the hostages had been killed by tank fire from the Israeli military as it tried to force entry to the house, but the inquiry found that Hamas operatives at the house probably killed the hostages. \u201cAfter gunfire was heard from within the house and the terrorists communicated their intent to commit suicide and kill the hostages, the security forces decided to breach the house to attempt to save the hostages, and conducted combat operations under difficult conditions,\u201d the inquiry concluded. It said that\u00a0\u201ccommanders and forces made professional and responsible decisions, and fully exhausted negotiation efforts. The tank fire towards the area near the house was carried out\u00a0professionally, with a joint decision made by commanders from all the security organizations after careful consideration\u2026 with the intent to apply pressure to the terrorists and save the civilians held hostage inside.\u201d \u201cThe team determined that, based on the information reviewed and to the best of their understanding, no civilians inside the building were harmed by tank shell fire, except for an isolated incident outside the building where two civilians were injured by shrapnel,\u201d \ufeffit continued. \u201cThe team determined that most of the hostages were likely murdered by the terrorists, and further inquiries and reviews of additional findings are necessary.\u201d Regarding the conclusions, Halevi said,\u00a0\u201cIn such events, the commander on the ground must make difficult decisions with the goal of saving as many civilians as possible. The inquiry revealed that this value guided the decision-making of the commanders on the ground during this event.\u201d Hagari said later Thursday that the IDF had been trying to carry out negotiations with Hamas but those failed. \u201cThe decision to carry out a rescue attempt under fire was made after all attempts to hold negotiations to rescue the hostages were exhausted, and after a long burst of gunfire was heard from inside the house, which raised the suspicion that the hostages were being murdered,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/middleeast/israeli-military-inquiry-kibbutz-beeri-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_french-elections-political-violence-intl-latam", "text": "French authorities have recorded more than 50 physical assaults on candidates and campaigners on the campaign trail, the country\u2019s Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said Friday as concerns mount about political violence ahead of\u00a0France\u2019s high-stakes parliamentary elections. \u201cThis campaign is short, less than three weeks. However, we have counted 51 candidates, deputies, or campaigners who have been physically assaulted. I am not counting verbal aggressions here,\u201d Darmanin told CNN affiliate BFMTV. The attacks have ranged from the less severe to \u201cextremely serious,\u201d Darmanin said, adding that some candidates have been hospitalised for their injuries. Roughly thirty or so people have been taken in for questioning in relation to the attacks, Darmanin added. France has been grappling with high tensions in the run-up to this Sunday\u2019s elections. An additional 30,000 police have been laid on to ensure that neither the far-left nor the far-right succeed in \u201ccreating disorder,\u201d Darmanin said earlier this week. Politicians have\u00a0repeatedly warned that a far-right victory\u00a0could provoke huge protests in the streets, with French President Emmanuel Macron going so far as to say \u201ccivil war\u201d may break out if the extreme left or right wins by a large margin in Sunday\u2019s runoff vote. French government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot and her team came under attack while canvassing on Wednesday night. Meanwhile, National Rally (RN) politician Marie Dauchy, who is running in the southeastern constituency of Savoie, opted to suspend her campaign after she said was physically assaulted while campaigning at a market. In Cherbourg, a center-right candidate from The Republicans party, Nicolas Conquer, made a formal complaint after he claimed he was assaulted by left-wing campaigners on Monday. The terror threat in the country \u201cremains extremely strong,\u201d the interior minister warned on Friday, adding that several arrests had recently taken place in two separate places. Although the two incidents \u201ccould qualify as terrorist\u201d incidents, they need to be formally classified as such by the national anti-terrorist prosecutor, Darmanin added. RN, the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, led the first round of\u00a0France\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary elections last Sunday, taking it closer to the gates of power than ever before. After an unusually high turnout, the RN bloc clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second with 27.99% and Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published by the Interior Ministry on Monday. While the RN appears on track to win the most seats in the National Assembly, it may fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, suggesting France may be heading for a hung parliament and more political uncertainty.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/french-elections-political-violence-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_europe_crossbow-attack-violence-women-bbc-journalist-intl-gbr", "text": "Figures from across the United Kingdom have offered their condolences to a BBC sport commentator, after his wife and two daughters were killed by an alleged crossbow attacker, in deaths that again drew attention to the epidemic of violence against women. Carol Hunt, 61, wife of BBC horse racing commentator, John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, died from injuries sustained in an attack in Bushey, just northwest of London, on Tuesday, according to police and Britain\u2019s public broadcaster. A 26-year-old suspect wanted in connection with the killings, and named as Kyle Clifford, was found by British police in Enfield, north London, on Wednesday, following a sprawling manhunt. There were no previous reports to the force over Clifford, who is in serious condition in hospital and is yet to speak with officers, Hertfordshire Police said in a statement. A crossbow was recovered as part of the investigation, which police believe was used in a \u201ctargeted incident.\u201d Epidemic of violence against women The killings of the three women rocked Britain, where mass murders are infrequent but violence against women and girls has been officially labeled as a national threat. A woman is killed by a man every three days in the UK and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem,\u00a0said earlier this year. Charities and human rights organizations have subsequently reiterated urgent demands to tackle femicide in the UK. \u201cMale violence against women and girls is at epidemic levels,\u201d said SafeLives, a UK-based charity working to end domestic abuse, adding: \u201cDomestic abuse is a major public health crisis. It should be given the same priority as terrorism.\u201d Refuge, a UK-based non-profit providing support for survivors of domestic abuse, posted on X: \u201cOur thoughts are with Carol, Hannah and Louise Hunt and their family and friends following the devastating incident in Bushey.\u201d British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called the attack \u201ctruly shocking,\u201d adding that she is \u201cbeing kept fully updated\u201d by authorities. The country\u2019s new Labour government campaigned on a manifesto to \u201ctackle the scourge of violence against women and girls\u201d in Britain, including a review of the sentencing process, and requiring forces to target repeat offenders with tools used for counter-terror and serious organized crime investigations. \u2018His life was ripped apart\u2019 An array of BBC journalists paid tributes to their colleague, in an outpouring of grief across the organization and wider sports industry. BBC Sport presenter Mark Chapman said: \u201cJohn\u00a0Hunt\u00a0is our colleague, and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live Sport team, but to all of those who have worked here with him over the past 20 years. \u201cOn behalf of everybody connected to 5 Live Sport, our love and thoughts and support are with\u00a0John\u00a0and his family,\u201d Chapman said live on air. Dan Walker, who used to host the BBC show Football Focus,\u00a0posted on X\u00a0that: \u201cJohn\u00a0Hunt\u00a0is one of the best and his life was ripped apart yesterday.\u201d Tim Peach, a producer for BBC Cricket, described\u00a0Hunt\u00a0as \u201cone of the kindest, most thoughtful people I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s peerless at his job,\u201d Peach said on X, \u201cbut he\u2019s always happiest talking about \u2018my Carol\u2019 and \u2018my girls.\u2019\u201d Michael Owen, a former soccer player and racehorse owner,\u00a0also posted\u00a0on X following England\u2019s soccer win at the European Championship, writing that \u201cwhile the country celebrate(s), spare a thought for\u00a0John\u00a0Hunt. I can\u2019t remember feeling so utterly horrified in years. Those poor girls. Truly horrific.\u201d The British Horseracing Authority (BHA)\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that its thoughts are with\u00a0Hunt, his family, and friends. \u201cIt is impossible to comprehend the horror that has been inflicted upon them by this dreadful event,\u201d Julie Harrington, the BHA chief executive, said. Ascot Racecourse, one of Britain\u2019s most famous horse-racing grounds, said that it echoed the BHA\u2019s words and posted that\u00a0\u201cour thoughts are with\u00a0John\u00a0Hunt\u00a0at this tragic time.\u201d Crossbow legislation in the UK The strength of crossbow laws in the UK was called into question last year, after a British man was incarcerated for breaking into Windsor Castle and planning to assassinate the late Queen Elizabeth II with the weapon in 2021. At the time, the former Conservative government did not change the legislation, despite launching an eight-week review of the rules and the possibility of introducing a licensing scheme. In Britain, it is legal for a person to buy or own a crossbow if they are over 18, though anyone who carries one in public without a reasonable excuse can face imprisonment.  Crossbow attacks in the UK are rare, with fewer than 10 homicides by crossbow between 2011 and 2021, according to the government. The British home secretary is now re-examining the country\u2019s crossbow laws, according to her colleague, security minister Dan Jarvis. \u201cWe are seized by the seriousness and the importance of this,\u201d Jarvis told the BBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday, adding that the new government has \u201cmade a manifesto commitment\u201d to halve violence against women and girls in Britain over a 10-year period. \u201cWe will move as quickly as we possibly can to reach a judgement about whether we do need to amend the existing legislative framework,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "All five Americans arrested in recent months in Turks and Caicos under gun control laws that make bringing firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police a crime has been sentenced. Michael Lee Evans, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, of Oklahoma; and Tyler Wenrich, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. All have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers who went to the British Overseas Territory in May as part of efforts to petition for their expedited release. Though the infractions had carried a mandatory 12-year prison sentence and fine \u2013 with reductions only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2013 a mid-June revision clarified courts may impose a fine, a custodial sentence or both in exceptional circumstances, a member of the territory\u2019s House of Assembly said June 14. All five Americans arrested under the law have pleaded guilty, been sentenced and returned to the US. Here\u2019s what we know about the laws in Turks and Caicos and the affected Americans: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased \u2013 and that\u2019s a worry, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, taking firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The mandatory sentence was in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam has said, adding judges could use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said: \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly.\u201d Even so, the \u201camendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity,\u201d House of Assembly member\u00a0Edwin\u00a0Astwood said in a statement. \u201cThis often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender.\u201d US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick has said, and none got a 12-year sentence. While Turks and Caicos collaborates with the US in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was sentenced July 11 to a suspended\u00a023-week sentence and fined $1,500 following her\u00a0arrest in mid-May, her attorney Sheena C. Mair\u00a0confirmed to CNN. Grier planned to pay the fine and board a same-day flight from\u00a0Turks\u00a0and Caicos to the United States, Mair said. She arrived in Florida later that evening, CNN affiliate WKMG reported. \u201cIf she behaves for 12 months, nothing will happen. But if she gets in trouble in (Turks and Caicos) in those 12 months, she will serve 23 weeks,\u201d the attorney told CNN. Grier told WKMG her ordeal was \u201can emotional rollercoaster.\u201d \u201cI had ups and downs. Some days, I\u2019d be OK. The next day, I\u2019m down,\u201d she said. Grier offered a warning to travelers: \u201cBe very careful because other countries got different laws than we do, so that\u2019s very serious.\u201d The Florida mother had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said in May. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier had been released on bail but couldn\u2019t leave the island until her case concluded and had to report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said in May. Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to the United States after he received a suspended 52-week sentence in late May, which meant he didn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He got home May 24, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. Arriving at Pittsburgh International Airport, Hagerich told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife had packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home \u2013 they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark; you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced May 28 to three weeks time-served in jail and fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, a Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands spokesperson said that day in a statement. He returned home to Virginia on May 30. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9 mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. He was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation and to attend his June sentencing hearing virtually, said his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel. Evans got a suspended 33-month sentence, and his attorney believes it is unlikely he will have to serve time in jail. \u201cIf he has no problems in (Turks and Caicos) within 12 months, he will not have to do any time,\u201d Smith told CNN on June 24. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays when he was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. He plead guilty in May. The first of the Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, he got a suspended 13-week sentence and a $2,000 fine, or $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on June 21. Watson soon returned home and reunited with his family, US Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said on X. US lawmakers tried to free Americans The Americans\u2019 arrest has stoked tension between US officials and their counterparts just a few hundred miles away. A request by a US congressional delegation to the islands in May for charges against the five Americas to be dropped did not yield the desired result. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Republican US Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said May 20 in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully (in) Turks and Caicos,\u201d Republican US Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler told ABC News the same week. Meanwhile, the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the United Nations for humanitarian concerns, Reschenthaler told CNN. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler, for his part, wanted to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States,\u201d the congressman told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on May 20. \u201cThey were innocent mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On May 28, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, calling it \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "world_africa_wildlife-forensics-crime-south-africa-c2e-spc", "text": "A case of a rhino with a bullet hole through its head, a poisoned giraffe and a maimed lion are all crime scenes you might find you might find at the Wildlife Forensics Academy (WFA), an hour\u2019s drive north of Cape Town, South Africa. On a mission to tackle poaching, the WFA recreates wildlife crimes in a warehouse and students and rangers dressed in hazmat suits are taught how to handle the evidence. Across the world, wildlife crimes \u2013 including animal trafficking and poaching \u2013 are on the rise and are a major threat to the planet\u2019s biodiversity. In Africa, rhinos are a prime target, with around 10,000 lost to poaching in the last decade, the majority in South Africa. Almost 500 rhinos were poached in the country in 2023, with more than 300 from within KwaZulu-Natal province, home to Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park. Yet the province only recorded 49 related arrests and seized just 13 firearms. By providing forensics training, Greg Simpson, co-founder of the WFA, hopes to increase the rate of successful convictions. Often, he says, wildlife crimes happen in remote areas without witnesses and first responders can accidentally disrupt the scene and contaminate evidence. As a result, the culprit isn\u2019t caught or punished. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to give people skills so that they can collect evidence \u2026 that can be used in an investigation and hopefully down the line will end up in a prosecution,\u201d he says. Crime scene simulation The facility tries to make the training experience as realistic as possible. It uses life-size animals preserved by taxidermy, and some are marked with bloody wounds made with red paint. Besides the corrugated iron walls and roof, the warehouse looks like a typical dry African landscape, with sandy terrain and a scattering of plants. There is a poachers\u2019 house and truck, ready to be searched and swabbed for fingerprints, and footprints lie on the ground, ready to be measured and identified. Once the crime scene has been investigated, the students are taught how to chemically analyze the evidence at an on-site laboratory. The lessons culminate in a replica courtroom where they practice presenting the evidence at trial and undergo cross-examination. \u201cThe purpose of cross-examination is to test the credibility, the trustworthiness of evidence. And unless you can survive it, the court might not accept your evidence,\u201d says Phil Snijman, director of education at the WFA and former state advocate and prosecutor. Fingerprints, DNA samples, ballistics (when a weapon is matched to a cartridge), shoe tracks can all be discounted by the court if they have not been correctly sealed, photographed or documented, he explains. And while he does not expect the course to make students and rangers forensic experts, he believes that it will help them to preserve the evidence correctly if they are ever the first responders to a crime scene. Boosting convictions Launched in 2022, the WFA attracts university students, such as those studying veterinary or biomedical sciences, and wildlife rangers from all over the world to its one to four-week courses. This year, it expects to train around 200 people. One of them is Leita Mkhabela, a ranger from the all-female Black Mamba anti-poaching unit that operates in Greater Kruger, a collection of private game reserves in northeast South Africa, who attended a course in April. \u201cThis is something we come across every day, we have a high rate of rhino poaching,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have so many poachers that have walked free in court because rangers didn\u2019t collect enough evidence. It\u2019s really important for rangers to get this knowledge.\u201d Mkhabela plans to take back all that she has learned to her colleagues so that they can implement the techniques in the bush. She believes that increasing the rate of convictions will act as a deterrent for poachers. There are signs that the training is leading to convictions. According to the WFA, a ranger reported that since doing the course, he was able to collect traces of poison at a crime scene involving wild dogs, and police were confident they would be able to arrest and convict the poachers as a result. Other forensic laboratories have been set up across the continent, in countries such as Malawi and Botswana. One initiative, led by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), ran four workshops during 2023 and early 2024, training 80 wildlife rangers, investigators, and intelligence officers from the Kenya Wildlife Service on collecting and presenting evidence in court. In the first quarter of this year, IFAW reported 32 wildlife crime cases being presented in court and 24 people accused of wildlife crimes awaiting prosecution. Previously, these cases would have been dropped due to a lack of sufficient evidence, it says. Kevin Pretorius, director of the Green Law Foundation and a practicing attorney at the High Court of South Africa, who specializes in criminal and environmental law, and is not involved with WFA, says that one of the main hurdles in convicting wildlife crimes is the \u201cadmissibility of evidence,\u201d especially since the charge must be proven \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cThe training of a cohort of people that understand the value of evidence, and that a crime scene tells a story, and that story can assist the investigator in linking the perpetrator to a crime, is always valuable,\u201d he says. For the WFA, assisting law enforcement is its central mission, but it also hopes to raise awareness of the threats presented by the illegal wildlife trade and why it should be treated as a priority. \u201cIt\u2019s a threat to biodiversity, it\u2019s a threat to human health,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cIf we can improve knowledge around this, that would be really valuable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/wildlife-forensics-crime-south-africa-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gleason told Brees he \u201cloved him\u201d and called the award a \u201csublime honor.\u201d \u201cI always love the opportunity to wear my tuxedo,\u201d Gleason joked to the crowd. \u201cArthur Ashe exemplified courage as living with an open heart of humility, kindness and generosity which united humanity, so to receive this award is amazing. \u201cWhen I learned I was receiving this award, I started reflecting on what that word meant \u2018courage\u2019 means. To be courageous, we must first experience loneliness, unworthiness or any of the faces of fear.\u201d Gleason continued that he was told he only had three years to live after his diagnosis, adding that he has the \u201cwilderness of fear tattooed\u201d all over him. \u201cFor me, this honor represents some encouragement and triumph for the families currently living with ALS. All the people living with disability or other illnesses and all of you who experience fear or suffering,\u201d Gleason continued. \u201cI suppose if you have never experienced fear, isolation, or suffering, you can roll your sanctified a** right out of here. The truth is no human is immune from fear or adversity. Not even super athletes, royal princes or most holy saints.\u201d Gleason expressed his gratitude to his family, community and caregivers for their support in keeping him alive. \u201cI\u2019d have been dead years ago,\u201d Gleason said. \u201cThrough this lens, you can see we are all in this together. We are all citizens of the world. If we can listen, understand, and help alleviate each other\u2019s suffering then truly all things are possible.\u201d Earlier in the night, South Carolina women\u2019s basketball head coach Dawn Staley received the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance in honor of her work in advocating for cancer research and bone marrow donors. Staley\u2019s sister was diagnosed with leukemia in 2020 and was present at the awards. Staley, who led the Gamecocks to a third national championship and a perfect 38-0 record this past season, said in a powerful speech that people have the \u201cpower to make a difference\u201d and \u201cstand up for what is right.\u201d \u201cYou can inspire, motivate and help others,\u201d Staley continued. \u201cAll it takes is the will to do so.\u201d The 54-year-old added that she felt \u201ca little undeserving of this recognition.\u201d Staley continued: \u201cPast recipients of the Jimmy V Award have faced incredible challenges and proven themselves as true warriors. I have merely been a spectator to such immense resilience.\u201d WNBA star Caitlin Clark took two awards home: Best College Athlete - Women\u2019s Sports and Best Record-Breaking Performance award. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes won Best Athlete in Men\u2019s Sports and Best NFL Player. Las Vegas Aces star A\u2019ja Wilson won the Best Athlete in Women\u2019s Sports award.

Microsoft took a\u00a0non-voting, observer position\u00a0on OpenAI\u2019s board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company, which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. The seat meant it could attend OpenAI\u2019s board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors. The observer seat and Microsoft\u2019s more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the US over how much control it exerts over OpenAI. Microsoft cited OpenAI\u2019s new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman\u2019s return to the startup for giving up its observer seat. \u201cOver the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction.

At least five passages near Panama\u2019s border with Colombia have been shut using barbed wire installed by\u00a0the country\u2019s border agency (Senafront). Meanwhile, Panama\u2019s navy is patrolling areas in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. The government said the navy is instructed to stop and detain people traveling by boat with \u201cirregular migrants\u201d and to hand them over to police or immigration authorities from Colombia. On land, border authorities have closed irregular access areas with the goal of rerouting people through established border points. The United States and Panama signed\u00a0an agreement this month on immigration issues that aimed to \u201cclose the passage of illegal migrants\u201d through the Dari\u00e9n Gap. Panama\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino has also vowed to stop the Central American country from being a transit route for migrants. \u201cI will not allow\u00a0Panama\u00a0to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino\u00a0said at his swearing-in ceremony on July 1. Mulino visited the Dari\u00e9n Gap days before Thursday\u2019s announcement, saying 300 border agents were going to be deployed to monitor the area and declaring that no one would enter\u00a0Panamanian territory without a passport or a valid document. Colombia\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s Office has criticized Panama\u2019s latest move saying that the barbed wires affect at least one Colombian town\u2019s commercial and cultural exchange with areas in\u00a0Panama. \u201cThe barbed wires in the jungle will only bring drowned people into the sea. Migration is stopped by removing economic blockades and improving the economy of the south,\u201d Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro wrote on X. The Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the\u00a0Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap\u00a0brings migrants from Colombia to\u00a0Panama\u00a0and is a crucial passage for those \u2013 many of whom come from other Latin American countries \u2013 hoping to reach the US and Canada.

Presenting the event with her sister and fellow tennis icon Venus Williams and Abbott Elementary actress Quinta Brunson, the 23-time grand slam champion delivered a dig at Butker during a segment about women\u2019s sports. \u201cSo go ahead and enjoy women\u2019s sports like you would any other sports because they are sports,\u201d Venus said to wrap up the segment. \u201cExcept you, Harrison Butker.

Butker was in attendance at the event. Williams has been a staunch advocate of women\u2019s sports and told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies earlier this year that \u201cwomen\u2019s sport is having a moment that it always should\u2019ve had.\u201d She also exclusively revealed her interest in owning a WNBA team in the interview. Williams\u2019 remark at the ESPYs was made in response to a speech that Butker made in May to 485 graduates at Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas. He decried Pride Month as a \u201cdeadly sin\u201d and suggested that women find more fulfillment through getting married and having children than by pursuing careers. \u201cI want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\u201d he said in the speech to the group of male and female graduates. \u201cHow many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.\u201d Butker described the role of a woman as a \u201chomemaker\u201d as \u201cone of the most important titles of all\u201d and also referenced pop superstar Taylor Swift, who is dating Butker\u2019s teammate Travis Kelce.

{"id": "2024_07_11_china_nato-china-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk", "text": "China is a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, NATO leaders said\u00a0Wednesday, as the defense alliance hardens its stance on Beijing and\u00a0the \u201csystemic challenges\u201d they say it poses to their countries\u2019 security. The joint declaration marks NATO\u2019s most pointed tone yet on China\u2019s role in a war that has galvanized the 75-year-old bloc, which celebrated its anniversary this week at a three-day leaders\u2019 summit in Washington hosted by US President Joe Biden. China\u2019s \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Russia and its \u201clarge-scale support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base\u201d are enabling Moscow to wage its war,\u00a0the NATO leaders\u2019 statement said, as they urged Beijing to \u201ccease all material and political support to Russia\u2019s war effort.\u201d The US and European leaders in recent months have accused China of bolstering Russia\u2019s defense sector with the export of dual-use goods. Beijing has denied supplying weaponry and maintains it keeps strict controls on such goods. The NATO leaders also elaborated to a greater extent than in the past on concerns over China\u2019s growing capabilities and activities in outer space, and reiterated their previous unease about what they called Beijing\u2019s \u201cmalicious cyber and hybrid activities,\u201d including disinformation, and \u201crapidly\u201d expanding nuclear arsenal. \u201cWe remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency with the view of safeguarding the Alliance\u2019s security interests,\u201d the statement said, referring to China by the initials of its official name. \u201cAt the same time, we are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness, and protecting against the PRC\u2019s coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.\u201d The NATO leaders\u2019 declaration Wednesday comes as the 32-member alliance - historically focused on security in North America and Europe - has in recent years upped its engagement with US allies in Asia and increasingly seen its security as linked to the region, even as member countries have pursued divergent policies toward China. For the third consecutive year, leaders of New Zealand, Japan and South Korea attended the NATO leaders\u2019 summit in another sign of closer ties between the bloc and those countries, as well as Australia. China and Russia\u2019s tightening ties Beijing has deepened political, economic and military ties\u00a0with Moscow since President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022 declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership \u2013 and their shared opposition to what they said was NATO\u2019s expansion \u2013 during\u00a0the Russian leader\u2019s visit to the Chinese capital, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China has surpassed the European Union to become Russia\u2019s top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its economy, which has been heavily sanctioned in the wake of that invasion, while the two\u00a0nuclear-armed neighbors have continued to hold joint military exercises. Meanwhile, China has claimed neutrality in the war and\u00a0sought to posit itself as a potential peace broker, even as the US and European leaders have become increasingly alarmed about what they say is Beijing\u2019s backing of Moscow through\u00a0its economic and diplomatic support, as well as the provision of dual-use goods. On Thursday, China criticized the NATO statement as \u201cfilled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric,\u201d and said it was \u201cprovocative with obvious lies and smears.\u201d \u201cChina is not the creator to the Ukraine crisis. China\u2019s position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard. We aim to promote peace talks and seek political settlement,\u201d a statement from its mission to the European Union said. The Chinese statement also reiterated Beijing\u2019s position that it has never provided lethal weapons in the conflict and has strict dual-use export controls, defending its trade with Russia as \u201cnormal.\u201d The US and European leaders have in recent months raised alarm that such exports are revitalizing Russia\u2019s defense sector and allowing it to survive despite hefty international sanctions. The US has said that dual-use exports have specifically enabled the production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles. Both the US and the EU have sanctioned Chinese entities they allege are supporting the war effort. Later Thursday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry also condemned the declaration, with a spokesperson framing NATO as a \u201cgreat threat\u201d to the world and reiterating Beijing\u2019s claim that the alliance was \u201cfanning the flames\u201d of the war in Ukraine. NATO\u2019s increasing focus on Asia The NATO leaders\u2019 declaration is the latest step in what has been the bloc\u2019s gradual hardening of tone on China\u00a0in recent years. NATO leaders first mentioned the need to jointly address \u201copportunities and challenges\u201d posed by China in a 2019 declaration, before moving to refer to \u201csystemic challenges\u201d the country poses in 2021. That shift has come alongside an increased US policy focus on the Indo-Pacific amid a deepening rivalry with Beijing as China under Xi\u2019s leadership has grown increasingly aggressive in the region and\u00a0in its broader foreign policy. NATO\u2019s attention on Asia has also been accelerated over the past two and a half years by hardening geopolitical fault lines in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin\u2019s tightening relationship with not only China but also North Korea and Iran. NATO leaders on Wednesday also said Pyongyang and Tehran were \u201cfueling\u201d Russia\u2019s war through \u201cdirect military support,\u201d and condemned North Korea\u2019s exports of \u201cartillery shells and ballistic missiles\u201d to Russia \u2013 which multiple governments say they have tracked since last year when Putin hosted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Russian Far East. \u201cThe Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security,\u201d the leaders said in their declaration. \u201cWe are strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges and are enhancing our practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation, and technology,\u201d it said. Beijing has watched warily as NATO\u2019s engagement grows with other powers in the Asia-Pacific.\u00a0China is widely seen by observers as hoping to be the dominant force in the region and to push back on the US presence there, as Washington bolsters its longstanding Indo-Pacific security partnerships and interests.

{"id": "2024_07_12_travel_buckingham-palace-east-wing-opening-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Buckingham Palace\u2019s famous balcony room, where the monarch and other members of the royal family gather on special occasions before waving at cheering crowds in the streets below, is opening to the public for the first time. For royal fans who have waited for hours on The Mall in central London to get a glimpse of the clan as they make their brief balcony appearance during events such as Trooping the Colour, this could be an opportunity to see things from the royal perspective. Sadly, visitors will not be able to step out onto the balcony itself, so a peek through the net curtains will have to suffice. The 45-minute guided tours, running from July 15 to August 31, have already sold out, despite a hefty \u00a375 (around $97) price tag. They follow more than five years of renovation work to the East Wing of Buckingham Palace, which aims to preserve and improve access to the historic building for future generations, according to the Royal Collection Trust. \u201cBe one of the first visitors to enjoy an exclusive guided tour of the highlights of the East Wing of Buckingham Palace,\u201d the Royal Collection Trust says on its website, adding that visitors will get to discover the \u201cspaces beyond the famous fa\u00e7ade\u201d of the palace. The wing\u2019s Centre Room, as the room behind the balcony is officially known, will probably be the most anticipated part of the guided tour. Last month, Catherine, Princess of Wales joined other royals on the balcony to celebrate the King\u2019s official birthday, in her first public appearance since being diagnosed with cancer. In the Centre Room, a lotus flower-shaped glass chandelier will be on display, alongside two 18th-century Chinese silk wall hangings, which were given to Queen Victoria by the Emperor of China to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee in 1897. In the Yellow Drawing Room, hand-painted Chinese wallpaper from the 18th century, as well as two Chinese porcelain pagodas, will be on display. Visitors on the new tour will also be able to amble down the wing\u2019s main corridor and admire works by English painters Thomas Gainsborough and Thomas Lawrence and German painter Franz Xaver Winterhalter. The influence of Asian art on the interior design and displays of the East Wing can be traced to 1850, when the Brighton Pavilion,\u00a0 a seaside residence owned by George IV \u2013 Queen Victoria\u2019s uncle, was sold off to fund the building of the new royal wing. George IV\u2019s collection of Asian art and ceramics, which he had previously kept at the property on the south coast of England, was moved to the palace, where it remains to this day. Victoria and Prince Albert were the first royals to use Buckingham Palace as a family home, following their marriage in 1840. The East Wing was built shortly after, between 1847 and 1849, to accommodate their growing family. Today, Buckingham Palace is mainly used for official meetings and events. Britain\u2019s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, recently met with King Charles III at the palace, where the King formally asked him to form a new government. The East Wing refurb is part of a much broader \u2013 and more expensive \u2013 renovation of the palace at large, which is expected to take 10 years. In the process, floorboards have been taken up, new elevators have been installed, and thousands of artworks and artifacts have been temporarily removed to allow the restoration work to get underway. With its \u00a3369 million budget ($478 million), the extensive program of works has left a dent in royal finances. Official figures showed that the royal household spent more money than it made in 2022-23, partly because of what it described as the \u201csignificant\u201d renovation work at the palace. The East Wing tours are now fully booked for the summer, but if you\u2019re still wanting to check out the royal pad, tickets to visit Buckingham Palace\u2019s state rooms are still available, with tours running seven days a week until September 29. Tickets booked in advance for the state rooms tour cost \u00a332 ($41) for adults and \u00a316 ($21) for children between the ages of 5 and 17.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/travel/buckingham-palace-east-wing-opening-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_asia_south-korea-antidrone-lasers-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "South Korea is beginning the mass production of a low-cost laser weapon that has successfully shot down small drones during testing, the country\u2019s key arms agency said Thursday. The laser weapon, called Block-I, \u201ccan precisely strike small unmanned aerial vehicles and multicopters at close range,\u201d a news release from South Korea\u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said. The release did not give a cost for the weapon, but said each shot fired would only cost about $1.50. Imagery supplied by the agency appears to show a weapon around the size of a shipping container with a laser mounted on top and what appears to be a radar or tracking device mounted on one side of the platform. DAPA said the unit measures 9 meters by 3 meters by 3 meters (29.5 feet by 9.8 feet by 9.8 feet), and fires laser rays that are difficult if not impossible to detect before impact. \u201cIt is invisible and noiseless, does not require separate ammunition and can be operated only when electricity is supplied,\u201d the DAPA release said. Future versions could be developed to take out much bigger targets, including aircraft and ballistic missiles, which would be a potential \u201cgame changer,\u201d according to the release. DAPA will develop \u201ca laser anti-aircraft weapon (Block-II) system with improved output and range compared to the current one,\u201d the release said. But the Block-I weapon itself comes online at an important time. In Ukraine, the Middle East and elsewhere, small drones - some available off the shelf - have shown the ability to disable or destroy multimillion-dollar pieces of military hardware, including tanks. Militaries have typically responded by trying to take out low-cost drones with defensive systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars per strike. A weapon that could do the same for practically pennies would be a big boost to the country that can deploy it. \u201cLow-cost drones and rockets have swung the economic calculus of offense and defense in favor of those using large volumes of cheap unmanned systems and munitions to overwhelm more-sophisticated air and missile defenses,\u201d James Black, assistant director defense and security for the RAND Europe think tank, wrote in a blog post in January. DAPA said the Block-I weapon has been in development for five years, with more than $63 million invested. The Korea Institute for Defense Analyses led the system development with participation from Hanwha Aerospace, it said. The system was evaluated suitable for combat in April 2023 after achieving 100% success in shooting down targets in live-fire tests, according to DAPA. The agency said South Korea is the first country to publicly acknowledge it will deploy a mass-produced laser weapon. Earlier this year, Britain showed off a new laser weapon that its military says could deliver lethal missile or aircraft defense at around $13 a shot. But no possible deployment date for that weapon had been announced. In 2022, the US Navy successfully tested a high-energy laser system against a target representing a cruise missile. But a Navy account of that test said there was no plan to get it into the hands of warfighters, adding that it \u201coffers a glimpse into the future of laser weapons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/asia/south-korea-antidrone-lasers-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

Afghan refugees in Pakistan with Proof of Registration (POR) cards will be able to stay in the country until June 30, 2025, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s office said Wednesday. The fate of 1.45 million refugees whose PORs expired at the end of June had previously been in doubt, with many fearing they\u2019d be deported. News of the extension came one day after the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for refugees visited Afghanistan and urged Pakistan to extend the POR cards. \u201cGlad that Pakistan\u2019s tradition of hospitality is maintained,\u201d Filippo Grandi wrote on X Thursday.

Pakistan is home to one of the world\u2019s largest refugee populations \u2013 most of them from Afghanistan. But the country has not always welcomed Afghan refugees, subjecting them to hostile living conditions and threatening deportation over the years. More than 3 million Afghan refugees, including registered refugees and more than 800,000 undocumented people were living in Pakistan as of March 2024, according to UNHCR data. Some fled their home country decades ago during the Soviet invasion, while other Afghans sought refuge in Pakistan when the Taliban retook Afghanistan in 2021, implementing its oppressive rule. Last October, Pakistan gave undocumented Afghans weeks to leave or face deportation, claiming Afghan nationals carried out 14 of 24 major terrorist attacks in Pakistan last year.\u00a0Between September 15, 2023 and the end of June, about 650,000 Afghans had returned home, according to the UNHCR. Some 32,000 of them were deported. They\u2019re returning to a country under the control of a militant regime that has imposed a form of gender apartheid and where millions live in poverty.

Tom and Susan were on the same flight from the US to Ireland in the summer of 1989. But they never saw one another. Then, Tom and Susan were staying in the same hotel in Dromoland, County Clare, on Ireland\u2019s west coast. But they never crossed paths. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because the first thing I did when I arrived was take a walk, and everybody else went to bed \u2013 and now I know Sue also went for a walk,\u201d Tom tells CNN Travel today. But Tom and Susan walked in opposite directions, and so they remained strangers. The two Americans were visiting Ireland via the same organized tour company. But they were on separate tours, to opposite coasts. \u201cI was on the west coast of Ireland, she was going to the east coast of Ireland,\u201d says Tom. While the tours were heading in different directions, both began with a stop off at Bunratty Castle, a 15th-century tower house in County Clare. Inside the stone walls, the US visitors were treated to a banquet, accompanied by Irish musicians and interspersed with folk storytelling. But Tom and Susan didn\u2019t share a dinner table that evening. \u201cShe had the early dinner, I had the late dinner,\u201d says Tom. The two kept almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 meeting. And that was only the beginning. Looking back four years later, Tom felt this series of almost-meetings \u2013 and how they\u2019d eventually crossed paths, connected, reconnected and then dated \u2013 was all a bit \u201ccosmic.\u201d But then he and Susan broke up. And while the split was amicable, with no ill-feelings, they hadn\u2019t spoken since. \u201cStill, she was always in the back of my mind,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI dated those four years. But I didn\u2019t forget her, at all.\u201d It was during one of these moments of nostalgia that Tom spontaneously decided to call Susan. It was late 1993, Susan\u2019s birthday. Tom figured he\u2019d pass on some birthday wishes, and see where she was at in life. It was a bit daunting, keying those digits into his landline phone four years later, but Tom figured he had nothing to lose. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t even pick up. But she did. Tom\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he heard Susan\u2019s voice again. \u201cHey,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d A trip to Ireland Tom and Susan both joined the tour to Ireland in 1989 on the spur of the moment. Back then, Tom was in his early 30s. He was laser-focused on building his career, but also dreamed of traveling the world, at one point joining an airline travel club to try to get flight deals. \u201cEvery week they\u2019d send you a telegram, which would list flights they had for cheap. And you could sign up and leave the next weekend. Then this trip popped up,\u201d recalls Tom. \u201cIt was my first time in Europe. I\u2019d never been before. And so that\u2019s how I ended up in Ireland.\u201d As for Susan, she was a bit younger than Tom \u2013 in her 20s, still unsure what direction her life might take. \u201cI had just left a job,\u201d Susan tells CNN Travel today. \u201cAnd my mom and my older sister were hopping on this tour to Ireland, and I just decided to go with them \u2013 at the very last minute, probably with a week left or so. \u201cI had never really traveled that much before that. So it was very magical, to me, to go with them. That\u2019s how I ended up going on the tour.\u201d That first night in Ireland, Susan\u2019s tour party headed to Bunratty Castle for the early dinner. Afterward, they decamped to a nearby pub, Durty Nelly\u2019s, a yellow, thatched-roof building in the shadow of the castle\u2019s towers. Inside, tourists sampling Guinness mixed with pub regulars, including an older man playing an accordion and singing. Susan watched him play and, in between sips of her pint, cheered along with the music. The evening \u2013 with the castle, the dinner, the pub, the music \u2013 felt like the perfect start to her vacation. \u201cI thought Ireland was so incredible,\u201d says Susan. \u201cIt was so green and just beautiful. I thought the people were really friendly.\u201d When the accordion player finished a song, Susan took the opportunity to find the restroom. She was searching through the low-roofed building when she collided with a tall guy. Susan remembers meeting his eyes and being struck by him right away. This \u2013 of course \u2013 was Tom. \u201cI thought he was handsome,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cVery cute.\u201d \u201cShe thought I was Irish,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI did think he was Irish,\u201d recalls Susan, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019d had a few drinks. We just spoke really briefly.\u201d Over the noise of the other pub revelers, Susan and Tom chatted about the banquet dinner at Bunratty Castle. Tom mentioned his group were heading there shortly, and Susan realized he was also an American tourist. \u201cI told him the dinner was fun,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cAnd that was pretty much it.\u201d As Susan descended into the throngs of people in the pub \u2013 still hunting for the restroom \u2013 Tom watched her walk away. \u201cShe was obviously beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s 5 feet 9. Beautiful. She caught my attention.\u201d Over the next few days, as Susan toured the east coast of Ireland \u2013 admiring castles, craggy landscapes and beaches \u2013 she thought about Tom a little bit, half wondering if they might run into each other again. \u201cHe definitely made an impression,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought he was really cute, handsome.\u201d And on the other side of the country, Tom, in between admiring \u201cthe greenest countryside and endless stone walls along the roads,\u201d also found his thoughts turning to the woman he\u2019d run into at the pub. \u201cI thought about Susan too,\u201d says Tom. \u201cBut I never thought I\u2019d run into her, because she said she was on the other coast.\u201d A second meeting When her Irish tour concluded, Susan boarded a plane home to the US at Dublin Airport, along with her mother and sister. After filling up half the aircraft in Dublin, the plane then stopped over at Shannon Airport to collect more passengers. Among them: Tom. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we saw each other for the second time,\u201d says Tom. As he boarded the aircraft, Tom spotted a glimpse of Susan, already seated. Later, he got up to stretch his legs and walked past Susan, who was sitting with her mother and sister. \u201cHe stopped for a minute to talk to us. And we made some small talk,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cI was very surprised to see him and a little flustered too.\u201d A few hours later, the airplane halfway across the Atlantic, Tom and Susan ended up in the restroom line together. They talked a bit about their time in Ireland. There was something between them, they both felt it. And as they chatted, Susan wondered if Tom might ask for her number. \u201cI was hoping he would and was disappointed when he didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought that was it.\u201d Tom wanted to ask Susan out. He almost did, there and then. But he worried he\u2019d misread the signs, and he didn\u2019t want to make the atmosphere on board awkward. So he said nothing. As soon as he sat back down in his seat, Tom regretted this decision. \u201cBut we\u2019ll probably see each other in customs,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her out when I see her at JFK.\u201d As soon as the airplane landed in New York, Tom realized this was never going to happen. The airport arrivals area was huge, and packed with people. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been to JFK customs, that thing\u2019s like three football fields long,\u201d says Tom. \u201cSo, needless to say, I didn\u2019t see her. So I didn\u2019t ask her out.\u201d Swallowing his disappointment, Tom focused on getting through the customs line and getting to the bus stop. He was heading back to his home in Pennsylvania a couple of hours away. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll never see her again,\u201d he thought, as he grabbed his bag from the luggage carousel and exited the building. After all, it was 1989. There was no option to look Susan up on social media \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know her last name anyway. Tom walked out of the building, he glanced around and spotted the bus stop. There was a bus that looked ready to leave. Tom started running, hopeful he might just make it. \u201cAnd as I was running to the bus, there she was \u2013 standing with her mom and sister, just getting ready to get on another bus,\u201d says Tom. Tom couldn\u2019t believe it. And Susan, about to board, couldn\u2019t believe it either. Tom reached Susan just in time. Slightly breathless, he dug out a business card from his pocket and passed it to her. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018if I saw you one more time, I\u2019d give you my card,\u2019\u201d said Tom. \u201cCall me.\u201d Susan \u2013 feeling slightly giddy in disbelief \u2013 took the card. A first date Back home in New Jersey, Susan played it cool and didn\u2019t call Tom right away. But while she was trying to project nonchalance, internally she was thrilled. \u201cI just remember being so excited,\u201d she says today. \u201cWhen he gave me his card, he didn\u2019t really have time to talk to me because he had to catch the bus. And I was just like, \u2018Oh my gosh.\u2019 He went his way, I went mine. Eventually I called him a few weeks later.\u201d Tom and Susan lived around two hours from one another, in neighboring states. Talking on the phone, the two decided Tom would come to New Jersey, and they agreed to go to an Irish pub. It felt appropriate, given where they\u2019d first met. \u201cI was very excited to call him and very nervous,\u201d Susan recalls. \u201cAnd then it was exciting seeing each other again. We each brought our Ireland photos and exchanged stories of our trips. We went to an Irish pub and played darts.\u201d From there, Tom and Susan started dating. Over the next few months, they saw one another pretty regularly. But then things started to dwindle. While they both really liked one another, it was clear they were in different stages of life. \u201cI just wanted to go out and have fun. Tom was very focused on advancing in his career,\u201d says Susan. \u201cThe timing was off.\u201d They went their separate ways. Cut to late 1993, when Tom called Susan out of the blue, on her birthday. Susan was pretty thrown when she heard his voice again. But it was good to hear from him, nice to speak with him. They talked for a little while. Then, Tom asked Susan if she\u2019d be interested in meeting up sometime. Susan hesitated. \u201cI was seeing someone else at the time,\u201d says Susan. \u201cI was in the process of breaking off that relationship. The timing just wasn\u2019t great.\u201d She said no. But in the weeks that followed, Susan \u2013 now officially single \u2013\u00a0found herself regretting turning Tom down. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, I really liked that guy. I really messed that up,\u201d she says. Susan confided in her mother, who\u2019d always liked Tom \u2013 she\u2019d never quite forgotten the joy on Susan\u2019s face when Tom found her at the JFK bus stop. \u2018My mom said, \u2018Listen, just call him. He\u2019s either going to say yes or no, you have nothing to lose, just call him and see what happens.\u2019\u201d So eventually, Susan called Tom. She invited him to join her as her date at a friend\u2019s black tie New Year\u2019s Eve party. Tom said yes. \u201cI was thrilled,\u201d he says today. \u201cI was thrilled Tom agreed to go with me,\u201d says Susan. \u201cHe picked me up at my family home. I walked down the stairs and he was standing there in black tie looking incredibly handsome.\u201d \u201cShe looked stunning coming down the stairs,\u201d recalls Tom. \u201cI knew I was a goner.\u201d The party was hosted by one of Susan\u2019s colleagues. When Susan turned up with Tom, her coworkers told he was a \u201cdefinite keeper.\u201d \u201cWe had a really great time at the party,\u201d says Susan. \u201cWe started dating from there.\u201d Timing aligned For Susan and Tom, timing seemed to have finally aligned. \u201cAfter we started dating the second time, I figured she had to be the one,\u201d says Tom. \u201cWe were definitely soulmates,\u201d says Susan. \u201cBut also, timing has to be there, too. So once the timing was there, we really realized that, \u2018This is the person.\u2019\u201d A few months later, in the spring of 1994, Tom and Susan returned to Europe together. \u201cWe started out in London and drove to Scotland,\u201d Susan recalls. She had a feeling Tom might propose on the trip. And she was right. \u201cI had the ring ready,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI was waiting for the perfect opportunity.\u201d In Scotland, the couple stayed at Culcreuch Castle, near Loch Lomond. At the time, the castle doubled as a hotel. It was a little reminiscent of Bunratty Castle, and Tom decided it was the perfect spot for the proposal. \u201cHe arranged for the ring to be put on top of my dessert after dinner at the castle,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cThe staff was so lovely, they played Marvin Gaye for us.\u201d Tom and Susan planned their wedding celebrations for June 1995. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t want to wait and ended up eloping to Las Vegas on November 22, 1994,\u201d says Susan. \u201cIt was crazy and super fun. We ended up having a vow renewal and reception at our original reception spot in June of 1995.\u201d A year later, Tom and Susan \u2013 who took Tom\u2019s name, becoming Susan Giuliani \u2013 welcomed a son, Evan. And in 1999, their daughter Paige was born. \u201cWe were so excited to start a family together,\u201d says Susan. When their kids were 10 and 12, Tom and Susan returned to Ireland. They called into Durty Nelly\u2019s, the place they\u2019d met 20 years previously and told the manager their story. Susan couldn\u2019t believe it when she realized the same accordion player was still there, still playing. \u201cWe were so excited to share with our children where we first met,\u201d says Susan. 35 years later Today, Susan and Tom are retired and living in New Jersey, focused on family and travels. They\u2019re currently planning an extended trip to Ireland next year and intend to once again return to the site of their first meeting. In the meantime, they\u2019re making travel plans for their 30th wedding anniversary this year \u2013 they\u2019ll be heading on a river cruise followed by a transatlantic cruise. Susan will chronicle the trip on her social media account. She started posting regularly in 2022, under the handle @suzanhall.overfiftygenx. For Susan, Instagram and Tiktok have become unexpected creative outlets. \u201cIt has really given me an opportunity to express myself and talk about the things I enjoy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve monetized my account and feel incredibly proud of what I have accomplished with it.\u201d Occasionally Tom helps Susan film her posts. She calls him her \u201cbiggest cheerleader and best friend.\u201d It\u2019s for this, and many other reasons, that Susan and Tom are thankful timing eventually aligned for them. They can\u2019t imagine a world in which they didn\u2019t cross paths in Ireland, didn\u2019t spot one another in JFK airport, didn\u2019t reconnect four years later. \u201cThe timing of getting out of customs at the right time to see Susan\u2026It\u2019s the cosmos at work\u2026\u201d reflects Tom. \u201cI believe that things happen for a reason,\u201d says Susan. \u201cAnd the timing has to be right \u2013 somebody could be your soulmate, could be the right person for you. But if you\u2019re not at a place in your life for you to receive that, or see that, then you might just miss your soulmate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/irish-pub-reconnected-romance-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

The drone attack took place in a settlement in the Podgorensky district, Voronezh governor Aleksandr Gusev said Sunday. Ukrainian sources said the warehouse was targeted because it was being used to supply ammunition to Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. \u201cSeveral UAVs were detected and destroyed by on-duty air defense forces over the territory of the Voronezh region last night. A fire broke out at a warehouse due to the fall of their wreckage. Detonation of explosive items began in the Podgorensky district,\u201d Gusev said. He did not identify the settlement where the attack took place, but said a state of emergency had been declared there. No one was injured in the attack, but two elderly women were taken to hospital for checks, he said. \u201cOperational services, military and officials are working on the site to eliminate the emergency,\u201d he said, adding arrangements have been made for the evacuation of residents from nearby villages as well. \u201cSo far, some 50 people from three settlements have been transported to temporary accommodation centers. We are providing them with all the necessary assistance,\u201d he said. A Ukrainian source familiar with the matter said drones of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) targeted the warehouse because it was being used to supply ammunition to Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. \u201cThe enemy was storing surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, shells for tanks and artillery, and boxes of ammunition for firearms on an area of 9,000 square meters,\u201d the source said. CNN is not able to independently verify those claims. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a state broadcaster following the attack that \u201cthe president has said that we would respond \u2013 and I am convinced that you will see it in the foreseeable future.\u201d \u201cThey \u2013 the United States and NATO \u2013 keep on saying that they are not at war with Russia. This is not a brave face on a bad situation, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll say, and they understand it perfectly well,\u201d Lavrov said, according to state news agency TASS. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said on Sunday that Ukrainian drone attacks had also been intercepted Saturday night in the border region of Belgorod. Meanwhile, Russian attacks in Ukraine also continued on Sunday, injuring at least two people in the Kharkiv region, according to local authorities.

The search for Kyle Clifford, 26, began on Tuesday evening when police were called to a house in Bushey, Hertfordshire, where they found three seriously injured women. Carol Hunt, 61, wife of BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, later died from their wounds, according to statements Wednesday from police and Britain\u2019s public broadcaster. A crossbow is believed to have been used in the \u201ctargeted incident,\u201d police said, adding that other weapons may also have been used. Clifford, who police warned may have been armed with a crossbow, was found in Enfield, North London on Wednesday afternoon, Hertfordshire Police said in a statement. \u201cA man wanted in connection with a triple murder in\u00a0Bushey\u00a0has been traced to a location in North London. Following an extensive search, Kyle Clifford, aged 26, was found in the\u00a0Enfield area by officers this afternoon (Wednesday, July 10),\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt this stage, we believe the suspect was known to the victims.\u201d The suspect is hospitalized in a serious condition and is yet to speak with officers, police said in an update Thursday. Clifford left the British army in 2022 after a short period of service, a source in the British defense ministry told CNN. He joined the forces in 2019 and served in the Household Cavalry, his former military boss told CNN. The killings sent shock waves through Britain, where mass murders are rare but violence against women has been labeled a national threat by the government. A woman is killed by a man every three days in the United Kingdom and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem, said earlier this year. \u201cEntrenched patriarchy at almost every level of society, combined with a rise in misogyny that permeates the physical and online world, is denying thousands of women and girls across the UK the right to live in safety, free from fear and violence,\u201d Alsalem said in February. \u2018Utterly devastating\u2019 The BBC\u00a0described the women\u2019s killings as \u201cutterly devastating\u201d in a statement to staff. The\u00a0broadcaster said it would give Hunt \u201call the support we can\u201d as part of a note sent to\u00a0BBC\u00a0Radio 5 Live staff. \u201cThe news today about John Hunt\u2019s family is utterly devastating,\u201d it said. \u201cOur thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\u201d British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper expressed her condolences following the killings. \u201cThe loss of three women\u2019s lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community,\u201d Cooper wrote on X Wednesday. \u201cI am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support Hertfordshire Police with any information about this case.\u201d A neighbor of the women said she \u201cwould see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\u201d according to PA Media. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad what\u2019s happened, very shocking,\u201d she added. In Britain, it is legal for a person to buy or own a crossbow if they are over 18, though anyone who carries one in public without a reasonable excuse can face imprisonment. In February, the previous government launched an eight-week review of the rules and the possibility of introducing a licensing scheme.

{"id": "2024_07_09_asia_korea-ac130j-ghostrider-gunship-biggest-gun-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "As the US Air Force AC-130J flies over South Korea\u2019s towering apartment blocks, its powerful cameras can almost see inside\u00a0windows on the highest floors. Aiming farther afield, the weapons officers on the four-engine aircraft, nicknamed Ghostrider, can pick out objects at 50,000 feet, almost 10 miles away \u2013 all potential targets for the biggest gun ever mounted on a fixed-wing plane. CNN got an exclusive look inside the aircraft, assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command, in early June after it flew from its home base in Hurlburt Field, Florida, for joint drills in South Korea. In a live-fire exercise, the 105-millimeter howitzer pumped out 43-pound shells, into a firing range east of Seoul, the force of each blast so powerful that it pushed the tail of the 80-ton plane six feet to the right. About eight seconds after firing, the shells hit the range 10,000 feet below, sending smoke billowing skyward as the controllers of the big gun watched the results of their handiwork on large video screens in the middle of the aircraft. \u201cAssess two tanks destroyed,\u201d a scratchy voice confirms in the radio headsets of the AC-130 crew. Pilot Capt. John Ikenberry said the AC-130\u2019s presence for drills in South Korea was designed to send a simple message to its belligerent neighbor North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. \u201cIt shows we are ready,\u201d Ikenberry said. Tensions have been simmering on the peninsula in recent months. The North has been sending balloons filled with trash to areas in and near Seoul and testing missiles, and South Korean troops have fired warning shots as North Korean soldiers from the North have crossed the military demarcation line in the middle of the demilitarized zone. Just this week, North Korea criticized live-fire exercises in the South in late June and early July as an \u201c\u2018inexcusable and explicit provocation.\u201d Meanwhile, Washington has kept a steady stream of hardware heading to the South for land, air and sea exercises leading up to one of their biggest yearly exercises, Ulchi Freedom Shield, set to begin later this summer. Experience they can\u2019t get stateside The AC-130J, the newest version of the US Air Force Hercules gunships, is testing its mettle in Korea for the second year in a row. Maj. Heath Curtis, combat systems officer on the Hercules, says it\u2019s important for the gunship to make the flight across the Pacific because it offers experience training where a conflict could be fought with conditions that can\u2019t be duplicated on firing ranges in Florida or New Mexico that the gunship would use in the United States. The mountain ranges and ridges of the Korean Peninsula present wind conditions not found elsewhere, he says, and that can make a difference even to a projectile traveling more than 800 mph. It also gives the chance for Curtis and a second officer seated at AC-130\u2019s weapons control center the chance to practice alongside South Korean allies they may need to protect in the event of a ground war on the peninsula. The huge television monitors bring the battlefield below up close in both regular and infrared definition. The cameras mounted outside the plane can zoom in on details to ensure weapons fire is accurate. \u201cThe unique thing about the AC-130 is the amount of fire that we bring, the amount of munitions \u2013 the diverse amount of them \u2013 and the amount of loiter time we can provide,\u201d says the mission commander for this gunship, Maj. Josh Burris. Besides the 105-millimeter howitzer, the AC-130J carries a 30-millimeter cannon and can launch precision-guided missiles and bombs from pylons on its wings. With the weapons\u2019 near-pinpoint accuracy, it can fire on enemy positions within shouting distance of friendly troops, earning the aircraft the title of \u201cthe infantryman\u2019s best friend\u201d in some circles. And with air-to-air refueling, it can, in theory, stay on station supporting ground forces as long as the crew and ammunition can last. \u2018Spooky\u2019 history US Air Force gunships trace their lineage back to the Vietnam War, when the service set up 7.62 mm guns to fire out one side of a C-47 transport aircraft. With that configuration, the aircraft could circle a single point and deliver massive, continuous firepower on it, from its guns that could fire 6,000 rounds in a minute, according to Air Force fact sheets. The firepower and the flares they used to light up targets during night missions earned them the nicknames \u201cSpooky\u201d and \u201cPuff the Magic Dragon.\u201d As the war went on, the Air Force looked for a heavier airframe for the gunship role and turned to C-130 Hercules transports. The first conversion of a C-130 to an AC-130 saw action over Southeast Asia in 1967, according to the National Museum of the US Air Force. With their ability to support troops in close combat, AC-130 gunships in different variations have seen action in conflicts including Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan and have saved an untold number of lives, according to the Air Force. With the AC-130J model, introduced in 2017, the Air Force removed the machine guns in favor of the more precision-guided munitions. But there have been problems, too, including a 2015 attack on a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, that killed left 42 patients, staff and caretakersdead. Despite the formidable firepower it carries, the AC-130 flies low and slow, making it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. And seven AC-130 gunships have been lost over the years, the last being on January 31, 1991, when an Iraqi surface-to-air missile brought down a AC-130H during Operation Desert Storm, according to Air Force news releases. The plane crashed into the Persian Gulf while supporting US Marines during a battle in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, killing all 14 crew aboard. The AC-130\u2019s crew acknowledges the dangers of ground fire to their aircraft, and some analysts question its usefulness in any potential conflict with North Korea. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t be operated within say 100 nautical miles of the border as they\u2019re too vulnerable to North Korean border air defenses,\u201d says Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. But Layton says the gunships could be helpful supporting allied troops who might be trying to round up North Korean special forces units that had managed to infiltrate deeper into southern territory. Still, he cautioned, \u201cif a war starts there, try not to be on an AC-130 unless it\u2019s heading out of theater.\u201d Maj. Christopher Mesnard, Special Operations Command Korea public affairs director, said the AC-130J is a suitable weapon system for the Korean Peninisula. \u201cWe have the utmost confidence in our ability to operate weapons systems\u00a0\u200blike the AC-130J in times and places of our choosing and in a way that adequately considers risks, regardless of the region,\u201d he said.

France\u2019s vote, which Macron unexpectedly called after his party was trounced by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party in last month\u2019s European elections, has tipped France into political limbo, after none of the three main blocs came close to forming an absolute majority. In an open letter to the French people published Wednesday, Macron called on parties with \u201crepublican values\u201d \u2013 understood to exclude parties on the far left and far right \u2013 to form a coalition large enough to pass laws in parliament. Macron\u2019s comments suggest he is unwilling to work with the more extreme part of the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition, which secured the most seats in the French parliament in Sunday\u2019s second-round vote, but not enough to govern independently. \u201cI call on all political forces that recognize themselves in republican institutions, the rule of law, parliamentarianism, a European orientation and the defense of French independence, to engage in sincere and loyal dialogue to build a solid majority, necessarily plural, for the country,\u201d wrote Macron. Macron said it was \u201cin light of these principles\u201d that he will decide on the appointment of France\u2019s next prime minister. \u201cThis means giving the political forces a little time to build these compromises with serenity and respect for each other,\u201d he said. The NFP won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group in the 577-seat parliament. Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which trailed in a distant third in the first round, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. And the RN and its allies, despite leading the first round, won 143 seats. It is customary for the French president to appoint a prime minister from the largest parliamentary group \u2013 in this case the NFP \u2013 and ask it to form a government. But Macron and his Ensemble allies have repeatedly refused to enter into coalition with the far-left France Unbowed, the largest single party within the NFP, and have accused its leader, the 72-year-old firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, of being just as extreme and unfit to govern as figures on the far right. The NFP formed days after Macron called the snap vote, and chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. After tactical voting and political bargaining between centrist and left-wing voters, the NFP managed the same feat in Sunday\u2019s second round. But the NFP does not speak with a single voice. The various parties in the coalition straddle vast ideological ground, from the far-left France Unbowed to the more moderate Place Publique and Socialist parties. When the shock result was announced, each party celebrated separately, and the bloc still has not nominated a leader to become prime minister. M\u00e9lenchon has stated his intention to govern France. In a victory speech Sunday evening near Stalingrad Square in Paris, he said Macron \u201chas the duty\u201d to ask the NFP to form a government. Unlike its neighbors Italy and Germany, France \u2013 with its presidential system \u2013 lacks the culture of coalition-building and compromise, meaning the formation of a new government could take weeks and prove fleeting. Newly-elected members of parliament, called \u201cdeputies,\u201d are scheduled to take their seats for the first time on July 18. But without a clear majority, a minority government faces the risk of no-confidence votes, which could lead to several governments replacing each other in quick succession. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal\u2019s offer to resign was on Monday rejected by Macron, leaving him in place in a caretaker role until the new government is formed. \u201cThe current government will continue to exercise its responsibilities, then take care of day-to-day business in accordance with republican tradition,\u201d Macron said, in an attempt to calm the situation two weeks out from the Olympic Games\u2019 opening ceremony in Paris.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/europe/macron-france-mainstream-coalition-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_tech_apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets", "text": "Apple has yielded to pressure by European regulators to give rivals access to the contactless payments technology on iPhones, meaning that their users will no longer be limited to the Apple Pay mobile wallet. The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_europe_russia-shadow-war-nato-intl-latam", "text": "Arson at warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine. Surveillance cameras where NATO trains Ukrainian troops. Blunt vandalism of ministerial cars. Even an apparent, failed bomb plot. Russia has been engaged in a \u201cbold\u201d sabotage operation across NATO\u2019s member states for\u00a0more than six\u00a0months, targeting the supply lines of weapons for Ukraine and the decision-makers behind it, according to a senior NATO official. Multiple security officials across Europe describe a threat that is metastasizing as Russian agents, increasingly under scrutiny by security services and\u00a0frustrated in their own operations, hire local amateurs to undertake high-risk, and often deniable, crimes on their behalf. The NATO official said they had observed \u201can unprecedented escalation and spread of Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare\u201d over the past six months, which included \u201cphysical sabotage\u201d on the supply line of NATO weapons intended for Ukraine. \u201cIt is everything from point of production and origin, to storage, to those who are making decisions, to the actual\u00a0delivery,\u201d the\u00a0senior NATO official said. \u201cIt is bold. Russia is attempting to intimidate\u00a0(our)\u00a0allies.\u201d Russia has dismissed the claims as unfounded but\u00a0Russian sabotage and hybrid warfare will be on the agenda of the NATO 75th anniversary meeting in Washington, DC,\u00a0which began Tuesday. Yet it is unclear how publicly member states will express their outrage at what analysts have called the Kremlin\u2019s new \u201cshadow\u00a0war,\u201d as they may be\u00a0reluctant to provide Moscow with a propaganda win, or foment alarm at a series of security breaches across Europe. Recent high-profile arrests have revealed the ad-hoc, clumsy nature of how the Kremlin\u2019s intelligence operations have evolved since the start of the war in\u00a0Ukraine. Last year, 14\u00a0Ukrainians and two Belarusians\u00a0were arrested in Poland in one case on suspicion of\u00a0working for Russian intelligence. A Ukrainian, who under Polish privacy law can be identified only as Maxim L., 24, was sentenced to\u00a0six\u00a0years\u00a0after weeks of receiving tasks from a Russian handler, Andrzej,\u00a0whom he had never physically met but encountered on the Telegram messaging app in February 2023. Andrzej at first paid him $7 in digital currencies for spraying anti-war graffiti around Poland, Maxim said. Yet the tasks soon became darker. \u2018Easy money\u2026 it seemed so insignificant\u2019 In a rare interview with CNN inside the maximum-security wing of Lublin prison, Maxim said he had fled Ukraine to Poland in a frustrated bid to escape\u00a0unemployment and poverty. \u201cIt was easy\u00a0money,\u201d he\u00a0said of the work Andrzej offered. \u201cI needed money badly.\u201d He said he did not feel an obligation to fight for Ukraine after the Russian invasion\u00a0in\u00a0February 2022. \u201cThat country has never done anything for\u00a0me,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that just because you are born in a certain country, you have to go to war for it. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I am not pro-Russian, I am not pro-Ukraine. I am not pro-anything.\u201d Andrzej soon started sending Maxim location pins where he should plant surveillance cameras along the railway tracks near the border town of Medyka, through which military and humanitarian aid would flow to Ukraine. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any of it could cause any actual harm. It seemed so insignificant,\u201d he\u00a0said. Andrzej later asked him to burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company in the eastern Polish town of Biala Podlaska, he said, which Maxim says he faked,\u00a0taking a photograph of the fence with lumps of coal he had placed to mimic fire damage. Yet Maxim\u2019s slow realization that Andrzej was a Russian agent became complete, he said, when he was told to put cameras outside a base where Poland was training Ukrainian soldiers. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew it could be\u00a0serious,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cIt made me feel uneasy. That was when I decided I\u2019d quit. But I never got a chance. I got arrested the\u00a0next day.\u201d Polish internal security agents arrested Maxim on March 3, 2023, after weeks of surveillance, sparked partially by the discovery of a gas station receipt Maxim had accidentally dropped on one of his operations,\u00a0according to a Polish official.\u00a0Multiple other arrests followed this, making it the largest\u00a0known\u00a0Russian espionage operation in Poland of recent times, raising concerns in Warsaw about the extent of Moscow\u2019s infiltration. Two Russian citizens were\u00a0detained\u00a0last August\u00a0on suspicion of\u00a0recruiting to Wagner\u00a0and a Polish\u00a0man and two Belarusians this May for\u00a0alleged\u00a0arson. Another Polish man was arrested in April 2024 for possessing ammunition, and surveilling Rzeszow Jasionka airport, a hub for moving NATO arms to Kyiv, in a suspected plot to assassinate Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also frequently uses the facility. The Polish plots join a series of incidents across Europe which, when viewed together,\u00a0portray\u00a0the widescale ambition of Moscow\u2019s operations.\u00a0Russia was \u201clikely\u201d behind an arson attack that hit Poland\u2019s largest shopping\u00a0center\u00a0in May, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, and suspicions have been voiced about another fire at an ammunition factory, south of the capital, in June. Czech officials have voiced concerns at Russian involvement in the hacking and disruption of its railways last year. Last month, a suspicious fire hit a metals factory for a defense manufacturer outside Berlin, and a\u00a026-year-old\u00a0pro-Russian\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0was arrested after blowing himself up with a\u00a0homemade\u00a0bomb near\u00a0Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.\u00a0A\u00a0warehouse\u00a0fire in East London in March led to\u00a0two men\u00a0being charged by London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service with arson and assisting a foreign intelligence service, namely Russia. While the incidents have not all been definitively linked to Russian intelligence, they have been unified by the apparent involvement of amateurs, or petty criminality aimed at spreading fear or disruption. A \u2018pretty dangerous game\u2019 The senior NATO official said Russian sabotage on NATO states amounted to a \u201cpretty dangerous game, if\u00a0(Russia believes)\u00a0these things are always below the threshold of armed conflict,\u201d that\u00a0would not trigger the NATO\u00a0Article 5\u00a0stipulation that an attack on one member state is an attack on the entire alliance. \u201cFinding where that line is, is a difficult and dangerous calculation to make,\u201d the official said, adding that\u00a0Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u2019s beleaguered invasion of Ukraine shows the Kremlin head was not always getting good military advice. Russia is using the \u201cfull gamut\u201d of hybrid operations, the official added. \u201cWe see everything from high-end operations in Europe, where we have seen as much as 400,000 euros ($433,000) paid for some type of intelligence activity, to some places where thugs are being hired for a couple of thousand\u00a0euros.\u201d A similar threat\u00a0has grown\u00a0on Russia\u2019s border with NATO, in Estonia, where 10\u00a0suspected Russian agents were arrested\u00a0in February after the interior minister\u2019s car was vandalized. The incident was a high-profile peak in what Estonian officials have said is a years-long campaign by Moscow to destabilize its tiny\u00a0NATO\u00a0neighbor, about a fifth\u00a0of whose population of 1.3 million is Russian-speaking,\u00a0according to a 2021 analysis by the EU. Recent months have seen GPS jamming impede civilian aircraft landings, and even the buoys that demark part of Russia\u2019s border with Estonia disappear, amid a short-lived call from Moscow for the maritime frontiers to be reassessed. Harrys Puusepp, a spokesman for the KAPO, Estonia\u2019s internal security service, told CNN that Russian activities had escalated over recent months. \u201cWe saw a significant rise in their activity in the last autumn, and by winter, we were able to apprehend more than\u00a010 (suspects).\u00a0The number has grown by now \u2013 persons who were involved in their hybrid activities against Estonian security \u2013 in a kind that we hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d He said the operations were moving \u201ctowards physical attacks\u201d and suggested the war in Ukraine might lead to more aggressive Russian tactics in the months ahead, if operatives were redeployed to the Baltic areas from the war. \u201cWe have to face the facts. Russia is big enough to have resources to fight a war against Ukraine and also maintain its security operations against European countries\u2026 against us. There are people who take part in the war against Ukraine, and then they are rotated to some other region or area. They have more experience. Their mindset is more violent. They are perhaps not so patient anymore trying to get results.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/europe/russia-shadow-war-nato-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_weather_houston-texas-power-outages-heat-friday", "text": "Half a million Houston-area homes and businesses may not have their power restored until next week amid sweltering summer heat, even as many in the region struggle to access fresh food, air conditioning and safe drinking water. More than 1 million power customers in southeast Texas \u2013 mainly between Galveston and north of Houston \u2013 are still without power after Hurricane Beryl hurtled into the Gulf Coast on Monday, leaving at least 10 people dead in Texas, two dead in Vermont and one dead in Louisiana. The outages have debilitated infrastructure across the region, including hospitals, assisted living facilities and water treatment plants, leading to mounting frustrations from residents that Houston\u2019s main utility, CenterPoint Energy, was not more prepared for the storm. Though the utility is racing to make repairs, a CenterPoint executive said roughly 500,000 customers will not have electrical power restored until sometime next week. The fatal destruction wrought by Hurricane Beryl extended to Vermont, where more than 100 people in Vermont had to be rescued. Two people were found dead in floodwaters there after the storm brought dramatic flooding to the state on Wednesday. John Rice, 73, was found dead Thursday after he drove into a flooded street in Lyndonville, and a current washed the car off the road into a hay field flooded with 10 feet of water, Lyndonville Police Chief Jack T. Harris told CNN in an email. The body of Dylan Kempton, 33, was also recovered from floodwaters early Thursday morning by first responders, according to a\u00a0Vermont State Police news release. He was riding a UTV that was washed off the road when a culvert breached. In Texas, the sustained power outages and devastating heat come even as many residents face substantial repairs of homes damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Beryl and the disastrous flooding it wrought along the coast. Waters were still receding from some coastal communities and roadways on Thursday, Texas Emergency Management Chief\u00a0Nim\u00a0Kidd said in a news conference. Houston area resident Frankie Thibideaux said her home remained swamped with water for days and became moldy in the heat. After two days, the 57-year-old couldn\u2019t stand to stay there any longer and left the residential building in Missouri City to stay in a hotel. \u201cWe can\u2019t live in a place like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t even let my dog live like those people are.\u201d The conditions have had life-threatening \u2013 and at times deadly \u2013 consequences. A 71-year-old woman died near Crystal Beach after her oxygen machine ran out of battery power and her generator shut down. And at least two people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Harris County, where fire departments have responded to more than 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls from people attempting to use generators. Scores of homes are also without drinking water as storm damage and power outages have left 135 wastewater treatment plants offline, according to Kidd. Boil water notices stretch across eight counties in the Houston and Galveston areas, he added, noting water is being distributed across impacted communities. Adding to residents\u2019 distress are 90-degree temperatures that have baked the area every day this week and will continue into next week. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels under both heat and humidity \u2013 could reach\u00a0106 degrees\u00a0in some areas Friday, a life-threatening scenario for people without adequate cooling. Tensions are running high as people become desperate for relief. Fort Bend County Sheriff Eric Fagan called for calm after the department received a report a man pulled a gun on a CenterPoint Energy worker \u2013 behavior the sheriff\u2019s office \u201cwill not tolerate.\u201d A dozen Houston area hospitals are in a state of \u201cinternal disaster\u201d and more than 40 dialysis clinics are struggling with outages, Kidd said. City officials are working to move dialysis patients to other locations and distribute generators to in-need facilities \u201cas fast as possible,\u201d he added. After Houston area hospitals determined it would be unsafe to discharge patients to homes without power, several locations became backed up, prompting city officials to organize overflow beds in an indoor sports stadium, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said Tuesday. Residents who are elderly or suffer from chronic illnesses are particularly at risk for heat-related illnesses, creating a dire scenario for the network of nursing homes and assisted living facilities still without power in the Houston area. Some such facilities are relying on an improvised patchwork of portable A/Cs and generators to protect their most vulnerable residents, some of whom rely on electronic medical devices to live. \u201cEvery day, it just seems to get worse and worse and worse,\u201d said Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of CrowdSource Rescue, a non-profit founded during Hurricane Harvey primarily serving as a search-and-rescue group. Marchetti\u2019s group of volunteers has helped deliver generators and supplies to 16 independent living facilities for seniors, but they\u2019ve identified roughly 120 facilities in need of help. \u201cThe whole city is hurting and suffering. That\u2019s what it feels like right now, from my vantage point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think for the seniors, they\u2019re taking the brunt of it. So we\u2019re trying to do everything we can.\u201d Martin Cominsky, President and CEO of Interfaith Ministries for Greater Houston, oversees the Meals on Wheels program in the area, which serves 4,500 people over the age of 60 with hot meals every day. He said most of their clients don\u2019t have power right now, and staff who deliver food are offering their own cell phones to help seniors connect with loved ones, since many of their phones are dead. \u201cWe keep going back day after day,\u201d he said. \u201cNo job is too small or too hard in times like these.\u201d Utility faces barrage of criticism Houston\u2019s primary utility company, CenterPoint Energy, is responsible for a majority of the outages and is fielding growing frustration from residents and local officials who say the utility should have been more prepared for the storm. Though the utility said it had restored service to more than 1.3 million customers by Thursday night, roughly 500,000 will remain in the dark until sometime next week, according to a CenterPoint Energy executive who spoke Thursday before the Texas Public Utility Commission. The homes and businesses most deeply affected by the outage are those suffering massive electrical infrastructure damage from Hurricane Beryl, including the southern side of Houston and up through the Interstate 45 corridor, said Jason Ryan, one of the utility\u2019s executive vice presidents. \u201cWe know we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cI know customers are frustrated.\u201d Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has requested an investigation into how CenterPoint and other power companies responded to Hurricane Beryl, Patrick, the lieutenant governor, said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will find that there are things they could have done better,\u201d Patrick said. Some residents have complained of a lack of communication from the utility, leaving people with little idea when they will have power again. The company responded to customer complaints its outage map shows areas have power when, in reality, they don\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re working on the accuracy right now,\u201d CenterPoint Vice President of Operations Darin Carroll told CNN affiliate KHOU. \u201cWe track it constantly. We\u2019re making adjustments to the map as we speak. The other thing I want customers to know is even if you see yourself in that green on the map, don\u2019t worry; we know you\u2019re out of power, and we are gonna get to you.\u201d In an interview with the Houston Chronicle, CenterPoint CEO Jason Wells said he is proud of the progress the company has made toward restoration but acknowledged customers\u2019 frustrations about not knowing when they will have power again. \u201cI think we could do a better job of communicating expectations with our customers, and I personally own that,\u201d Wells told the Chronicle. CNN has reached out to CenterPoint Energy for comment. Ryan, the CenterPoint Energy executive, said the company started tracking Hurricane Beryl nine days before the storm made landfall. Just after July 4, days before the storm hit the Texas coast, the company put out its first request for 3,000 \u201cmutual assistance\u201d workers to pre-position ahead of the storm. As the path of the storm shifted closer to the Houston area before landfall, CenterPoint increased the request to 10,000, he said. In response to growing anger toward CenterPoint, several members of the Texas Public Utility Commission urged the utility\u2019s leadership to improve its communication and \u201crebuilding trust\u201d with customers in the hurricane-damaged areas. \u201cInfrastructure is going to break. Things are going to happen. But if people feel like they\u2019re being effectively communicated with, it makes it a lot easier to go through. And so, I\u2019d say get out into the community and go talk to your customers,\u201d said commission chairman Thomas Gleeson. The ongoing outages have also prompted renewed discussions about Texas\u2019 power grid. During a news conference Thursday, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick was asked by a reporter if the state is considering modifying the power grid, which\u00a0has encountered several issues over the years\u00a0due to severe weather. \u201cThe grid is a whole different issue which we\u2019re addressing, have been addressing, and will continue to address,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe power is down because the lines are down, and the transmission lines are down primarily because trees fell on them.\u201d Patrick addressed a report by a local media which mentioned burying the lines, which he said would be \u201cprohibitively expensive.\u201d Scorching summer shows no sign of stopping Texas is not alone as it suffers from a brutally hot summer. The US is experiencing a historically hot and deadly summer \u2013 and the hottest days are yet to come. This has so far been the hottest summer on record for around 100 US cities from Maine to California, and heat is suspected in the deaths of at least 37 people in July alone. That number is likely an underestimate, given the amount of time it takes to attribute a death to nature\u2019s\u00a0deadliest form of extreme weather. Many of the deaths have been in the West, where cities have shattered all-time record high temperatures during an unprecedented and long heat wave \u2013 exactly the kind of conditions scientists expect in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Heat is being investigated in the deaths of at least 19 people in Santa Clara County, California, alone, the county\u2019s medical examiner office told CNN. Everyone is vulnerable to heat, but\u00a0some are more at risk\u00a0than others. Children, the elderly, pregnant people, people with heart or blood pressure issues, outdoor workers or anyone without access to reliable cooling are more likely to succumb to heat-related illnesses than others. At least three of the people who may have succumbed to heat in Santa Clara County were unhoused without adequate access to cooling. Nine were over the age of 65, the county medical examiner told CNN. The extreme levels of heat in the West will begin to subside this weekend, ushering in a slow return to near \u2013 or slightly above normal \u2013 summer temperatures. Even without hitting record-high daily temperatures, the region gets quite hot in July. Heat will be a consistent companion for many Americans through the end of July, as hotter than average temperatures are likely through the end of the month and into at least early August, according to the Climate Prediction Center.

Farage becomes a member of Britain\u2019s parliament on his\u00a0eighth attempt after winning with 46.2% of the vote\u00a0in the heavily pro-Brexit Clacton, a seaside town on England\u2019s southeastern coast where Reform UK had polled well. With most of the votes now counted, results indicate Reform UK has won at least five seats in the House of Commons, a comparatively strong showing in Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system where smaller parties often struggle to translate their national support into parliamentary seats. Farage\u2019s Reform UK party attacked the Conservative Party on its failure to bring down rates of legal and illegal migration. That message appears to have won over a considerable number of socially conservative voters, with Reform UK candidates splitting the right-wing vote and contributing to the Conservatives\u2019 losses. Farage, an outspoken and polarizing figure, has long been known for using alarmist and confrontational language when discussing immigration. Since announcing his candidacy, Farage has warned supporters of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of asylum seekers, and last month he sparked outrage from political opponents after saying the West \u201cprovoked\u201d\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The veteran Euroskeptic, played a leading role in bringing about Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and has remained a divisive and disruptive figure in the country\u2019s politics since. Farage is perhaps best-known outside of the UK for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump, recently campaigning alongside him. But he has never been elected to parliament, losing seven elections since 1994 before this victory.\u00a0He won Clacton on a massive swing towards Reform UK, picking up 21,225 votes to the Conservatives\u2019 12,820. Friday\u2019s results now give Reform UK a small but significant base from which to oppose Labour leader and soon-to-be new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a crucial parliamentary platform. \u201cIt\u2019s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the center right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Farage said after winning the seat. He pledged to \u201cchallenge the general election properly in 2029,\u201d and promised to turn his rhetoric toward the Labour Party as it enters government. In many seats around the UK, Reform came second to Labour. Farage said the \u201cLabour government will be in trouble very, very quickly and we will now be targeting Labour votes. We\u2019re coming for Labour \u2013 be in no doubt about that.\u201d His presence during the election campaign upended the Conservative Party\u2019s efforts to win back socially conservative, pro-Brexit voters. His win comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge. Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. In snap French elections, far-right National Rally\u00a0won the first round last week. Speaking to CNN Thursday night, Politico deputy UK editor Rosa Prince said the result showed a \u201cvery widespread disaffection with the Conservative Party\u201d and that Reform UK\u2019s far-right policies \u201creally chime with some parts of the electorate.\u201d \u201cThe big question is going to be whether the Conservative Party tries to draw him in to them and maybe even join forces, or whether they push him away,\u201d Prince said. \u201cBecause what you could have is a total realignment of the right\u2026 I think Nigel Farage is certainly going to be causing trouble in the Houses of Parliament.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/nigel-farage-reform-party-win-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

The unnamed European, described by police as a 43-year-old man, visited the game reserve in South Africa\u2019s North West Province on Sunday, in a private vehicle, according to provincial police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone. He was accompanied by his fiancee and two other women, Mokgwabone said in a statement sent to CNN Wednesday. Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia identified the tourist as Carlos Luna, whom it said was from Zaragoza. The Pilanesberg Game Reserve is South Africa\u2019s fourth-largest park and a popular tourist destination. It is also home to more than\u00a07,000 animals, according to its website. Police said that while touring the park, the man and his passengers \u201cspotted three elephants with three calves,\u201d adding that \u201cthe man stopped the vehicle, alighted\u00a0and\u00a0went closer to take pictures\u201d before he was attacked and killed by the herd. The province\u2019s tourism board said in a statement that the Spaniard \u201cdid not heed the warnings\u201d of \u201chis fellow passengers, and occupants from two other vehicles that were at the sighting\u201d before approaching the elephants \u201cthat were feeding a distance from the road.\u201d \u201cAn adult elephant cow charged at the man, who then ran \u2026 (but) was unfortunately not able to escape or evade the elephant, which was now joined by the whole herd, and was caught and trampled to death,\u201d the board said. It added that the elephants left the scene afterward and did not attack anyone. \u201cStatements by witnesses who observed the\u00a0whole\u00a0incident further suggest that the female elephant that charged and attacked might have done so to protect the herd and young ones.\u201d Plans are being made to repatriate the tourist\u2019s body, the Spanish newspaper said, citing officials. Elephant attacks are not rare in South Africa. In 2019, a suspected poacher was attacked and killed by an elephant, and his body\u00a0eaten\u00a0by lions\u00a0in the northeastern Kruger National Park, authorities said at the time. In the same year, a security guard was similarly crushed to death by an elephant at a mine in the country\u2019s Limpopo province. Other parts of Southern Africa have witnessed similar tragedies. Three months ago, an elderly American woman was killed after an elephant charged at a vehicle transporting tourists inside Zambia\u2019s largest national park. The North West tourism board said it was \u201csaddened\u201d by the incident at the Pilanesberg park, urging tourists to \u201crespect distance between vehicles and animals and \u2026 to only alight in specially designated areas.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/africa/elephants-kill-spanish-tourist-south-africa-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_africa_dead-seals-cape-town-beaches-intl", "text": "Dead seals are washing up along beaches in South Africa\u2019s port city of Cape Town, a coastal management official told CNN Friday, amid an outbreak of rabies in the marine animals. \u201cWe believe this to be the first spread of rabies within a marine mammal population and that is concerning for us,\u201d said Cape Town\u2019s coastal manager Gregg Oelofse. Rabies in seals is rare and the only known case of the viral disease in a seal was\u00a0detected in the Svalbard islands of Norway\u00a0in 1980. Cape Town, home to\u00a0dozens of beaches\u00a0and a coastline extending over 300 kilometers (186 miles), harbors thousands of Cape fur\u00a0seals, a seal species\u00a0native to\u00a0southern Africa. The city has recorded \u201c11 positive rabies cases in seals so far,\u201d with the last positive case detected in a seal tested 10 days ago, according to Oelofse. He urged calm however, saying it is normal to find carcasses of Cape fur\u00a0seals\u00a0along the shoreline. While \u201clots\u201d of dead seals have washed ashore this week, many of them have died naturally, he said. He added that laboratory investigations were ongoing to determine how the seals were infected with the disease. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet where it started. They are genetically sequencing the rabies virus found. We will know when they are done with that,\u201d he said. The Western Cape provincial health department\u00a0alerted residents of a rabies risk\u00a0last month, warning of \u201cthe potential for rabies cases along the entire coastline where seals are present.\u201d Authorities said in late June that they had\u00a0confirmed seven cases of the disease\u00a0in seals from seven beaches in Cape Town and elsewhere on the Western Cape, urging residents to avoid contact with the animals. The first case was detected in October 2023, they noted. \u201cThere is no cause for panic,\u201d Cape Town city authorities stated at the time, adding that \u201cwhile rabies is new in Cape fur seals, it is endemic in many wildlife populations in South Africa.\u201d The area has witnessed many seal deaths in recent years. In November 2021, Western Cape provincial officials said they buried\u00a0close to 200 dead seals in a single day\u00a0after their carcasses washed ashore from suspected malnutrition. Rabies, which\u00a0is almost always fatal\u00a0once symptoms appear, is an infectious viral disease that affects the brain and central nervous system. According to the World Health Organization, dogs are the main source of\u00a0rabies transmission to humans. The virus is transmitted to humans through animal bites or scratches and can take between three and\u00a012 weeks\u00a0to begin showing symptoms. Oelofse said there was yet to be a seal-to-human transmission of rabies in Cape Town and the city\u2019s authorities were working to prevent it. \u201cWe have a lot of people\u00a0that are\u00a0coming into contact with seals daily such as surfers, kayakers, scuba divers, and others. So, one of the things that we want to avoid is the potential of transfer of rabies to a person and so far, that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/africa/dead-seals-cape-town-beaches-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

Beyond that, a 71-year-old woman died near Crystal Beach after her oxygen machine ran out of battery power and her generator shut down. Heat-related medical emergencies are also spiking in Houston, as 90-degree temperatures blanket southeast Texas, Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels under both heat and humidity \u2013 could reach 106 degrees in some areas, a life-threatening scenario for people without adequate cooling. The dangerous heat \u2013 driven by\u00a0human-caused climate change\u00a0\u2013 hasn\u2019t been limited to Texas. At least 28 heat-related deaths in the West have been reported since July 1, as a record-breaking heat wave beats down on states including California, Oregon and Arizona. Essential operations, including hospitals and senior living homes, have been prioritizing powering medically necessary equipment. Some Houston hospitals are at risk of overcrowding as they cannot release patients to homes without power, prompting city officials to organize overflow beds in an indoor sports stadium, Patrick, the lieutenant governor, said Tuesday. Nine fire stations in Houston have closed and relocated because they did not have generators, Pe\u00f1a said, even as emergency calls flood in. Animal rescue teams and pet owners have also been working overtime to protect fuzzy companions. Pug Hearts Houston owner Cindy Rothermel said she heard of pug owners sitting in their cars with the A/C running to cool the dogs down in \u201cintolerable\u201d heat. Texans losing patience with utility company More than 1 million CenterPoint customers remain without power as of Thursday afternoon. Beryl\u2019s impact left more than 2.2 million customers without electricity on Monday. By Wednesday night, CenterPoint said it had restored power to 1.1 million customers and hoped to have an additional 400,000 restored by Friday and 350,000 more by Sunday. But roughly 500,000 customers in the Houston area will not have electrical power restored until sometime next week, according to a CenterPoint Energy executive who spoke Thursday before the Texas Public Utility Commission. The homes and businesses most affected by the power outage are in the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Beryl on the southern side of Houston and up through the Interstate 45 corridor, said Jason Ryan, CenterPoint\u2019s executive vice president for regulatory services and government affairs. The private utility says these neighborhoods suffered massive electrical infrastructure damage, with fallen trees and branches dismantling powerlines that now need to be replaced by crews on the ground. \u201cWe know we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cI know customers are frustrated.\u201d As the miserable conditions persist, anger is spreading among those who say the utility should have been more prepared for the storm. \u201cAlmost universally people have lost patience with CenterPoint,\u201d Ramirez, the councilman, told CNN. \u201cCenterPoint can\u2019t seem to tell us how long this is going to last.\u201d Just north of Houston in Spring, Texas, Elizabeth Garrison, 65, and her husband, 77, are enduring nearly 90 degree temperatures in the house without air conditioning, she told CNN. Now on their fourth day without power, the pair are making do with just two fans, one battery-powered and the other hooked up to a neighbor\u2019s generator. \u201cYou get very very warm, you open the windows and you just try to drink a lot of liquids,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cIt was okay because we heard on Wednesday that a lot of people were going to get their power. So it\u2019s like OK, I can make it Tuesday. But then Wednesday evening comes and you don\u2019t have power and it\u2019s even worse.\u201d In Fort Bend County, southwest of the Houston area, Sheriff Eric Fagan said authorities received a call \u201cthat a CenterPoint Energy worker had a\u00a0gun\u00a0pulled on them.\u201d \u201cWe all need to be calm and patient,\u201d the sheriff said in a\u00a0news conference\u00a0Thursday. \u201cEveryone is working hard out there 24/7\u2026 You have to realize CenterPoint called people outside of the state to help with this emergency.\u201d The sheriff warned, \u201cWe will not tolerate them being abused, let alone having a\u00a0gun\u00a0pulled on them.\u201d Several members of the Texas Public Utility Commission have urged company officials to improve communication as part of \u201crebuilding trust\u201d with customers in the hurricane-damaged areas. \u201cInfrastructure is going to break,\u201d said Thomas Gleeson, chairman of the state commission. \u201cThings are going to happen. But if people feel like they\u2019re being effectively communicated with, it makes it a lot easier to go through.\u201d Just after July 4, about three days before the storm hit the Texas coast, Ryan, the CenterPoint executive, said the utility put out its first request for 3,000 \u201cmutual assistance\u201d workers to pre-position ahead of the storm. As the path of the storm moved east and closer to the Houston area in the final days before landfall, CenterPoint says it increased the request for repair crews to 10,000. The utility said Thursday morning it would begin providing estimated restoration times on its status tracker. CenterPoint Vice President of Operations Darin Carroll told CNN affiliate KHOU the pace of repairs will begin to slow as the community moves deeper into disaster recovery. Additionally, Carroll told the station the utility aimed to improve the accuracy of its power outage map, which has been criticized by residents across social media for having inaccuracies, including saying power is restored where it is not. The city council grilled a CenterPoint executive on Wednesday, asking why the company hasn\u2019t done more to prepare for storms. Brad Tutunjian, CenterPoint vice president of electric distribution and power delivery, said they\u2019ve never seen an incident to this magnitude and described it as the \u201clargest outage in our history.\u201d Three months before Hurricane Beryl hit Texas, CenterPoint Energy estimated it would need $2 billion to harden its system against worsening extreme weather. The company reported it needed to restore power after 15 extreme weather events between 2019 to 2023. The longest restoration time to date was after the deadly winter storm and brutal cold snap in February 2021, when it took 116 hours and 40 minutes to restore power to more than 8 million impacted customers. Much of Texas\u2019s electrical infrastructure was built in the 1970s and 1980s, when weather was less extreme, Joshua Rhodes, an energy research scientist at UT Austin, told CNN. The string of storms Texas has been hit with in recent years is now taking a toll. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise the infrastructure built for milder weather is failing more often,\u201d Rhodes said. Elder care facilities struggle without power Senior care facilities and residents who rely on electric medical devices are particularly at risk as power outages stretch through at least the end of the week. CrowdSource Rescue, a nonprofit primarily serving as a search-and-rescue group, identified roughly 120 living facilities for seniors that need help. The group has helped deliver generators and supplies to 16 so far. \u201cThe whole city is hurting and suffering. That\u2019s what it feels like right now, from my vantage point,\u201d said Matthew Marchetti, a co-founder of CrowdSource Rescue. \u201cBut I think for the seniors, they\u2019re taking the brunt of it. So we\u2019re trying to do everything we can.\u201d Marchetti said his teams typically set up an AC unit and generator in one part of a facility \u2013 like a community room or a leasing office \u2013 for people to gather and cool off, but the challenge has been moving people down to those rooms from high floors in buildings with no working elevators. After two days of flood-related issues, mold, no power and excruciating heat, 57-year-old Frankie Thibideaux said she left her Houston-area residential building to stay in a hotel. But she remains worried about the mostly elderly residents who occupy the building in Missouri City, just southwest of Houston, Thibideaux told CNN. Many of them live on the third and fourth floor, she said, but several have no way of getting down because they rely on walkers or wheelchairs. \u201cPeople up there are on dialysis,\u201d Thibideaux said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. They\u2019re trying to keep their medicine cold, but there\u2019s no ice anywhere.\u201d Storm brought tornadoes, flooding to Northeast The National Weather Service in Buffalo, New York, confirmed two tornadoes in the area Wednesday, as the remnants of Beryl tracked across the state. The local weather service issued nine tornado warnings Wednesday \u2013-\u00a0the most ever put out\u00a0in\u00a0a single day. Flash flood warnings were in effect Thursday morning from\u00a0northern\u00a0New\u00a0York\u00a0to central Maine, with early morning flash flooding \u00ad\u00adin Vermont and New Hampshire. As the system continues to move east-northeast, the bulk of the storm\u2019s impacts are expected to be over for most of New England. Over 100 people have been rescued and a body was recovered from floodwaters after Beryl\u2019s remnants swept through Vermont Wednesday, according to state officials. The fatality has not officially been tied to the storm, but officials believe a man was in a vehicle that was swept away in water, according to Public Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/weather/texas-heat-beryl-power-outage-thursday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_middleeast_gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam", "text": "The recent deaths of more Palestinian children due to hunger and malnutrition in the Gaza Strip indicates\u00a0that famine\u00a0has spread across the entire enclave, according to a United Nations statement, citing independent experts. An estimated 495,000 people in Gaza \u2013 or 22% of the population \u2013 are \u201cexperiencing an extreme lack of food,\u201d according to an Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report last month. Under the IPC system \u2013\u00a0a five-phase scale used as a common standard for classifying the severity of food insecurity \u2013 a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met. In the UN statement, published Tuesday, the group of experts said: \u201cIsrael\u2019s intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza. \u201cWe call upon the international community to prioritise the delivery of humanitarian aid by land by any means necessary, end Israel\u2019s siege, and establish a ceasefire,\u201d they continued. The experts said that deaths of children from a lack of food and water indicate that health and social structures have been critically weakened. \u201cWhen the first child dies from malnutrition and dehydration, it becomes irrefutable that\u00a0famine\u00a0has taken hold,\u201d the experts added. The statement cited the deaths of three Palestinian children \u2014 6-month-old Fayez Ataya, 13-year-old Abdulqader Al-Serhi\u00a0and 9-year-old Ahmad Abu Reida. It said they died from malnutrition and lack of access to adequate healthcare in late May and early June. The experts emphasized that these children had died from starvation\u00a0despite medical treatment in central Gaza, indicating\u00a0that\u00a0famine\u00a0has now spread from northern Gaza into central and southern regions. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) for comment. Israel\u2019s permanent mission to the UN in Geneva dismissed the statement, alleging the experts were \u201cspreading misinformation\u201d and \u201csupporting Hamas propaganda.\u201d In June, the IPC reported a deterioration in the humanitarian situation following the launch of Israel\u2019s military operations in Rafah. The Rafah crossing \u2013 a crucial route for humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2013 has been closed since early May. Meanwhile, a much-lauded but ultimately troubled US military pier set up off the Gazan coast will be permanently removed soon, according to US officials. The $230 temporary pier operation \u2013 intended as an alternative aid distribution option to land routes \u2013 based at the Israeli port of Ashdod has faced many challenges since it began operation in mid-May. Last month it was disconnected from Gaza due to inclement weather, but will be reconnected one final time to deliver any remaining aid from Cyprus and from a floating dock that is moored several miles off shore. More than 19.4 million pounds of aid have been delivered via the pier to the collection area in Gaza since it started operations. Humanitarian aid workers continue to face tremendous risks while trying to distribute desperately needed aid to Gaza, the UN said. The majority of the infrastructure supporting humanitarian work in Gaza has been destroyed in Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas, according to the same report. ActionAid, an international campaign group, described the UN experts\u2019 statement as a \u201cstark warning.\u201d \u201cThis is a stain on humanity\u2019s conscience\u00a0and an entirely preventable, human-made crisis. The world cannot sit back and watch any more children die from lack of food: more life-saving aid must be allowed into Gaza immediately,\u201d the group said in a Wednesday statement. \u201cWe call on all states to use every diplomatic lever available to them to bring about a permanent ceasefire, now.\u201d Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has depleted the territory\u2019s health system, leaving staff unable to treat malnourished children. Doctors previously told CNN they are being forced to turn away parents begging for baby milk, unable to even triage young patients with chronic illnesses compounded by severe hunger. And as Israel continues its siege\u00a0on Gaza,\u00a0preventing aid groups getting enough food into the enclave, parents say they have no choice but to watch their children starve to death. At least 34 children have already died of malnutrition in Gaza, the government media office reported on June 22. The true number could be higher, as limited access to the strip has impeded aid agencies\u2019 efforts to fully assess the crisis there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

Israeli forces targeted the gate of a school housing displaced people in the town of Abasan, east of Khan Younis, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, which called the attack \u201ca heinous massacre against displaced citizens.\u201d The strike injured another 53 people, the ministry added, including some who are in a \u201cserious and critical\u201d condition. The death toll is expected to increase, as casualties are still being transferred to the nearby Nasser Hospital. The Israeli military said it conducted a strike \u201cnear\u201d Al-Awda school on Tuesday, and that it had targeted \u201ca terrorist\u201d who participated in the October 7 attacks into southern Israel. \u201cEarlier this evening, using precise munition, the IAF struck a terrorist from Hamas\u2019 military wing\u00a0who took part, among other terrorist activities, in the October 7 brutal massacre carried out by the Hamas terrorist organization in southern Israel,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. \u201cThe IDF is looking into the reports that civilians were harmed, adjacent to the Al-Awda School\u00a0in the south of Khan Younis, which is located near the location of the strike. The incident is\u00a0under\u00a0review,\u201d the IDF added. CNN cannot verify the IDF\u2019s statements. Hamas also condemned it in a statement, saying the strike on the school represents \u201ca continuation of the genocidal war and horrific massacres against our defenseless people.\u201d Hamas called for people around the world to \u201cimmediately take to the streets and squares in massive demonstrations and rallies\u201d in support of people in Gaza, as well as called for people in the West Bank to support Gaza and clash with Israeli forces. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed 38,295 Palestinians and injured another 88,241 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. \u2018Why don\u2019t we have the right to live?\u2019 CNN footage from the aftermath of the attack shows bewildered Palestinian children clambering over slabs of broken concrete, with old clothes strewn across blown-out buildings. One survivor told CNN she and other Palestinians were tucked into a local marketplace when \u201ca missile landed on us.\u201d \u201cWe are dying here\u2026 We saw the scene of 30 martyrs piled on top of each other,\u201d said Umm Mahmoud. \u201cOur hearts break with sadness\u2026 They (Israeli forces) want to terrorize us.\u201d Elsewhere, in Nasser Hospital, relatives of the deceased could be seen wailing in horror, their cheeks red and flushed, in CNN video. One woman, whose nephews Ahmad and Omar were killed in the attack, said she had been displaced for nine months. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have the right to live? Why do our young people die like this?\u201d the aunt told CNN. \u201cWe have been here homeless for nine months and no one cares about us\u2026 We want to live in peace.\u201d Another Palestinian, Jadallah Abu Jamee, said her nine-year-old granddaughter, Rimas Abu Jamee, and cousin were killed in the strike. She told CNN that her daughter, a university student, was in surgery for an amputated hand and a head injury. \u201cA nine-year-old girl, what did she do to deserve this?\u201d said Jamee. The Government Media Office in Gaza condemned the attack, calling it a \u201cmassacre against civilians\u201d by Israel. The government statement also called on the international community, the United Nations, and international NGOs to put pressure on Israel and the United States to stop the war in Gaza. The commissioner-general of the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNWRA), Philippe Lazzarini, condemned the attack, warning \u201cthe blatant disregard of international humanitarian law cannot become the new normal.\u201d \u201cSchools have gone from safe places of education and hope for children to overcrowded shelters and often ending up a place of death and misery,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cNine months in, under our watch, the relentless, endless killings, destruction and despair continue. Gaza is no place for children.\u201d This comes days after an\u00a0Israeli\u00a0attack killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured dozens more at a school run by the United Nations\u2019 agency for Palestinian refugees in central Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Saturday. UNRWA\u2019s Al-Jaouni school was sheltering displaced people in al-Nuseirat camp, according to the ministry. The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that militants were operating in structures in the school area. CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military\u2019s claim. On July 1, the IDF issued instructions for hundreds of thousands of people in Khan Younis in the south, Shujaya in central Gaza and\u00a0the several neighborhoods of Gaza City to leave. The effect has been to increase the total number of displaced people in Gaza, from 1.7 million in May to an estimated 1.9 million now, according to the UN. Approximately nine out of 10 people in Gaza are now estimated to be internally displaced, many of them multiple times. The IDF has said that evacuation orders are necessary so that civilians don\u2019t get caught up in its renewed operations in areas where Hamas is seeking to re-establish a presence. The IDF insists it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Human rights bodies have repeatedly criticized Israeli relocation orders. In May, the Norwegian Refugee Council warned the absence of safety assurances and proper accommodation for displaced Palestinians is a form of \u201cforcible transfer, amounting to a serious violation of international law.\u201d Hamas has said the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d Humanitarian agencies say the evacuation orders have had a major impact on the few operational hospitals in Gaza. Besides the obvious dangers in moving from one part of Gaza to another, the constant displacements make it harder for aid agencies to target the provision of food.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_mona-gallery-australia-women-only-exhibit-hnk-intl", "text": "A museum in Australia is being forced to allow men into art exhibit originally conceived for women only, after a tribunal ruled it \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d following a complaint by a disgruntled man who was denied entry. Tasmania\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art\u00a0(MONA)\u00a0has been ordered to stop refusing entry to \u201cpersons who do not identify as ladies,\u201d to its Ladies Lounge exhibit within 28 days, after a ruling was made by the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal on Tuesday. The experiential artwork by artist and museum curator\u00a0Kirsha Kaechele\u00a0is billed by the museum as a \u201ctremendously lavish space\u201d where women can indulge in \u201cdecadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures \u2014 hosted and entertained by the fabulous butler.\u201d Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales,\u00a0who had paid the museum\u2019s $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, was barred from entering the exhibit\u00a0on\u00a0April 1 last year. According to tribunal documents, Lau believed he experienced direct gender discrimination. \u201cHe felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,\u201d read the notes. During proceedings, Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room is indeed part of the art \u2014 giving\u00a0them\u00a0a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. Kaechele said she believed that women\u00a0\u201cdeserve both equal rights and special privileges in the form of unequal rights,\u201d as a means of restitution for historical injustices, \u201cfor a minimum of 300 years.\u201d In its judgment, the tribunal recognized that the art exhibition had \u201ca pointedly participatory component that is intentionally discriminatory, for a good faith artistic purpose that many might not only appreciate but sympathise with or endorse.\u201d However, it also asserted that Australia\u2019s 1998 anti-discrimination act \u201cdoes not permit discrimination for good faith artistic purpose per se.\u201d An extension of the art Throughout the proceedings Kaechele and her supporters treated the tribunal as an extension of her art, wearing matching dark blue suits and synchronizing their movements. In her witness statement to the tribunal, the artist said: \u201cWe are so deeply embedded in the dominion of man that we do not even see the myriad ways in which we adhere to and multiply his reign.\u201d She added this is why the Ladies Lounge was needed as \u201ca peaceful space women can retreat to; a haven in which to think clearly, and relish the pure company of women \u2014 to escape the invisible story woven through history.\u201d Kaechele in an earlier interview with ABC\u2019s The Project, told the program she was \u201cgrateful\u201d for Lau\u2019s complaint, as it gave her the chance to test out the argument legally, but warned that a ruling in Lau\u2019s favor would mean the Ladies Lounge would have to close. \u201cBecause the requirement is that it will have to open to men, and that\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said. After Tuesday\u2019s ruling, MONA\u2019s official spokesperson told CNN that the institution was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the tribunal\u2019s decision. \u201cWe will take some time to absorb the result and consider our options,\u201d they said, adding: \u201cWe request that the artist\u2019s privacy is respected at this time.\u201d The museum\u2019s official Instagram\u00a0account posted a more explicit response: a photo of a velvet-clad hand, adorned with the initials KK, giving the middle finger, to which one user commented, \u201cI visited in 2021 with my husband and loved the novelty of being able to go into a space that no man was allowed into.

{"id": "2024_07_12_style_dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon", "text": "Pristine, crisp and all-white \u2014 tennis whites have been a tradition dating back centuries. The distinctive look has not only made the racquet sport stand out, it has also become a sartorial mainstay off the courts, too. And even though most of the major tournaments have done away with the hueless uniformity, Wimbledon, the very first of them, has remained strict in its policy (as have many private clubs around the world). The prestigious championship even clamped down on the rule a decade ago, prohibiting colorful accents that had become increasingly common \u2014\u00a0 the year after Roger Federer\u2019s now-infamous pair of orange-soled sneakers were banned after his first round in 2013. The rules once called for \u201cpredominantly white\u201d outfits, allowing some competitors to play with color combinations, such as Serena Williams\u2019 tribute to Wimbledon treat strawberries and cream in 2010. But the crackdown changed the wording to \u201calmost entirely white,\u201d per the organizers: no off-white, no panels of color, no varying colorways on sneakers. The only recent loosening of rules was in 2023, to allow women to wear dark-colored shorts on the court following criticisms that the rules weren\u2019t accommodating for menstruation leaks. But why did tennis whites become the standard? The reasons often cited are practical ones, from heat reflection to sweat-masking. But senior curator Kevin Jones of the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (FIDM) museum in Los Angeles, who organized the recent traveling exhibition \u201cSporting Fashion: Outdoor Girls 1800 - 1960,\u201d said it really comes down to a long history of clubs enforcing social status, starting when lawn tennis skyrocketed in popularity in Victorian-era England as a leisure sport \u2014 and a rare one that allowed women, too. \u201cIt\u2019s completely elitist because white clothes are difficult to maintain,\u201d he said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cAnd the types of materials that these dresses were made of, which were cottons and linens, creased easily, so to keep them nice and freshly starched was also an aspect of that care.\u201d Challenging the rules Of course, tennis style has drastically changed in a century-and-a-half since it first became a recreational sensation for the upper class, hot off the heels of croquet (and utilizing the same neatly trimmed lawns). Early tennis attire was more akin to 19th-century leisurewear: women wore striped and patterned garments with long skirts, corseting and wide-brimmed hats; men donned wool pants, button-downs or sweaters. Because spectators and players have often adhered to similar styles, fashion and tennis have had a \u201cmutual exchange over time, where various tennis trends have seeped into wider culture as well,\u201d said sports journalist Ben Rothenberg, author of \u201cTennis: The Stylish Life\u201d as well as a recent biography on Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s been more than apparent in the past few months as Zendaya turned out a series of tennis-inspired high-fashion red-carpet looks matching the on- and off-court drama of the film \u201cChallengers,\u201d and recently faced Federer in an \u201cair tennis\u201d match for a campaign by the sportswear brand On. The close alignment with fashion has also led to the success of classic tennis-born labels such as Lacoste and Fred Perry, as well as radical new fashion innovations introduced on the court, like Elsa Schiaparelli dressing Spanish player Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez in culottes, a split skirt, for Wimbledon in 1931, to onlookers\u2019 shock. Like with De \u00c1lvarez, dress codes in tennis have often changed after an initial scandal. The French player Suzanne Lenglen was one of the earliest and most memorable cases, when she did away with layered, long dresses and wore a more airy calf-length skirt and shorter sleeves at Wimbledon in 1919. A muse to the designer Jean Patou, Lenglen became tennis\u2019 first fashion icon with her signature headscarf and then-provocative shorter hems. At the US, French and Australian Open, players have challenged definitions of what tennis clothes can be thanks to looser rules (subject to referee opinion). None have done so more than the Williams sisters, with Serena wearing a denim mini, tutus and cape-like silhouettes and Venus\u2019s lacy black-and-red ensemble that drew comparisons to lingerie. More recently, Serena Williams\u2019 Nike kit became the topic of conversation at the 2018 French Open when she opted for a black compression catsuit that didn\u2019t feature the compulsory tennis skirt. Though she cited its circulation benefits following a severe blood-clot scare with the birth of her child, the French Open said it would bar the style in the future. However, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association formally allowed it, and Williams continued to wear versions of the bodysuit at the 2019 and 2021 Australian Opens, normalizing the agile and simplified cut for the tennis court. \u201cI love wearing skirts,\u201d she told CNN in April while reflecting on the controversy. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure that my blood was always circulating and I had been in a near-death experience.\u201d \u201cSo I think there should have been\u2026 understanding around that whole outfit,\u201d she added. Brand distinctions Most of the Grand Slam tournaments dropped the all-white rules decades ago, likely in a bid to attract more television viewers and advertisers in an age of increased visibility for the sport. \u201cColor is vital to draw the eye and especially for those sports companies to be able to advertise their logos and their colors,\u201d James explained. Sports and luxury brands advertise through fashion in multiple ways, from dressing star players in custom statement pieces to promoting merchandised designs on competitors. Wimbledon\u2019s restrictive rules have been \u201cfrustrating\u201d for brands trying to sell their tournament collections, Rothenberg said. When Fila introduced Bjorn Borg throwback shirts in 2001, replicating what the tennis star wore during his five-time-winning Wimbledon streak from 1976 to 1980, Wimbledon officials said they no longer adhered to the rules. The decision sent the sports brand \u201cscrambling\u201d to get new shirts to the players wearing them, Rothenberg explained. And, after Federer\u2019s orange-soled shoes were banned, Nike had to act fast to spin their brief appearance, advertising them as \u201cOne Match Wonders\u201d in a print ad. For players, the smallest infractions have proved controversial, and some players have outright refused to play along, as Andre Agassi did from 1988-90 when he boycotted Wimbledon entirely. In 2017, Jurij Rodionov was told to change blue underwear that was peeking out of his shirts, while Sabine Lisicki recently said that she and women were often required to switch out their skin-colored bras. But Rothenberg doesn\u2019t see more leniency happening anytime soon from Wimbledon\u2019s decision-makers. \u201cI think Wimbledon sees its anachronisms as a big part of its brand and its value,\u201d he explained. \u201cWimbledon has clung on to it as a way to be distinct and different \u2014 and I think it\u2019s largely been successful. It doesn\u2019t look like any other tournament.\u201d There have been criticisms levied against the major tournaments whenever women players seem to be disproportionately affected by their dress codes, and though Rothenberg agrees, he also points out that women\u2019s styles have been more creative. Men\u2019s tenniswear has deviated less from shorts and lightwear polos or shortsleeve athletic shirts since they were introduced. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of men\u2019s short length getting markedly shorter over the last 12 months though, especially players who really have hiked up their shorts a lot,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe someday there will be rules against that if they start showing too much cheek.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

At least 27 people have been killed and 53 have been injured in the strike, which hit the gate of the Al-Mutanabbi school complex, also known locally as the Al-Awda Schools, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. In a video filmed at the scene by a journalist working for CNN in the aftermath of the strike, a remnant of a US-made GBU-39 small-diameter bomb (SDB) is clearly visible. The remnant is the tail section of the munition, according to three explosive weapons experts who reviewed the video for CNN. \u201cBased on the characteristic shape of the fin, the screw housings, as well as the overall shape of the munition fragment\u2026 this remnant is consistent with a GBU-39-series tail actuation system located in the rear of the munition,\u201d Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), told CNN. Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, also told CNN the remnants were of a tail actuation section of an SDB/GBU-39. \u201cPart of the section is missing, showing a cutaway of the internals,\u201d Ball tweeted. Israel said it was targeting a Hamas operative in the strike. In a statement Tuesday, the Israeli military said: \u201cEarlier this evening, using precise munition, the [Israeli air force] struck a terrorist from Hamas\u2019 military wing who took part, among other terrorist activities, in the October 7 brutal massacre.\u201d CNN has asked the IDF about the use of US-made munitions used in the Khan Younis strike. CNN identified remnants of GBU-39 small-diameter bombs in another two Israeli strikes in the past few months. The GBU-39, which is manufactured by Boeing, is a high-precision munition \u201cdesigned to attack strategically important point targets\u201d and result in low collateral damage, explosive weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith told CNN following the first strike on Rafah tent camp, which took place on May 26. \u201cUsing any munition, even of this size, will always incur risks in a densely populated area,\u201d said Cobb-Smith, who is also a former British Army artillery officer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/middleeast/israel-us-munitions-school-strike-khan-younis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_australia_russian-born-couple-charged-australia-intl-hnk", "text": "Australia has charged two Russian-born Australian citizens with preparing for an espionage offense after allegedly obtaining military information that they planned to hand to Russian authorities. The married couple had been in Australia for more than 10 years and were arrested Thursday at their home in Everton Park, a northern suburb of Brisbane, according to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The Russian-born woman, 40, was an army private working as an information systems technician with the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for several years, the agencies said in a joint news conference on Friday. She became an Australian citizen in 2016, and her Russian-born husband, 62, a self-employed laborer, obtained Australian citizenship in 2020, they added. \u201cThe AFP will allege the individuals worked together to access Australian Defence Force material that related to Australia\u2019s national security interests,\u201d said AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw. \u201cNo significant compromise,\u201d had been identified and no other individuals appeared to be involved, Kershaw added, though he said the investigation was in its early stages. The couple appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday and were remanded in custody to next appear in court on September 20. Australian Federal Police will allege the woman went to Russia without notifying Australian authorities while she was on long-term leave from the ADF last year. \u201cWe allege that while she was in Russia, she instructed her husband, who remained in Australia, on how to log into her official work account from their Brisbane home,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cWe allege her husband would access requested material and would send [it] to his wife in Russia. We allege they sought that information with the intention of providing it to Russian authorities.\u201d Kershaw said a key focus of the investigation is whether that information was handed over to Russian authorities. If it was, the charge could be upgraded to espionage. The investigation will include how the woman obtained security clearance to access sensitive ADF material, and how she was able to bypass systems to apparently travel undetected to Russia. \u201cThere was some misleading on her behalf of where she was allegedly at and what country,\u201d Kershaw said. It\u2019s the first time an espionage offense has been used since new laws were introduced in 2018. The charge of preparing for an espionage offense carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.\u00a0An upgraded charge carries a maximum term of 25 years in prison to life. ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess said the arrests demonstrated the strength of Australia\u2019s national security culture, not its deficiency. \u201cThe espionage threat is real. Multiple countries are seeking to steal Australia\u2019s secrets. We cannot be naive and we cannot be complacent,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/australia/russian-born-couple-charged-australia-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
