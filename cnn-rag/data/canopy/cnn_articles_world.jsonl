Authorities identified the suspect only by his last name, Cui, who was describes as a 55-year-old man from the city\u2019s Longtan District. Police said he \u201ccollided with a foreigner while walking\u201d in Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in the city center. The suspect then stabbed the instructors, as well as a Chinese tourist who stepped forward and tried to stop him during the incident, police said in a statement. Police said they received the call around 11:49 a.m. local time Monday, after which they dispatched officers to the scene and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. The injured \u201chave all received proper medical treatment and are not in danger \u2026\u201d police said earlier. The educators from Cornell College, a private liberal arts college\u00a0in Mount Vernon, Iowa, were wounded \u201cin a serious incident\u201d\u00a0on Monday, while participating in a partnership program with Beihua University in Jilin, according to the college. \u201cWe have been in contact with all four instructors and are assisting them during this time,\u201d Cornell College President Jonathan Brand said in a statement, adding no students took part in the program. Footage purportedly showing the aftermath of the daylight attack emerged on Chinese social media on Monday but was swiftly censored. It showed two men and a woman lying on the ground covered in large blood stains, surrounded by onlookers. They appeared conscious and were talking on their cell phones, the video showed. CNN geolocated the video to Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in Jilin city center, less than half an hour\u2019s drive from Beihua University. Monday was a public holiday in China. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that \u201cfour foreign teachers at Beihua University were attacked\u201d while visiting the park Monday morning \u2013 adding they were immediately taken to the hospital and did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner told CNN his brother, David Zabner, was one of the victims of the stabbing. Zabner said his brother, who was on his second visit to China with Cornell, is \u201cdoing well\u201d and has \u201cbeen stitched up and seems to be recovering,\u201d after speaking to him on Tuesday morning Beijing time. The other three victims survived the attack, Adam Zabner said, adding he could not comment on their health status. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely grateful that my brother is OK and that he survived this attack,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe hope of my family is to get my brother back home as soon as possible and get them healthy. And we really just want to thank the US State Department for all their help, and also our federal delegation from Iowa who have been particularly helpful.\u201d The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing incident in China and is monitoring the situation. \u2018Horrifying attack\u2019 Knife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled. The country has faced a spate of stabbing rampages in public places including schools and hospitals. But public attacks against foreigners are rare. The attack in Jilin comes as China has been seeking to draw back international visitors following three years of stringent Covid-19 border controls. It also comes amid efforts to boost educational exchanges with the United States as the two countries look to stabilize their fraught relationship. The incident has drawn attention and concern in Iowa from officials and lawmakers. Gov. Kim Reynolds called it a \u201chorrifying attack.\u201d US Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents the district where Cornell College is located, said the college employees \u201cwere brutally stabbed\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in our power to bring these Iowans home safely.\u201d On China\u2019s heavily censored social media, visuals and discussions about the attack had been swiftly erased since Monday. Censorship appeared to have relaxed somewhat by noon Tuesday to allow some comments to surface. Some Chinese internet users called it a \u201cterrible\u201d incident, while others questioned why Chinese media was not reporting on the attack. Some also expressed concerns about its potential impact on China\u2019s global image and the willingness of foreigners to visit the country, amid a rise in nationalism and anti-American sentiment. At its news conference Tuesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry sought to dismiss concerns that the attack would affect educational exchanges between China and the US. \u201cCarrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States is in the common interests of both sides and has received active support and response from various sectors in both countries,\u201d said Lin, the spokesperson. \u201cChina is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China has always taken effective measures and will continue to take relevant measures to effectively protect the safety of all foreigners in China.\u201d Study ties Cornell College began a partnership with Beihua University in 2018, which would see the Chinese institution provide funding for educators from the Iowa school to travel and live in China and teach a portion of a course in areas of computer science, math and physics over two-week periods, according to information posted on the college website at the time. China has been trying to boost its educational cooperation with the US, which has suffered considerable setbacks due to the Covid pandemic and bilateral tensions. During a visit to the US in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the country would invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years to foster personal ties between the two countries. The Chinese leader noted his own enduring ties to the state of Iowa in his announcement. Xi stayed with a host family in Iowa during his first visit to the US nearly four decades ago, an experience he has described as \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Last week, Xi encouraged universities in China and the US to \u201cstrengthen exchanges and cooperation,\u201d in a letter to the president of Kean University in New Jersey, which has a China-based joint venture with Wenzhou University, according to state media. China has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world, partly due to its strict gun controls and powerful mass surveillance. But it has continued to face mass stabbings in public places. In May, two people were killed and another 21 injured in a knife attack in a hospital in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning\u00a0stabbing incident\u00a0outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province. And a\u00a02022 stabbing, also at a kindergarten, killed three and injured six in eastern Jiangxi province. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported the wrong day for the stabbings.

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England. In 1995, it was stolen from Longleat, the home of Thynne\u2019s descendants, and disappeared for seven years, before it was found at a bus stop in London by art detective Charles Hill. \u201cThis is a painting, then, that has been coveted by aristocrats, archdukes and emperors alike: prized for its vividly coloured scene of familial affection within the natural world,\u201d Christie\u2019s said in the statement. \u201cLike its subjects,\u00a0The Rest on the Flight into Egypt\u00a0has been on a long and eventful journey \u2014 a journey that\u2019s far from over.\u201d The painting will be offered as part of the Old Masters Part I auction at Christie\u2019s in London on July 2.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/style/titian-painting-auction-scli-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

The claim filed by the English Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA) and the Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionnels \u2013 the French player union \u2013 and supported by FIFPRO Europe, accuses FIFA of violating player\u2019s rights and potentially EU competition law by creating a calendar that is \u201coverloaded and unworkable.\u201d According to FIFPRO Europe, FIFA has \u201cfailed to meaningfully engage or negotiate and have unilaterally continued a programme of competition expansion despite the opposition of player unions.\u201d \u201cSince all attempts at dialogue have failed, it is now up to us to ensure that the fundamental rights of players are fully respected by taking the matter to the European courts and thus to the European Court of Justice (ECJ),\u201d said FIFPRO President David Terrier. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of stigmatising a particular competition, but of denouncing both the underlying problem and the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d Terrier added. CNN has reached out to FIFA for comment on the legal action. Next year\u2019s Club World Cup is scheduled to take place in the United States from mid-June to mid-July, and the unions say it infringes on the players\u2019 right to an annual break, breaching the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFREU) \u201cwithout any serious justification.\u201d The player unions are asking the Brussels Court of Commerce to refer the case to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling over concerns about forced labour, rights to healthy working conditions, rights to collective bargaining and restriction of competition. \u201cThere are too many emerging instances across football where the rights of players, and the legal implications of decisions by governing bodies and competition organizers, are seen as something that can just be ignored,\u201d PFA President\u00a0Maheta Molango said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Thursday. \u201cToo many within football act like it is exempt from the normal requirements of employers and employees. \u201cPlayers are not being listened to and they want to see action. As their union, we have a duty to intervene and to enforce their legal rights as employees. Ultimately, that time has now come,\u201d Molango added. In May, FIFPRO and the World League Associations (WLA) sent a letter to FIFA threatening legal action over the global football calendar which they said is \u201cnow beyond saturation, to the point that national leagues are unable to properly organise their competitions\u201d while \u201cplayers are being pushed beyond their limits, with significant injury risks and impacts on their welfare\u201d. At the time, FIFA denied claims that it had failed to engage stakeholders about the football calendar and said this was discussed with both FIFPRO and WLA on several occasions as a fundamental part of the wider topic of the Future of Football in 2021 and 2022. FIFA President Gianni Infantino used his opening address to the 74th FIFA Congress in Bangkok on May 17, to defend the football calendar. \u201cFIFA is financing football all over the world,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cThe revenues that we generate are not just going to a few clubs in one country, the revenues that we generate are going to 211 countries all over the world. There is no other organization that does that,\u201d he added. In addition to the larger Club World Cup, all three European club competitions will be expanded to 36 teams for the 2024/2025 season. The group stage has been consolidated into a single 36-team league, with clubs in the Champions League and Europa League playing eight games in this phase instead of the current six. Clubs in the Conference League will still play six matches. In all three of those European competitions, teams placed 1st-8th under the new format qualify automatically for the knockout round. Clubs that finish 9th-24th will then play a further two matches in a playoff stage to determine who advances to the round of 16. According to recent research conducted by FIFPRO and Football Benchmark, 23 year-old Real Madrid and Brazil superstar Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior has already played more than double the amount of matches that his compatriot and former Ballon d\u2019Or winner Ronaldinho played before turning 24. Ahead of the Champions League final on June 1, Vin\u00edcius Jr.\u2019s Madrid teammate Jude Bellingham had played\u00a018,486 minutes\u00a0in his young career, spread across club and international competition. In comparison, England and Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney \u2013 who, like Bellingham, became a first team regular at the age of 16 \u2013 played 15,481 minutes before turning 21. David Beckham played almost five times less the number of minutes that Bellingham has by the same age.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/sport/fifpro-legal-action-fifa-fixture-congestion-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Video circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN showed the moment the blaze engulfed the six-story building in the Mafreg area of the city. Around 150 people were living in the block when fire broke out on the ground floor, police official Sayyed Hasan Ebrahim told Kuwaiti state television. The cause of the fire, which has been contained, is unknown but the presence of more than 20 cooking gas tanks and flammable material in the overcrowded block caused it to spread quickly, Ebrahim said. Most of the fatalities were due to suffocation, Gen. Eid Rashed, from the police criminal forensic department, told state television. He warned the death toll could rise, adding that 11 people were being treated in hospitals. Authorities had identified three of the bodies, he said, but did not say if their families had been notified. A fire department official said the large number of floors and escape corridors made it difficult for the trapped residents to escape the burning building. Indian nationals were among those killed, according to the Indian foreign ministry. The country\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the fire a \u201cmishap\u201d and described it as \u201csaddening.\u201d \u201cMy thoughts are with all those who have lost their near and dear ones.

Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov \u2013 the first of a four-ship convoy \u2013 fired a 21-gun salute after entering Havana harbor, which was answered by the Cubans with cannon fire from an 18th-century\u00a0colonial fort built by the Spanish to guard the port. The Gorshkov is one of the Russian Navy\u2019s most modern ships, and was followed by the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, a rescue tug, and an oil tanker. Onlookers and fishermen lined the seafront to watch the vessels arrive in the harbor. A CNN team on the ground saw members of the small Russian community in Cuba and Russian diplomats carrying national flags to welcome the crews. Some of the Cubans present told CNN they had never seen a submarine enter the bay of Havana before. The four Russian ships are now docked in berths usually occupied by cruise ships. It marks the largest show of force by the Russians with their longstanding ally Cuba in many years. The US assesses that the Kazan does not have nuclear weapons on board, a US official said. The vessels will carry out a five-day official visit to the Caribbean island \u2013 a show of Russian force just 90 miles from Florida as tensions rise between the US and Russia over the war in Ukraine. Cubans will be permitted to tour the frigate following the arrival of the convoy of ships, a Russian diplomatic source told CNN. The Russian diplomat told CNN that starting Thursday, \u201cthe general public\u201d in\u00a0Cuba\u00a0will be allowed to tour the Gorshkov frigate for four hours each day for three days. Military analysts believe it is capable of long-range missions, anti-submarine warfare, and carrying\u00a0surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, among other weapons\u00a0systems. US Navy \u2018monitors\u2019 exercises En route to Cuba, the Russian warships conducted drills in the Atlantic, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Tuesday. The crews of the frigate and the nuclear submarine missile cruiser practiced the use of high-precision missile weapons using computer simulation for naval targets, designating ship groupings of a simulated enemy located at a distance of over 600 km, according to the Russian MOD, Russian state media TASS\u00a0reports. US officials told CNN that the\u00a0US\u00a0military\u00a0had deployed ships and planes to monitor Russia\u2019s\u00a0military\u00a0exercises in the Atlantic and the Caribbean,\u00a0and has been\u00a0tracking\u00a0the Russian vessels as they transited the Atlantic in recent days en route to Cuba. US\u00a0Navy ships that have been\u00a0tracking\u00a0the Russian vessels include the\u00a0USS Truxtun, the\u00a0USS Donald Cook, and Coast Guard vessel the\u00a0USCGC Stone, the\u00a0US\u00a0official confirmed. The\u00a0US\u00a0has also deployed air\u00a0assets, including a P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance plane, to circle overhead the Russian vessels. Canada has also deployed\u00a0assets\u00a0to monitor the activity, the official said.

Speculation regarding the Australian star\u2019s future has been swirling for months, with many questioning if she would leave the west London side following the departure of manager Emma Hayes, who left to take charge of the US Women\u2019s team at the end of last season. Kerr, one of the best players in women\u2019s soccer, ended such speculation by signing a new deal until 2026, but not before she and the club teased fans about what the 30-year-old might do. On Thursday, Chelsea initially released a video on social media of Kerr addressing the fans, thanking them for the memories and reassuring fans that she will \u201calways be Chelsea.\u201d This style of content has become commonplace with soccer clubs when star players announce they are leaving. Many fans took to social media in disbelief, while rival supporters welcomed the decision in the hope that Chelsea\u2019s reign of dominance could be coming to an end. However, 20 minutes later, Chelsea revealed a plot twist, announcing the two-year deal. \u201cDid you guys really think I was gonna end on 99 goals?\u201d asked Kerr in another video. According to BBC Sport, it was Kerr\u2019s idea to tease the fans around the news of the contract extension. Since signing from the Chicago Red Stars in 2019, Kerr has scored 99 goals in 128 matches for Chelsea. She has won five consecutive WSL titles, three FA Cups, two League Cups and the Community Shield during her time at the club. Kerr has also been the WSL\u2019s top goal scorer twice and was runner-up to Barcelona superstar Aitana Bonmati at last year\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or awards. She is also Australia\u2019s record goalscorer and one of the most recognisable faces in world soccer. However, European success in the Champions League continues to elude both Kerr and the Blues. Kerr has not played since January 2024 and has been ruled out of this year\u2019s Olympic Games after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury at the start of the year. Former Chelsea manager Hayes had made it her mission to convince Kerr to move to the WSL club back in 2019.

Activists point to the city\u2019s Spring-Summer 2022 showcase, featuring the late Fola Francis \u2014 the first-ever transgender person\u00a0to be cast by labels to model on the city\u2019s catwalk.\u00a0 Francis tragically drowned in December 2023. While her debut was hailed as a watershed moment in both African fashion and for the queer community at large (she walked twice, for labels Cute-Saint and Fruch\u00e9), it also sparked controversy. At the time, Francis said she faced a public backlash from some sections of Nigerian society\u00a0and pointed out that despite her boundary-breaking appearances, no images of her were posted on\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week\u2019s social media accounts.\u00a0In\u00a0an interview with digital LGBTQ magazine Xtra\u00a0shortly after the event in November 2022, Francis said \u201cI heard the\u00a0Lagos Fashion Week\u2019s team decided not to post any of my pictures from the runway or include (them) in any press releases. Why am I not surprised?\u201d (The magazine said they approached\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week at the time, who did not respond to their requests for comment.) After casting non-binary models to walk on its catwalk during the Spring-Summer 2023 shows, subversive fashion house Maxivive had its show cancelled by organizers just days before it was meant to go ahead. While brand founder Papa Oyeyemi told CNN he would prefer not to talk about the cancellation, discussion within the industry centered around the presentation having been deemed \u201ctoo gay\u201d by organizers. \u201cFor the presentation to get cancelled at the last minute was very disheartening,\u201d one non-binary model booked to walk for Maxivive told CNN (they wished to remain anonymous for their safety). \u201cQueer people exist in Nigeria and fashion is meant to be expressive, not restrictive.\u201d Tosin Ogundadegbe, a Lagos-based fashion stylist\u00a0known as \u201cThe Style Infidel\u201d on social\u00a0media said that the fashion industry in Nigeria still has a long way to go when it comes to\u00a0inclusivity. \u201cThe traditional fashion schedule suffers from (a lack of) inclusivity on the runway \u2014 we only see representation of marginalized communities at private shows.\u201d Finding the freedom to be who you are Indeed, amid what\u2019s perceived as a growing pressure for organizers to adhere to anti-gay laws and increasingly divisive politics around gender, sexuality and inclusivity in Nigeria, an increasing number of fashion labels have chosen to show \u201coff-schedule\u201d via \u201cunderground\u201d private presentations where they feel they can be more free to embody the ethos of their brands, rather than in the glare of\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week. From labels such as\u00a0Tzar Studios,\u00a0a \u201cvisually provocative contemporary menswear brand\u2026 inspired by the ethos of the metrosexual man,\u201d to\u00a0ready-to-wear brand\u00a0Weiz Dhurm Franklyn, these\u00a0clandestine, \u201cinvite only\u201d shows are curated by designers who keep locations discreet and hand-pick trusted journalists, influencers, celebrities and fashion industry figures to sit in the audience. Udiahgebi, a fashion brand known for its androgynous pieces, has successfully hosted private shows in this way. The house\u00a0cast five non-binary models to walk in its first-ever runway show in 2022 to a positive reception, brand creative director Chiemerie Udiahgebi Ugwoke told CNN. \u201cThe feedback after my show was\u00a0alarmingly good,\u201d they wrote over email. \u201cI was not expecting positive reviews from the attendees because\u2026 I took gender-neutral clothes (featuring see-through fabrics, animal prints and cut-outs) and played with them in a way I felt was more likely to attract negative reviews\u00a0considering the society we live in.\u201d Aso Nigeria, another androgynous and inclusive fashion label, cast Fola Francis in both its\u00a0private runway show in December 2022\u00a0and a fashion advertising campaign released in February 2024.\u00a0Brand founder\u00a0Aanuoluwa Ajide-Daniels told CNN that including a trans woman was \u201cessential to the idea of the brand, and something that will be seen throughout the lifespan of Aso.\u201d \u201cI see fashion as art, it is meant to start a conversation and also provoke thought,\u201d said Kayode Timileyin. \u201cHowever, over the years, (Lagos) Fashion Week continues to hush down and limit these conversations.\u201d\u00a0While championing an inclusive future for the artists and fashion designers of Africa cannot solely be done behind closed doors; for now, many designers believe it is the only \u2014 and an essential \u2014 way to be able to freely express who they are.

{"id": "2024_06_12_china_china-stabbing-us-survivor-recount-intl-hnk", "text": "An American college instructor has recounted the horror of surviving a stabbing attack in China, offering the first personal account of an incident that has been given limited media coverage within the country. David Zabner is one of four Cornell College instructors attacked Monday while visiting a busy public park in\u00a0the northeast Chinese city of Jilin, where they were teaching on a partnership program with a local university. Police in Jilin said they \u201cquickly arrived at the scene\u201d and \u201cswiftly apprehended\u201d a 55-year-old man. The suspect, identified by his surname Cui,\u00a0\u201ccollided with a foreigner while walking,\u201d then stabbed the victim, according to a police statement. Three other foreigners and a Chinese person who attempted to intervene were also stabbed by the suspect, police said. The statement did not address the suspect\u2019s motive for the attack and said the investigation was ongoing. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said police believe the stabbing was an \u201cisolated incident,\u201d based on preliminary assessment. \u201cPolice told us that he was unemployed and down on his luck, and that somebody in our group bumped into the man,\u201d Zabner told\u00a0Iowa Public Radio News from his hospital room. \u201cAnd he decided to respond in the way he responded.\u201d Zabner said he first realized something was wrong when he heard a scream while descending a hill in Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in Jilin city center. \u201cI turned around to find a man brandishing a knife at me. I didn\u2019t immediately realize what was happening. I thought my coworkers had been pushed, and he, for some reason was trying to push me,\u201d Zabner said. \u201cAnd then I looked down at my shoulder and realized, \u2018I\u2019m bleeding. I\u2019ve been stabbed.\u2019\u201d Zabner was stabbed in the arm 6 inches below his shoulder, and paramedics arrived roughly 20 minutes later, he told Iowa Public Radio News. Chinese police said the five victims were immediately rushed to hospital and did not suffer life-threatening injuries. In online footage and photos purportedly showing the aftermath of the attack, Zabner was lying on his side and using his phone in between two other wounded instructors, with the back of his shirt soaked in blood. The videos and photos emerged on Chinese social media on Monday but were swiftly erased by censors, along with any discussions about the stabbing. There were no visible signs of increased security at Beishan Park when a CNN team visited the scene of the attack at around dusk on Tuesday. The scenic spot was busy with families and retirees alike, with many gathering on the banks of its lake while others danced in a square. Limited coverage The attack comes at a delicate moment for China, which has been seeking to lure back foreign visitors following three years of stringent Covid-19 border controls. It also comes amid efforts to boost educational exchanges with the US as the two countries try to stabilize their fraught relationship. Following an initial silence, Chinese state media later briefly reported on statements provided by the Foreign Ministry and Jilin police \u2013 while adhering closely to the official account. On social media, some users expressed concerns about the attack\u2019s potential impact on China\u2019s global image and the willingness of foreigners to visit the country. Others appeared to question the official account, and blamed \u201canti-Western\u201d and \u201canti-foreigner propaganda\u201d as well as the rise of nationalism, for the incident. Three of the instructors are US citizens, and the other is a non-citizen resident of Iowa, according to the US State Department. US Ambassador Nicholas Burns said Monday he was \u201cangered and deeply troubled\u201d by the stabbing. \u201cA US consular Officer visited the 4 in Jilin Hospital today where they are receiving treatment. We are doing all we can to help them (and) hope for their full recovery,\u201d he said in a post on X. This was Zabner\u2019s second trip to China with Cornell College, which has partnered with Beihua University in Jilin since 2018. Zabner joined the program in November 2019 to teach computer science courses at Beihua University, according to Iowa Public Radio News. \u201cI was really excited to get to see it in the summer,\u201d he told the radio station. Zabner\u2019s brother, Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner, told CNN that his sibling was \u201cdoing well\u201d and \u201chas been stitched up and seems to be recovering,\u201d after speaking to him on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely grateful that my brother is OK and that he survived this attack,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe hope of my family is to get my brother back home as soon as possible and get them healthy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/china/china-stabbing-us-survivor-recount-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_africa_malawi-vice-president-saulos-chilima-killed-intl", "text": "Malawi\u2019s Vice President Saulos Chilima has been killed in a plane crash along with nine other passengers, the country\u2019s President Lazarus Chakwera announced Tuesday. The aircraft went missing after it failed to land at the Mzuzu International Airport, about 380 km (240 miles) to the north of the capital Lilongwe. The wreckage of the plane has been located, Chakwera said in an address to the nation. \u201cThe search and rescue operation I ordered to find the missing plane that carried our vice president and nine others has been completed. The plane has been found. And I am deeply saddened and sorry to inform you that it has turned out to be a terrible tragedy,\u201d Chakwera\u00a0said. The Malawian leader disclosed that the aircraft was found \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d near a hill in the Chikangawa\u00a0Forest in northern Malawi, adding that \u201cwords cannot describe how heartbreaking this is.\u201d Chakwera paid tribute to his deputy, describing him as \u201ca good man, a devoted father and husband, (and) a patriotic citizen who served his country with distinction.\u201d \u201cHis passing is a terrible loss to his wife, Mary, his family, his friends, his colleagues in the cabinet and to all of us as a nation,\u201d Chakwera said in his address from the Malawian capital. The president also mourned the loss of the other passengers onboard. The Malawian leader highlighted the tragic nature of the accident, telling journalists that he had himself previously traveled on the same aircraft. \u201cYet despite the track record of the aircraft and the experience of the crew, something terrible went wrong with that aircraft on its flight back to Lilongwe,\u201d he added. On Monday evening, the president had told journalists that air traffic control had advised the vice president\u2019s plane against trying to land, and recommended turning back to the capital due to poor visibility. Not long after, the authorities lost contact with the aircraft, and started a search operation. Earlier on Tuesday, the Malawi Defence Force said it had deployed drones and at least 200 soldiers to search for the plane at the Chikangawa\u00a0Forest reserve where signals of its whereabouts were last received. The Force Commander Paul Valentino Phiri said rescue operations had been delayed by bad weather conditions. The vice president and nine other victims will all be laid to rest in \u201ca dignified manner,\u201d Chakwera said. Their remains arrived in the capital Tuesday evening and were received by Chakwera, live visuals showed. The country will observe a 21-day national mourning for Chilima and the other officials killed in the crash. The mourning period will start on June 11 and last until July 1, according to a statement from the president\u2019s office. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \u201cvery saddened\u201d to hear of the plane crash. \u201cWe offer condolences to their families and we stand with the people of Malawi at this sad time,\u201d he said. Chilima, 51, had arrived back in\u00a0Malawi\u00a0on June 6 after attending the Korea-Africa\u00a0Summit in Seoul last week. He first served as deputy to former President Peter Mutharika between 2014 and 2019 before being sworn in as vice president for a second time in 2020. An economist, Chilima previously headed Airtel Malawi, the first Malawian to lead the telecommunications company. \u201cI consider it one of the greatest honors of my life to have had him as my deputy and counsellor for the past four years,\u201d President Chakwera said. Chilima is\u00a0survived\u00a0by his wife Mary and two children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/africa/malawi-vice-president-saulos-chilima-killed-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_sassy-wyatt-blind-girl-adventures", "text": "On a recent trip to New York City, Sassy Wyatt stood atop the Empire State Building, the wind in her hair, soaking up the experience. \u201cI heard a helicopter flying by, I heard the sirens, I heard the birds, I heard people around me. I could smell the kind of the grittiness of the air \u2013 where it\u2019s part clean air and part dusty is the only way I can explain it. And then feeling the kind of rattling \u2013 that\u2019s what it felt like, the rattling \u2013 of the building underneath my feet,\u201d Wyatt tells CNN Travel. \u201cI realized how high up I was.\u201d Wyatt, who is now in her early thirties, lost her sight completely about a decade ago. The recent trip to New York was her second time in the city. She also visited before she became blind, back when she was 16. As she stood at the top of the Empire State Building, Wyatt reflected on the difference between these two trips. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really tell the enormity and the vastness of where I was in retrospect to when I was sighted, at 16 years old,\u201d says Wyatt. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell the scale of the size of the buildings and the vast expanse of what I could see beyond, and how everything got tinier and tinier and tinier, the further away it was. Of course I couldn\u2019t experience that in the same way that a sighted person can.\u201d But Wyatt felt like she had a greater appreciation of the \u201cessence\u201d of New York City this time round, as she focused on absorbing the city with her other four senses. Plus, standing next to Wyatt on her 102nd floor was her best friend, who described the view of the sea of skyscrapers \u201cin her words, through her eyes.\u201d And as she stood there, Wyatt had an acute sense of the spirit, the atmosphere of New York. The city felt \u201cfun and exciting and overwhelming.\u201d The experience brought \u201cthe city to life to me, in a different way,\u201d says Wyatt. And for Wyatt, this experience epitomizes why she loves traveling \u2013 because, not despite of, the fact she\u2019s lost her sight. \u201cI really do believe that my blindness has actually opened up the world to help me see it better,\u201d Wyatt says. Losing her sight Wyatt grew up in the UK with parents who prioritized travel. She recalls happy times spent on \u201ccamping trips, caravan trips and then further afield to Europe for one-, sometimes two-week all-inclusives.\u201d Then, aged seven, Wyatt broke her arm (\u201cI was trying to \u2018out tomboy\u2019 my friend \u2013 jump off the swing at the highest point and do all the crazy stuff that 6-,7-,8-year-olds do.\u201d) A broken arm was unfortunate, but didn\u2019t seem like anything much to worry about. No one was overly concerned until shortly after the injury, when Wyatt started experiencing unexplained swelling across her body. Doctors investigated and Wyatt was diagnosed with arthritis, which had started attacking her organs, causing swelling and discomfort. She spent much of her childhood as a wheelchair user. Then, at 14, the arthritis started to impact Wyatt\u2019s eyesight. \u201cI started to have a lot of inflammation and pain in my eyes, and my eyes were getting very painful, as well as bloodshot,\u201d recalls Wyatt. \u201cMy vision started to go a bit blurry.\u201d In her late teens, Wyatt was registered blind, although she still retained some of her vision. It was a blow, but Wyatt\u2019s parents had fostered in her a strong belief that \u201ctravel was for everybody.\u201d She\u2019d traveled as a wheelchair user through most of her childhood and her family had adopted the attitude of, \u201c\u2018we\u2019ll figure it out \u2013 if we don\u2019t have the answer, we\u2019ll find someone that does,\u2019\u201d as Wyatt puts it. So Wyatt went into her early adulthood with that mindset \u2013 sure, her sight was failing, but she wanted to experience college life, to go to bars and clubs with her friends, to travel and enjoy life. On vacation, she enjoyed paragliding and winter sports. \u201cI felt really empowered as a disabled person being able to do activities, like skiing, which is an adventure sport,\u201d Wyatt recalls. But then, in her early twenties, Wyatt lost her vision entirely. She was in the middle of a college degree and felt lost. She temporarily lost confidence in everything, dropped out of university, and faced down a slew of job rejections. \u201cI took about two years to physically get back on my feet, deal with my situation, get support for my mental health, my physical health,\u201d Wyatt says. \u201cI did fall into a state of depression. But I also realized that I didn\u2019t want life to stop. So I started volunteering in my local area, and giving back to people who were in the sight loss community.\u201d During this period, Wyatt slowly regained a sense of self and purpose. She started dating her now husband, a long-term friend who was there for her during this tough time. \u201cAnd the more I built my own confidence, getting back on my feet, the more I was like, \u2018I would like to see the world. I don\u2019t want my blindness to stop me seeing the world.\u2019\u201d It was this mindset that led Wyatt and her partner to RSVP \u2018yes\u2019 to a friend\u2019s wedding in Malta in 2016. It was to be Wyatt\u2019s first trip abroad since losing her sight. The couple tried to travel without any expectations, without putting any undue pressure on themselves. \u201cWe just had it as a break, and as a quite relaxing holiday where I got to see my friend get married,\u201d says Wyatt. \u201cExcept for the fact that I broke my leg whilst in Malta\u2026We look at it now, especially, as quite an amusing experience that the first time I ever plucked up the courage to go and be abroad, completely blind, I go throw myself off a cliff and break my leg.\u201d It wasn\u2019t an ideal outcome, but Wyatt wasn\u2019t deterred by this bump in the road. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have a fear of traveling or leaving my country or leaving my own front door,\u201d she says, adamantly. \u201cBecause accidents can happen at any time to anybody, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re blind or not.\u201d Plus, on Wyatt\u2019s next trip abroad she had extra support, in the form of her guide dog, Ida. The duo headed to Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, to attend a travel conference. It was the first time Wyatt had traveled on a plane solo \u2013 or at least \u201cwithout another human.\u201d She wasn\u2019t really alone, Ida was there by her side the whole time. Ida\u2019s role in Wyatt\u2019s life was transformative. When the duo travel, she guides Wyatt through the airport, through train stations, and helps her find her way in hotel rooms, vacation rentals, on cruise ships. \u201cI feel like she\u2019s given me my brain power back,\u201d says Wyatt of her guide dog. \u201cShe allowed me to get lost, but feel safe getting lost.\u201d Traveling the globe Around the time Ida entered Wyatt\u2019s life, Wyatt started a blog, called Blind Girl Adventures, chronicling her travels. Wyatt grew her following quickly, and started going to more travel conferences and industry meet-ups. Along the way, she met people who traveled for a living and realized that, while they all shared a passion for traveling, Wyatt was often one of the only disabled people in the room. \u201cPeople were interested in my lived experience. How I travel, how I do things and how other destinations can make their marketing or their digital inclusion or their hotels, their clients \u2013 the whole aspect of travel \u2013 how they could make it better for disabled people,\u201d says Wyatt. \u201cAnd then that light bulb flicked on. I realized I could scale this into making it into a career.\u201d Today, Wyatt works full-time as a travel and accessibility consultant, with a goal to \u201chelp change the landscape of accessible tourism.\u201d On social media and on her blog, she speaks candidly about her experiences \u2013 the good and the bad. She posts videos explaining how she takes in the inflight safety demonstrations and blogs about how to book special assistance in the airport. Wyatt\u2019s honest about the frustrations and limitations of traveling while blind \u2013 such as the need to arrive at airports much earlier than other travelers. She also embraces humor, and gives her followers tips and ideas of what to do on their vacations. \u201cWhen I travel, it\u2019s about embracing the moment,\u201d says Wyatt. \u201cWhether that\u2019s meeting a local person in a cafe and speaking to them about how they built their business, or being on an excursion with a bunch of travel bloggers and when the tour guide says, \u2018Hey who fancies hiking down the side of the gorge?\u2019 being the only one to say \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d Wyatt always does a lot of research before undertaking a trip \u2013 usually looking at blogs, books and articles to get a sense of her destination. \u201cMost people, if they\u2019re traveling and really trying to throw you into the experience that they\u2019ve had, they will write with all five senses \u2013 how they\u2019ve seen it and how they\u2019ve expressed it and how it made them feel,\u201d says Wyatt. Wyatt engages with podcasts and travel videos too \u2013 she especially enjoys when the footage includes the natural soundtrack of \u201cthe birds in the background, or the motorbike whizzing by.\u201d When film clips get overlaid with music, Wyatt finds it a bit frustrating. Before heading on the airplane, Wyatt also studies the language of her destination and learns key phrases so she can explain her needs and requirements to hoteliers, Uber drivers and anyone else she might come into contact with. Then, when Wyatt arrives at her destination, she approaches the experience with an open mind \u2013 happy to put all her research to one side if need be. \u201cWhat I love about travel is the unknown excitement that you can get from it,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, you can plan it to the nth degree, and you can have an itinerary that makes your time worthwhile in that country or in that destination. But it\u2019s about saying yes to the unexpected, and seeing where it takes you.\u201d \u2018Open book\u2019 Wyatt describes herself as an \u201copen book\u201d who loves making new connections when she travels. She enjoys chatting to strangers on buses and trains, answering their questions and enlightening them on the reality of her experience as a blind woman traveling the world. Meanwhile on social media, Wyatt loves it when she can \u201cconvert\u201d someone who approaches her page with negativity or skepticism and instead invite them into her world. For example, one of the most common questions she gets is how can she read the Instagram comments and reply if she can\u2019t see. In response, Wyatt will politely explain that she uses the accessibility features inbuilt within smart phones. Wyatt also gets some commentors question her love of traveling. \u201cPeople ask me: \u2018If you can\u2019t see, why would you bother traveling?\u2019\u201d Wyatt says. In response, Wyatt tells them about how she engages with places with her other senses, and gets to know destinations in different ways. And while she comes face-to-face with the occasional troll, Wyatt is largely followed by people who are inspired and entertained by her content \u2013 from people looking to be better allies to disabled travelers to people who live with disabilities themselves. Wyatt isn\u2019t necessarily setting out to be inspirational \u2013 she\u2019s just being herself, and is always looking to learn from others\u2019 experiences too. Still, she loves getting messages from people who say her content has motivated them to travel to a big city with their visually impaired child for the first time, or prompted them to book a trip they\u2019ve been anxious about, knowing their guide dog will be in tow. While Wyatt has a positive mindset, she is also open about the limitations she experiences. Navigating airports can be difficult, for example. Public transport options can be frustratingly limited. And Wyatt\u2019s only traveled with her guide dog within Europe, where she feels protected under European accessibility access laws, and because taking Ida further afield could be complicated. On her honeymoon to Jamaica, for example, Wyatt left Ida at home as she was concerned her dog \u2013 used to cold British climes \u2013 wouldn\u2019t adapt well to the heat. Despite Ida\u2019s absence, it was a fantastic trip and Wyatt and her husband made the vacation work for them both. Wyatt says her husband is a great travel partner and \u201can excellent guide.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s very good at describing the world around me,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s very good at explaining things in museums, and he loves people-watching \u2013 so he explains things like that to me, which I find really fascinating.\u201d Wyatt and her husband are a good team, but they do have slightly different travel styles \u2013 Wyatt\u2019s husband would happily lie on a beach all day or restaurant-hop, while she\u2019s more of an adrenaline junkie. She loves \u201ckayaking, or rock climbing, or ziplining, things like that \u2013 even just hikes.\u201d In general, Wyatt always enjoys feeling that she\u2019s \u201cat one with nature, at one with the people that I\u2019m with.\u201d And while she\u2019s always been a bit of a thrillseeker, Wyatt suggests there is also a correlation between her love of adventure sports and her lack of vision. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have sight to appreciate the thrill of adventure,\u201d explains Wyatt. She adores experiencing \u201cthe wind rushing through your hair and your clothes when you\u2019re on a zipline\u201d or feeling the gushing water and \u201ceveryone screaming with laughter or bashing off the riverbanks and stuff and people getting stuck\u201d during white water rafting. \u201cI just find the chaos of that [adventure sports] fun,\u201d says Wyatt, laughing. Enjoying the moment While these adventurous moments are some of the highlights of Wyatt\u2019s travels, she also enjoys the quieter calmer moments of reflection. She recalls a moment in Malta, on that first trip she took after losing her sight. She was \u201cstanding on the beach with my toes curled into the sand, feeling the heat press upon me, and listening to the waves lap against the seashore.\u201d Wyatt remembers \u201cjust breathing in that fresh sea air, and being surrounded by nature, its beauty, and feeling significant and yet completely insignificant.

{"id": "2024_06_13_middleeast_hamas-interview-israel-gaza-hostages-intl", "text": "The fate of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza is crucial to any deal to end the protracted and bloody conflict between Israel and Hamas. But a senior Hamas official has told CNN that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many of them are alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of\u00a0a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Hamas spokesperson and political bureau member Osama Hamdan offered an insight into the militant group\u2019s position on the stalled ceasefire talks, a view on whether Hamas regrets its decision to attack Israel given the mounting Palestinian death toll, and a commentary on the leak earlier this week of messages from its chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, the man believed to be the ultimate decision-maker on any peace deal. The US believes that Hamas holds the key to the talks. \u201cThe haggling has to stop,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NBC on Thursday, urging Sinwar to end the war. \u201cHe\u2019s relatively safe underground; the people that he purports to represent, they\u2019re suffering every day.\u201d Speaking to CNN in the Lebanese capital Beirut, Hamdan said the latest proposal on the table \u2013 an Israeli plan that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden late last month \u2013 did not meet the group\u2019s demands for an end to the war. Hamdan told CNN that Hamas needed \u201ca clear position from Israel to accept the ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from Gaza, and let the Palestinians to determine their future by themselves, the reconstruction, the (lifting) of the siege \u2026 and we are ready to talk about a fair deal about the prisoners exchange.\u201d Negotiations over the US-backed proposal have intensified in recent days but appeared to grind to a halt on Wednesday after Hamas presented its response to the document, 12 days after first receiving it. Blinken expressed frustration over what he said was Hamas\u2019s decision to submit \u201cnumerous changes,\u201d describing some of them as going \u201cbeyond positions (Hamas) had previously taken.\u201d \u201cSome of the changes are workable. Some are not,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Doha on Wednesday. The US-backed ceasefire plan that was approved by the United Nations Security Council on Monday lays out a phased approach. In the first phase, there would be a six-week ceasefire in which some hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and the Israeli military would pull out of populated areas in Gaza. The second phase \u2013 a permanent end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2013 would only be implemented after further negotiations between the two sides. But Hamdan told CNN the duration of the ceasefire was a key issue for Hamas, which is concerned that Israel has no intention of following through with the second phase of the deal. The end of hostilities must be permanent, he said, and Israel must withdraw from Gaza completely. \u201cThe Israelis want the ceasefire only for six weeks and then they want to go back to the fight, which I think the Americans, till now, they did not convince the Israelis to accept (a\u00a0permanent ceasefire),\u201d he said, adding that he believes the US needs to convince Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire as part of the deal. Israel has not yet publicly committed to the deal, even though the White House has repeatedly stressed that it was an Israeli plan that the government had accepted. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been under pressure to announce his support for the current plan, has repeatedly said that the war will not end until Israel eliminates Hamas. Blinken told NBC that Netanyahu \u201creconfirmed\u201d to him \u201cthat Israel supported this proposal and was ready to say yes\u201d when he saw him couple of days ago, and placed the blame for stalled negotiations squarely on Hamas. \u201cHamas has to demonstrate that it too wants this to end. If it does, we can bring it to an end. If it doesn\u2019t, then it means that it wants the war to continue,\u201d Blinken said. Question of responsibility Speaking to CNN inside a modest office decorated with a large map of Gaza and panoramic photo of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Hamdan repeatedly deflected any questions about Hamas\u2019 role in the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. He called the October 7 terror attacks, which sparked the current war in Gaza, \u201ca reaction against the occupation.\u201d The October 7 attack was the deadliest assault in Israel\u2019s history. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and also took some 250 people hostage into Gaza. Israel was quick to retaliate, immediately declaring war on Hamas and launching an intense campaign of bombardment followed by a ground invasion several weeks later. That operation has had a devastating impact on the Palestinians of Gaza. More than 37,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the strip. Some 90% of people living in the territory are estimated to have been displaced by the fighting. While the Gazan authorities do not distinguish between casualties among civilians and Hamas fighters, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has previously admitted the majority of those killed in the operation were civilians. Asked repeatedly by CNN whether Hamas regretted its decision to attack Israel, Hamdan responded by blaming the situation on Israel and saying the attack was \u201ca reaction against the occupation.\u201d \u201cThe one who is in charge or responsible for that is (the Israeli) occupation. If you resist the occupation, (they) will kill you, if you did not resist the occupation, (they) also will kill you and deport you out of your country. So what we are supposed to do, just to wait?,\u201d he said. Hamdan also dismissed as fake reports that Sinwar suggested the deaths of thousands of Palestinians were \u201cnecessary sacrifices.\u201d Sinwar has not been seen in public since the October 7 attacks. He is believed to be hiding in Gaza, somewhere inside the tunnel network that runs underneath the strip. He has been designated as a terrorist by the US, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians in Gaza as human shields and earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal published what it said were leaked messages from Sinwar to other Hamas leaders in which he allegedly expressed an uncompromising determination to continue fighting, regardless of the human cost. Hamdan told CNN the messages \u201cwere fake.\u201d \u201cIt was fake messages done by someone who is not Palestinian and (it) was sent (to the) Wall Street Journal as part of the pressure against Hamas and provoking the people against the leader,\u201d he said without providing evidence. \u201cNo one can accept the killing of the Palestinians, of his own people.\u201d Destroying Hamas? When Israel launched its war on Hamas, Netanyahu said the objectives were to \u201cdestroy Hamas and bring back hostages held in Gaza.\u201d But more than eight months on, the goal of eliminating the group completely appears unachievable. While the IDF has killed some Hamas commanders, the top leadership in Gaza, including Sinwar, continues to evade them. And despite the damage caused to its infrastructure, Hamas also continues to fire rockets towards Israel, albeit much more sporadically than at the outset of the conflict. American intelligence officials believe that Sinwar likely believes Hamas can survive Israel\u2019s attempt to destroy it. At the same time, Netanyahu is under increasing pressure to reach a deal that would secure the return of the remaining hostages still in Gaza. Israel believes that more than 70 hostages of the more than 100 who are still held in Gaza to be alive. Speaking to CNN, Hamdan said he didn\u2019t know how many were still alive. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea about that. No one has an idea about this,\u201d he said, alleging \u2013 without providing any evidence \u2013 that the Israeli operation to free four of the hostages on Saturday resulted in the deaths of three others, including an American citizen. There are fears that more hostages may be dead than are publicly known. In April, Hamas told international mediators that it was not able to fulfill Israel\u2019s demand to free 40 of the remaining hostages in the first phase of a deal, including all the women as well as sick and elderly men, because it did not hold 40 living hostages who match those criteria for release. Asked about the testimony of a doctor who treated the released hostages and said they suffered mental and physical abuse and were beaten every hour, Hamdan again blamed Israel for their suffering. \u201cI believe if they have mental problem, this is because of what Israel have done in Gaza. Because (no one can) handle what Israel is doing, bombing each day, killing civilians, killing women and children \u2026 they saw that (with) their own eyes,\u201d he said, adding that comparing images of the hostages taken before and after the eight-months long captivity shows \u201cthey were better than before\u201d \u2013 a claim that is demonstrably false.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/middleeast/hamas-interview-israel-gaza-hostages-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Kherson and Luhansk were among four Ukrainian territories Russia claimed to have annexed in September 2022 following its full-scale invasion. The international community, aside from North Korea and Syria, does not recognize the annexation. Vladimir Saldo, the\u00a0Russia-appointed governor\u00a0of\u00a0the southern Kherson region, accused Ukrainian forces\u00a0of\u00a0killing 22 people, including a 9-year-old child, in the\u00a0shelling\u00a0of\u00a0the small town\u00a0of\u00a0Sadove on Friday. Saldo claimed that Ukrainian forces did\u00a0\u201ca double-tap\u201d missile strike on a\u00a0grocery store and the civilian area in Sadove. The grocery store, he noted, was\u00a0packed with customers and staff when it was hit.\u00a0The first attack was carried out using a French-supplied aerial bomb and the successive one with an American-supplied HIMARS missile, he told\u00a0Russia\u00a024.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the strikes \u201ccynical and [a] bloody crime\u201d on Friday and blamed Washington for giving \u201cthe green light\u201d to Kyiv \u201cto kill civilians with Western weapons.\u201d Oleksandr Prokudin, head\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Kherson region military administration, dismissed the\u00a0Russian claims in a Telegram post on Friday, calling them \u201ca vivid example\u00a0of\u00a0how\u00a0Russian propaganda works.\u201d\u00a0 Prokudin pointed to Saldo incorrectly citing the attack in Kherson region as happening on Saturday instead\u00a0of\u00a0Friday, in an insinutation the claim was made up. Artem Lysohor, head\u00a0of\u00a0Luhansk region military administration, said that the Ukrainian strikes were \u201cexclusively on the old and well-equipped military infrastructure\u00a0of\u00a0the occupiers\u201d\u00a0and blamed\u00a0Russian air defense systems for intercepting\u00a0the rockets over civilian neighborhoods, suggesting the falling debris caused casualties. Russia has been pressing in the east, which it seeks to capture in full, as it continues its assault on Ukraine\u2019s northeastern region of Kharkiv after launching a surprise offensive last month. Ukraine recorded its\u00a0highest\u00a0monthly\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0civilian\u00a0casualties\u00a0in almost one year, with the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0(HRMMU) recording a \u201csignificant increase\u201d (31%) in\u00a0civilians killed in\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0in May compared to April. \u201cOver half\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0casualties\u00a0in May occurred in Kharkiv city and region where Russian armed forces launched a new ground\u00a0offensive on 10 May,\u201d the head\u00a0of\u00a0the HRMMU Danielle Bell said.

{"id": "2024_06_13_sport_mcilroy-cantlay-us-open-pinehurst-no2-spt-intl", "text": "Rory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay emerged unscathed as Pinehurst\u2019s notorious No. 2 course sunk its teeth into the first round field at the 124th US Open on Thursday. Brutally firm and fast conditions sent scorecards spiraling in North Carolina yet Northern Ireland\u2019s McIlroy and American Cantlay tamed the beast, each shooting five-under 65 to match the tournament\u2019s lowest ever score at the venue and take an early share of the lead. Seeking to end a 10-year wait for his fifth major crown, world No. 3 McIlroy was a picture of control, avoiding a single bogey before signing off with a superb birdie putt from almost 20 feet. The omens looked good for the 35-year-old. When Germany\u2019s Martin Kaymer opened with the same score in 2014, he repeated the feat the following day before coasting to victory. The last three times McIlroy has made a bogey-free start at a major, he\u2019s gone on to lift the trophy \u2013 including at the 2011 US Open. \u201cCertainly the major championships that I\u2019ve won or the ones that I\u2019ve played well at, I\u2019ve always seemed to get off to a good start, and it\u2019s nice to get off to another one,\u201d McIlroy told reporters. \u201cThe greens are a bit more slopey and there\u2019s a bit more movement on them. But there\u2019s options. You can chip it. You can putt it. I\u2019d love if we played more golf courses like this,\u201d he added. Neck and neck is eight-time PGA Tour winner Cantlay, who poured in six birdies to shoot under 70 for the first time in nine US Open appearances and make the perfect start to his latest pursuit of a long-awaited first major. \u201cI\u2019ve been working really hard on my game, and usually when you make just a couple changes and you\u2019re working really hard, it\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d world No. 9 Cantlay told reporters. Scheffler sloppy but Aberg soars By contrast, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is already chasing his second major \u2013 and sixth win \u2013 in just his ninth start of the season, but the overwhelming tournament favorite left himself with ground to make up after opening with a one-over 71. The reigning Masters champion was uncharacteristically error-prone, hitting just six of 14 fairways. Playing partner and last month\u2019s PGA Championship victor Xander Schauffele went one better with a starting 70, while defending champion Wyndham Clark shot 73. Sweden\u2019s Ludvig Aberg heads the chasing pack at one stroke behind the leading duo, the 24-year-old continuing to cement his reputation as one of the game\u2019s brightest young stars with an opening 66. Aberg hit every fairway and missed just two greens in his first ever US Open round and just his third career major outing, having finished second on his Masters debut in April. \u201cI\u2019m very, very pleased obviously. I wouldn\u2019t want to do it again,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m always nervous when I\u2019m playing tournament golf. I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. I think the day when I\u2019m not nervous, it\u2019s not a good sign. Obviously a lot of butterflies this morning.\u201d Woods left to rue iron play Aberg is one stroke ahead of 2011 champion Bryson DeChambeau and France\u2019s Matthieu Pavon, who became the first player in history to make two eagles in a US Open round at Pinehurst No.2 after navigating the par-five 5th and 10th holes in just six total strokes. \u201cWe know how tough the course can be and even if you go in two for the par-fives, you really have to put the ball in the right spot,\u201d Pavon told reporters after shooting 67. \u201cThis is all I tried, and I succeeded. Dropped some very nice putts today too, so really a good day.\u201d Three-time US Open champion Tiger Woods made a promising start to his 23rd tournament appearance but saw his stellar early putting desert him to drop to four-over 74. Playing under a special exemption after failing to automatically qualify for a major for the first time in his professional career, the 48-year-old was one-under after six holes and was excellent off the tee throughout but was let down by his iron play and lost his early touch on the greens as five bogeys dashed his early momentum. \u201cI think I three-putted two or three times today,\u201d Woods told reporters. \u201cIf I clean that up, if I get a couple iron shots not as loose as I did, I\u2019m right there at even par. \u201cI thought I did the one thing I needed to do today, which is drive the ball well \u2026 I just didn\u2019t capitalize on any of it.\u201d Woods faired relatively well compared to three of his big name counterparts. Norway\u2019s world No. 5 Viktor Hovland slid to an opening 78, while multiple-major-winning American duo Justin Thomas and Phil Mickelson endured similarly nightmarish starts of 77 and 79 respectively. Friday\u2019s second round tees off at 6:45 a.m. EDT (11:45 a.m. BST), with only those among the top-60 and ties at the end of play progressing to the weekend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/sport/mcilroy-cantlay-us-open-pinehurst-no2-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_weather_florida-flooding-hurricane-season-climate", "text": "Multiple communities across South Florida \u2014 including the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas \u2014 flooded Wednesday amid bouts of torrential rain that prompted the state\u2019s governor to declare an emergency and stranded drivers across the region. Flood warnings are in effect Wednesday night for parts of Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier and Hendry counties through Thursday morning, according to the National Weather Service, which warned \u201clife-threatening flooding\u201d was ongoing. Flood watches were also extended for Miami and Fort Lauderdale until Friday evening. \u201cMany areas are inundated with water w/ stalled cars & more rainfall is on the way,\u201d the weather service said Wednesday night. \u201cStay off the roadways if possible.\u201d Footage on social media showed water levels in the area reaching to vehicles\u2019 windows and filing up parking decks and neighborhood streets. In Miami, video showed stranded cars that were nearly entirely submerged under water. It\u2019s the second consecutive day the Miami area has faced down flooding issues. Storms dropped 2 to 5 inches of rain and flooded streets Tuesday. In Hallandale Beach, where footage showed one man kayaking among cars as high waters flooded parts of the city, officials urged residents to shelter in place and avoid driving or walking through the water. Hallandale Beach officials said a family lost their son during the storm, but were later reunited with the help of local police who were able to find the young boy. A woman who was driving to work said she spent five hours stuck in her car along Hallandale Beach Boulevard and US Route 1 because of the flooding. \u201cThe lights were out at multiple intersections and there were already cars that were stalled and abandoned. I\u2019ve never seen it like that,\u201d Hollywood resident Kait Madrigal told CNN. Along with the heavy rainfall, the storm system also brought an EF1 tornado Wednesday to Hobe Sound, located in Martin County about 35 miles north of West Palm Beach, a National Weather Service damage survey confirmed. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared an emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade, and Sarasota counties, writing the heavy rain and floods has affected the \u201coperational capability of critical infrastructure,\u201d including major interstates, roadways, schools and airports. The severe weather also forced school officials in Broward County to postpone the demolition of the Marjory\u00a0Stoneman\u00a0Douglas High School building where a gunman killed 17 people in 2018 to Friday. Collier County School District officials announced that summer school and child care programs will be closed Thursday \u201cdue to the abundant rain causing localized flooding.\u201d \u201cFlooding at bus stops and on streets causes hazardous conditions for student and staff transportation,\u201d the district said on its\u00a0website. A month\u2019s worth of rain in one day Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis declared a local state of emergency, citing \u201cexcessive rain\u201d and flooding. City officials said the heavy rainfall led to \u201chigh water\u201d on roads across the city, adding emergency management staff were deploying high water vehicles and vacuum trucks in the area. Trantalis urged residents to remain off the streets as they continue to pump out the standing water. The city saw a preliminary rainfall total of roughly 9.58 inches Wednesday, making it Fort Lauderdale\u2019s eighth wettest day on record, according to data from the National Weather Service. \u201cEarly afternoon is when everyone was let out early from work to get home before the rain started,\u201d Trantalis told CNN. \u201cThe streets were jammed. Instead of being flooded with water, they were flooded with cars.\u201d That preliminary rainfall total is also just above Fort Lauderdale\u2019s average June rainfall of 9.55 inches \u2013 meaning the area saw over a month\u2019s worth in one day. The total is still lower than the rainiest day in the city\u2019s history in April 2023, when\u00a0around 2 feet of rain in a 24-hour period\u00a0caused severe flooding. Heavy rainfall over the last 48 hours totaled about 12.8 inches, making it the ninth\u00a0wettest two-day period for the city. The severe weather led to over 600 flight cancellations and delays across two of the region\u2019s main airports. At least 334 flights in and out of Miami International Airport were canceled and there were more than 287 flights canceled in and out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. While the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. The daily downpours are also being fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean funneling straight into South Florida along a front draped over the state. Several more inches of rain are expected through the rest of the work week  from a broad and disorganized area of storms stuck over the state. By late week, the National Hurricane Center gives the storms a low chance of organizing into the first tropical depression of hurricane season as it moves off the Southeast coast. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in parts of Florida by Friday, but a few areas in southwest Florida could approach 20 inches. The southwestern Gulf Coast of the state, from Sarasota to Everglades National Park, is at the greatest risk for rainfall totaling 10 inches or more. But bursts of intense rain outside of the highest risk areas could cause flash flooding, especially in urban or poor-drainage areas. Flood watches are in effect for more than 8 million people in South Florida Wednesday through Thursday night at the earliest. Gulf moisture continues to stream over South Florida, where the Weather Prediction Center has issed a level 2 of 4 flood threat overnight Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. An additional 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected to fall across Southeastern Florida, including Miami and Fort Lauderdale, through Friday. Rainfall storm totals over a foot are possible across much of South Florida, which is equivalent to over a month to several months\u2019 worth of rainfall. The flood risk will increase through the week as storms unload drenching rain over the same area day after day, causing rainfall totals to climb, soils to saturate and area waterways to swell. If there\u2019s any silver lining, it\u2019s the rain will be beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull\u2019s-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the US Drought Monitor. How a giant gyre of moisture leads to tropical trouble The robust moisture fueling this week\u2019s storms typically pools over parts of the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico at this point in the season into the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters. The gyre\u2019s broad spin and deep moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific when other necessary factors \u2013 including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water\u00a0\u2013 align. The gyre typically first develops around the late spring and early summer, which is one reason most June tropical systems form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the East Coast of the US. Despite plenty of bathtub warm water in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, upper-level winds, known as wind shear, are much too disruptive right now for any tropical systems to form in these areas, according to Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida. What the gyre is doing, is juicing up the wet weather across the Gulf Coast, like what Florida will endure this week. \u201cJust the mere presence of the Central American gyre forming tells us that summer is here and the rainy season is about to begin,\u201d Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida, told CNN. June, July, August and September are generally the wettest months of the year for much of Florida. Frequent surges of deep, tropical moisture and the direct impact of tropical systems send rainfall totals skyrocketing during this part of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/weather/florida-flooding-hurricane-season-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_europe_pope-francis-homophobic-slur-repeat-intl-hnk", "text": "Rome \u2014 The pope has again used a highly disparaging word against gay people for which he had already apologized\u00a0last month, ANSA news agency said on Tuesday. Italian media had attributed to the pope the use of a vulgar Italian term roughly translating as \u201cf*****ry,\u201d on\u00a0May 20\u00a0during a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops. According to ANSA, Francis repeated the term on Tuesday as he met Roman priests, saying \u201cthere is an air of f*****ry in the Vatican,\u201d and it was better that young men with a homosexual tendency not be allowed to enter the seminary. Asked about the latest report, the Vatican\u2019s press office made reference to a statement it had issued regarding Tuesday\u2019s meeting with the priests, in which the pope reiterated the need to welcome gay people into the Church and the need for caution regarding them becoming seminarians. After the initial report of his use of the word, Corriere della Sera newspaper quoted unnamed bishops who were in the room as suggesting that the pope, as an Argentine, might not have realized the Italian term he used was offensive. Last month, a source close to the pope told CNN the phrase could also be understood as there is a \u201cgay climate\u201d in the seminaries. The Vatican ruled in 2005 that the church cannot allow the ordination of men who are actively gay or have \u201cdeep-seated\u201d homosexual tendencies. In 2016, Francis upheld this ruling. Two years later he told Italian bishops not to accept gay candidates for the priesthood. Francis, 87, had been credited with making substantial overtures toward the LGBTQ community during his 11-year papacy. Some observers of the Vatican say his recent missteps undermine his authority and raise questions about his convictions and the reform path he has in mind for the Church.

{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_australian-billionaire-gaza-aid-gate-system-intl", "text": "An Australian billionaire is offering to build a secure gate system on the Israel-Gaza border that he says could allow 10,000 metric tons of food aid to be delivered each day to starving Palestinians. Andrew Forrest, founder of the philanthropic Minderoo Foundation, was set to raise the proposal Tuesday at an emergency summit on Gaza in Jordan, co-hosted by that country, Egypt and the United Nations, and attended by\u00a0US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He\u2019s also committed $5 million to improve the Jordanian humanitarian land corridor by building storage warehouses to allow more aid to pass\u00a0to Gaza. \u201cRight now, the Jordanian people are bearing a significant load by leading the single most effective route into Gaza. It is my intention to lighten their load,\u201d Forrest, a mining magnate\u00a0and avowed eco-warrior,\u00a0said in a statement. According to a video presentation on its website, Minderoo said the more ambitious plan, to build SafeGates at three points along the Israel-Gaza border, could be up and running in three weeks, if Israel gives the green light. In a separate statement, Forrest said the project had been devised in\u00a0consultation with Israel and Palestinian communities for the past two months. CNN has asked Israel for comment on the plan. The presentation added that the project has been developed by Fortescue, the iron ore mining and green energy company of which Forrest is the founder and executive chairman. SafeGates\u00a0involves installing three remotely monitored access points at undisclosed locations on the Israel-Gaza border to conduct 3D scans of trucks\u00a0delivering aid to the region as they arrive and depart. \u201cBeing located at crossing points into Gaza, the gates will be operated by a third party that will have remote monitoring capabilities over the facilities and scanning equipment and determine the\u00a0gates\u2019 operational hours,\u201d\u00a0Forrest said in the statement. \u201cThere is no cost to Israel and the plan respects red lines. On the Gazan side, we will work with the existing network of agencies, businesses, as well as Palestinian community groups for aid distribution within the Strip,\u201d he added. The deliveries would supplement other efforts to deliver aid to Palestinians who have been living under sustained bombardment by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since Hamas militants launched a deadly attack on Israel last October. During that attack, Hamas-led\u00a0militants killed around 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostages. After the\u00a0rescue of four hostages earlier this week,\u00a0around 116 are believed to still be in Gaza, alive or dead. Israel\u2019s efforts to eradicate Hamas have killed more than\u00a037,000 Palestinians since October 7, according to the Ministry of Health. The IDF has repeatedly said hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian aid have been entering the Gaza Strip, but aid organizations say the supplies are not reaching civilians in need. How would it work? A video of the\u00a0SafeGates\u00a0system shows trucks driving at an automated entry gate, where they undergo a 3D scan to identify any security issues, before being allowed to enter a secure compound. Once in the holding area, the driver leaves via a door back to Israel, while another door opens on the Gaza side, allowing a driver from the Palestinian enclave to drive the truck out of the compound. According to the video, the truck would be scanned again on the Gaza side, and once cleared, the cabin would be detached from its trailer\u00a0for the unloading of the aid,\u00a0 before reattaching and returning to\u00a0Israel via the same process. The system would work to prevent unauthorized access to the vehicles, allaying fears that aid deliveries could present an opportunity for potential attackers to cross the border. The passage of aid into Gaza has become gridlocked by Israeli inspections, and in some cases the temporary closure of access points. The US has attempted to provide aid to Gaza via airdrops, and more recently by building a floating pier to allow the delivery of supplies from various countries by boat. However, a week after its started operation, the pier broke apart in rough seas, temporarily halting aid deliveries while damaged portions were towed to Israel for repairs.\u00a0It was\u00a0reconnected last Friday. Humanitarian crisis International condemnation of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza is growing and on Monday\u00a0the United Nations Security Council\u00a0overwhelmingly approved a US-backed ceasefire plan. However, Israel vowed to continue its military operation in Gaza, saying it won\u2019t engage in \u201cmeaningless\u201d negotiations with Hamas. Meanwhile, mass hunger has created a secondary peril for Palestinians living\u00a0within\u00a0the besieged strip. In a recent\u00a0report, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), said it was \u201cpossible, if not likely\u201d that the threshold for a famine had been passed in northern Gaza in April. The thresholds to confirm a famine are an extreme lack of food in households, acute malnutrition and mortality. FEWS NET, funded by the US Agency for International Development, is a leading provider of early warning and analysis on acute food insecurity around the world. It said it wasn\u2019t possible to confirm a famine in the north because it was too dangerous to deploy people there to gather data, but it warned that conditions will worsen if more aid is not delivered soon. \u201cIt is possible\u00a0famine will persist through at least July if there is not a fundamental change in how food assistance is distributed and accessed after entering Gaza,\u201d the report warned.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/australian-billionaire-gaza-aid-gate-system-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_russia-ukraine-mariupol-hunger-war-crime-intl", "text": "A group of international human rights lawyers has accused Russia of intentionally starving the civilians of Mariupol as a method of warfare during its 85-day siege of the Ukrainian city in early 2022. A 76-page dossier published Thursday by the Starvation Mobile Justice Team of the human rights organization Global Rights Compliance\u00a0looks in detail at the siege, which it described as \u201chell on earth\u201d for the port city\u2019s residents, through the lens of the war crime of starvation as a calculated strategy. It found that Russian forces \u201csystematically attacked objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population,\u201d while at the same time cutting off evacuation routes and blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid. Ukrainian civilians were cut off from water, electricity and gas and forced to drink from puddles, radiators\u00a0and melted snow. The findings didn\u2019t come as a surprise to Nikolai Osychenko, who described living through the siege as a \u201cStone Age\u201d experience. \u201cThe Russians bombed the substation that supplied electricity to Mariupol on March 2 and we lost electricity, and at the same time, we also lost the water supply and heating,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the city started running out of food almost immediately, because without electricity, much of it has gone bad. \u201cWe all realized that flour is the best thing to have. If you have water and flour, you can cook something.\u00a0But without water, you can\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. The Mariupol resident spent two weeks living in one apartment with nine other people, rationing food and scraping together any water they could find. They would spend two days melting buckets of snow with their hand, only to get a few inches of dirty water. Osychenko told CNN that at one point, he drank the water from his radiators, boiling it 20 times over to purify it. Deliberately causing starvation and deprivation constitutes a war crime under international law. The group is in the process of submitting their latest report to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as part of a larger dossier on Russia\u2019s use of starvation. According to their website, the organization is funded by the governments of the EU Commission, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. CNN has reached out to Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense for comment. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, was encircled and captured by Russian forces at the start of\u00a0the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0Local officials estimate\u00a0that as many as 22,000\u00a0people\u00a0were killed in the battle for the city, which is located in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk Oblast and has been under direct Russian control since May 2022. \u2018Hell on earth\u2019 It was in\u00a0Mariupol\u00a0that Russian forces carried out some of their most notorious strikes, including an\u00a0attack on a maternity hospital and the\u00a0bombing of a theater\u00a0in which up to 1,300 civilians had sought refuge, according to local officials. The report,\u00a0entitled,\u00a0\u201c\u2019The Hope Left Us:\u2019\u00a0Russia\u2019s Siege, Starvation, and Capture of Mariupol City\u2019\u201d explores how \u201cpeaceful\u201d Mariupol was turned into \u201chell on earth\u201d in February 2022. It uses open-source research to analyse over 1.5 billion square meters of satellite imagery, as well as photographs, videos, official public statements, and other digital data collected between May 2022 and February 2024. Its several hundred\u00a0thousand\u00a0residents were forced to find alternative coping strategies during Russia\u2019s siege, amid dwindling supplies and the obstruction of humanitarian aid. This included the establishment of ad hoc distribution points for food, water and other basic necessities. These distribution points, however, including the\u00a0Mariupol Drama Theater\u00a0and Neptun\u00a0Swimming Pool Complex, became targets for the Russian army. \u201cSustained attacks against Mariupol City forced the distribution of essential items to become largely\u00a0mobile in order to mitigate risks of shelling, though a significant number of both mobile and stationary distribution points were still shelled, repeatedly exposing vulnerable and hungry residents to significant risk to their lives and means of securing basic necessities,\u201d the report found. It also found several instances where the delivery of vital humanitarian aid was allegedly denied or deliberately obstructed by Russian forces, while civilians were unable to evacuate from the city. \u201cDespite Russian forces\u2019 command failing to halt hostilities in order to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, aid delivery was also directly blocked by pro-Russian forces operating at checkpoints erected around evacuation corridors between Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia.\u201d 85-day offensive Osychenko said he and his family survived the ordeal thanks to his wife\u2019s and niece\u2019s careful planning. \u201cThey were in charge of food and they divided the food very clearly: so much porridge, so much this and so much that for the day. Once I caught them not eating at all. They cooked for us but they didn\u2019t eat because they knew that there was nowhere to get food, and there was less and less of it,\u201d he said. Yousuf Syed Khan, a senior lawyer with law firm Global Rights Compliance, told CNN\u00a0he believes\u00a0there was no doubt that the siege of Mariupol amounted to a war crime. \u201cThey [the Russian army] did not allow for international organizations to provide civilian evacuations\u2026 even though the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as well as the United Nations attempted numerous times to evacuate civilians. \u201cNumber two is that they did not allow the entry of humanitarian aid. So not once through the 85-day offensive was there any pause in which they allowed humanitarian aid to enter Mariupol.\u201d Khan continued: \u201cOn top of that, they were attacking indispensable objects. They were attacking electricity, they were attacking water. They were attacking food distribution points.\u201d There\u00a0were numerous opportunities for Russian forces to alleviate civilian suffering,\u00a0he said, but they failed to\u00a0do so. Osychenko said that with each day, the situation was getting more and more desperate. Mothers that had small children, many of them \u00a0lost milk from the stress and hunger, there was no formula, no children food,\u201d he said. When Russian troops took over the city, they tried to take advantage of the desperate situation. \u201cWhen Russia came to the city, when they started delivering food to people in basements, giving candies to children, even if you hate Russia, you will go out to them and take it. Because you have nothing to eat, your kids have nothing to drink. It\u2019s brutal,\u201d he said. Khan said the way Moscow\u00a0approached the siege was part of a broader strategy\u00a0that\u00a0Russian and pro-Russian forces have used regularly in the past eight years. He pointed to sieges laid by pro-Russian forces across Syria, including those in\u00a0eastern Aleppo City\u00a0and Ghouta, as examples of heavy-handed Russian tactics. Ukrainian authorities and some international officials have previously accused\u00a0Russia of robbing the country of grain\u00a0and other commodities in areas it occupied.\u00a0Accusations that Russia is using food as a\u00a0weapon of war\u00a0have been mounting ever since the first reports emerged in the spring of 2022 of grain being stolen by Russian troops. The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Ukraine. It has so far issued four arrest warrants related to Ukraine, including for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the alleged deportation of Ukrainian children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/russia-ukraine-mariupol-hunger-war-crime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a news briefing Tuesday, the South Korean military\u00a0appeared to downplay the significance of the gunfire, saying the North Korean soldiers quickly retreated and\u00a0did not appear to have the intention of invading the southern side, based on information that cannot be made public. \u201cThere were no unusual movements other than the North Korean army immediately moving north after our warning shots,\u201d said Col.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

The ban, called the \u201cLeahy Law,\u201d prohibits any military assistance or training to be provided to foreign units held responsible for human rights violations, according to the US State Department. The battalion, named the 12th Special Forces Azov Brigade, was integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard in 2023, after the initial formation dissolved. The unit has been praised for its role in the fight against Russian occupation in the Mariupol area. The unit welcomed the lifting of the ban on receiving security assistance from the US, saying in a statement Tuesday, \u201cThis is a new page in the history of our unit.\u201d \u201cEligibility for US assistance will not only increase Azov\u2019s combat effectiveness, but, most importantly, will help save the lives and health of the brigade\u2019s personnel,\u201d the unit said. \u201cAzov is becoming more professional and more effective in defending Ukraine against the invaders.\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the US decision on Tuesday, saying the US is \u201cready even to flirt with neo-Nazis,\u201d according to Russian state news agency TASS. Major battles Founded as a militia to defend Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion in 2014, the unit was initially called the \u201cAzov Battalion,\u201d active around the Mariupol area. Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense encouraged at the time volunteer battalions to help the army and resistance efforts. Later that year, the Azov battalion was \u201creorganized and expanded into the Azov Special Police Regiment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,\u201d before becoming part of the National Guard, according to its website. In 2015, Azov fighters liberated Mariupol and its surroundings from occupation, pushing Russian forces far away from the city. They took part in several major battles in Donetsk region. The battalion has said it repeatedly denies \u201callegations of fascism, nazism and racism,\u201d in response to claims it had associations with White supremacists and neo-Nazi ideology. The US State Department said Tuesday that Russian disinformation \u201chas actively worked to discredit\u201d the unit. \u201cThey have long tried to conflate Ukraine\u2019s National Guard Unit of 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov with a militia formed to defend Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion in 2014, called the \u201cAzov Battalion,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said. \u201cThat militia disbanded in 2015 and the Special Forces Brigade Azov is unrelated to that militia.\u201d After applying the Leahy vetting process, the State Department \u201cfound no evidence of Gross Violations of Human Rights\u201d committed by the 12th Azov Special Forces Brigade. Russian Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said Tuesday the steps taken by Washington \u201ccan cause nothing but extreme indignation.\u201d He called the brigade \u201can openly nationalist formation\u201d and said Moscow is concerned over \u201cUS approaches in the fight against terrorism.\u201d After the bombing of a Mariupol theater in 2022 that was sheltering civilians and had the word \u201cchildren\u201d written in Russian on the ground on either side of the building, the Russian Defense Ministry accused \u201cmilitants of the nationalist \u2018Azov\u2019 battalion\u201d of carrying out the attack. At the time, local\u00a0Ukrainian officials blamed Russia for the attack, which is believed to have killed hundreds who were sheltering in the theater amid heavy bombardment in the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion. The city of Mariupol has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, after Ukrainian soldiers, including members of the Azov unit, and residents sheltered for weeks underground at the city\u2019s massive Azovstal steelworks plant refusing to surrender to Russian forces.

{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_hamas-responds-hostage-deal-intl-latam", "text": "Talks to bring about a ceasefire and hostage deal that could stop the war in Gaza were thrown into doubt when Israel characterized a Hamas response to the latest proposal as a rejection,\u00a0precipitating a blame game between the two sides. Hamas had submitted its response to Qatari mediators, proposing amendments to the Israeli proposal, including a timeline for a permanent ceasefire and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a source with knowledge of the talks told CNN on Tuesday. A diplomatic source familiar with ongoing negotiations, however, told CNN Wednesday that Hamas has neither accepted nor rejected the deal, and that framing the Hamas response as a rejection is misleading. Speaking at a news conference in Doha on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that \u201cHamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table\u201d for a permanent ceasefire and release of the hostages. \u201cSome of the changes are workable. Some are not,\u201d he said, without providing further details. Blinken said he discussed the changes with Egyptian and Qatari partners, but stressed that the proposed deal \u201cwas virtually identical\u201d to a proposal that Hamas previously accepted. \u201cHamas could have answered with a single word \u2013 yes,\u201d he said, adding that as\u00a0Hamas proposed more changes,\u00a0he questioned whether the group is negotiating \u201cin good faith.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for the haggling to stop and a ceasefire to start. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Blinken said. Speaking alongside Blinken, Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said that both Hamas and Israel have on different occasions been \u201ccounterproductive to the efforts.\u201d The Qatari official said that as a mediator, the Gulf state wants to \u201censure that we bridge the gap between those two fundamental differences; between what Hamas wants as a permanent ceasefire, and what Israel wants as a hostage release and maybe a plan to continue the war.\u201d After submitting its response Tuesday,\u00a0Hamas spokesman and political bureau member Osama Hamdan\u00a0told Lebanon-based TV Al Mayadeen, the group was committed to achieving a ceasefire. \u201cOur response is a clear reaffirmation of our commitment to the ceasefire and withdrawal from Gaza, a commitment we have consistently upheld,\u201d Hamdan\u00a0added. But in a potential sign of how Israel views the proposed amendments, one Israeli official described Hamas\u2019 response to the original deal as a rejection. \u201cIsrael received the Hamas answer from the mediators. In its response, Hamas rejected the outline of the deal for the release of the hostages presented by US President (Joe) Biden,\u201d the official told CNN. Other news organizations report the same initial Israeli response. Hamas leadership quickly pushed back on the claim as an attempt to back out of the proposal. \u201cThe response of Hamas and the Palestinian factions to the truce proposal was responsible, serious and positive. The response is consistent with the demands of our people and the resistance and opens the way to reaching an agreement,\u201d said Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, late on Tuesday. \u201cThe Israeli media\u2019s incitement to Hamas\u2019s response is an indication of attempts to evade the agreement\u2019s obligations.\u201d\u00a0 The tensions are surfacing at a sensitive moment. Blinken\u00a0is\u00a0currently on a\u00a0diplomatic swing through the region trying to secure agreement on\u00a0the\u00a0plan first unveiled by President Biden eleven days ago. Blinken was up late into the night on Tuesday in Jordan reviewing Hamas\u2019s response to the latest Israeli proposal on the table that\u00a0his team received in-person from the\u00a0Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, a senior state department official said Wednesday. Blinken, who was in Amman as part of his multi-country trip to the Middle East, sent two senior State Department officials on Tuesday night to meet with Kamel and receive the Hamas response, the official said. Assistant Secretary Barbara Leaf and Counselor Derek Chollet, the officials who met Kamel, then came back to brief Blinken at his hotel, the official said. The official would not characterize the contents of the Hamas response. The plan being negotiated, drafted by Israel, has not been made public in full. Endorsed by the United Nations Security Council on Monday, the plan\u00a0envisages\u00a0a six-week ceasefire - during which Hamas would release hostages and Israel would release Palestinian prisoners \u2013 that would evolve into a permanent cessation of hostilities through negotiations. The White House has been at pains to stress it is an Israeli plan and have repeatedly said that Israel has accepted it, despite objections from Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mixed signals in Israel Earlier Tuesday, Israel had made its clearest signal yet that it was poised to formally sign up to the plan - though in the same short statement it suggested it intended to maintain the freedom to keep fighting. The short Israeli communication, attributed only to an Israeli government official, though widely understood to mean the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, started with an assertion of Israel\u2019s war aims before expressing support for the US-backed proposal currently on the table. \u201cIsrael will not end the war before achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future,\u201d it said. \u201cThe proposal presented enables Israel to achieve these goals and Israel will indeed do so,\u201d the statement concluded. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s oft-repeated promise of total victory and the elimination of Hamas did not get a mention. The Israeli leader is caught between the voices of many in his country, who believe a ceasefire deal is the best way to secure the release of the 120 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, and those of his extreme right coalition partners who are adamant they want the war to continue. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir have both threatened to collapse the government if Netanyahu agrees to the deal in its current form. By contrast, senior opposition figures like one-time war cabinet member Benny Gantz, and opposition leader Yair Lapid have also been among those urging Netanyahu to embrace the US-backed plan. Hamas has also been under pressure to get on board with the US-backed proposal but said last week it is concerned Israel might not go through with the second phase of the plan \u2013 a permanent end to the fighting. \u201cUnless there is a clear position [from Israel] to prepare for a permanent ceasefire and a total withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, which is what could open the door wide to completing the agreement\u2026 we cannot come to an agreement,\u201d Hamas spokesman\u00a0and political bureau member\u00a0Osama Hamdan warned last week.

While protracted military detention has decreased recently, the report\u00a0released Monday\u00a0noted that many women still experienced mistreatment. Titled, \u201c\u2018Help us build our lives\u2019: Girl Survivors of Boko Haram and Military Abuses in Northeast Nigeria,\u201d it probes how girls and young women have been abducted, forced into marriage, and subjected to sexual violence by Boko Haram. Survivors recounted giving birth to children fathered by Boko Haram fighters, often when they were still minors themselves. One young woman revealed that she twice witnessed Boko Haram members execute women who had taken contraceptive pills. Based on 126 interviews with women and girls aged between 12 and 48 years old,\u00a0including 82 who survived being abused while children,\u00a0the report details the atrocities carried out by Boko Haram.\u00a0The interviews were conducted between 2019 and 2024 in northeast Nigeria, with the majority undertaken in the past year. Amnesty\u00a0has contacted several global partners about its findings, including the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, urging it to investigate\u00a0\u201ccrimes under international law committed by all parties during the conflict in north-east Nigeria.\u201d Amnesty\u00a0researchers say they spoke to nearly 50 girls and young women who escaped Boko Haram\u00a0and found their way to government-held territory, risking their lives\u00a0and those of their children\u00a0in the process. However, their horrific experiences at the hands of their captors were further compounded by the hardship they faced once they regained their freedom. \u00a0\u201cThese girls, many of whom are now young women, had their childhood stolen from them and suffered a litany of war crimes and other human rights abuses. They are now showing remarkable bravery as they seek to take control of their future,\u201d said Samira Daoud, Amnesty\u00a0International\u2019s regional director for West and Central Africa. \u2018Wives of Boko Haram\u2019 Among the 126, the Amnesty\u00a0team spoke to 31 girls and young women who described being unlawfully imprisoned in military custody between 2015 and mid-2023 for periods ranging from a few days to over four years, accused of having allegiances with Boko Haram. They described being humiliated by soldiers who called them \u201cwives of Boko Haram\u201d and accused them of being behind killings carried out by the terror group. Several told Amnesty\u00a0researchers of enduring beatings while detained by the military. One of them, named NV in the report, said she fled Boko Haram in 2021 when she was around 20. She said she was held for two months in Madagali, Adamawa State, by soldiers. NV said: \u201cWhen they [soldiers] brought food\u2026 they gave us a portion in our hand and soup in one bowl for all of us to share\u2026 As a toilet, they gave us a plastic bag.\u201d Another, called GN in the report, said Nigerian soldiers detained her after they raided the camp where she and others were held by Boko Haram, before being taken to an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp.\u00a0She had been forcibly married to a Boko Haram fighter while in captivity but remarried while living in the IDP for an extended period. She\u00a0later\u00a0received a call from her Boko Haram \u201chusband\u201d asking her to come back to him, which aroused suspicion from a neighbor who reported her to security forces, GN said. \u201cNigerian soldiers detained her in Bama Prison for around one month in the second half of 2021 and beat her with a cane for three days. She was pregnant at the time. The soldiers blindfolded her and transferred her to Giwa Barracks in Maiduguri. GN was unlawfully detained there for around one year, during which she gave birth,\u201d the report stated. By the time she regained her freedom, her Boko Haram \u201chusband\u201d had sued her and her new husband in sharia (Islamic) court and they were ordered to pay him money, it added. Amnesty\u00a0International said it had communicated its findings to Nigerian federal and state authorities. In response, the Nigerian Defense Headquarters in a statement sent to CNN Monday said the Armed Forces of Nigeria AFN \u201cmakes it unequivocally clear that, it is a professional military force that operates within the ambit of International law of armed conflict.\u201d Adding that it would encourage Amnesty \u201cto approach the military high command to substantiate their allegations. The military has self regulating mechanisms with which it administers the military justice system to address any proven case of misconduct of personnel.\u201d CNN has contacted the\u00a0Nigerian Army and the Borno State authorities for comment on the allegations. The\u00a0Borno State government, under an initiative to reintegrate fleeing and surrendered Boko Haram fighters, gave reassurances that they would not be prosecuted but allowed to stay with their families, including their wives, according to the report. \u201cBorno State Governor Babagana Zulum promised that Boko Haram fighters would not be handed over to the military and would be provided with services and allowed to stay with their families, including their \u2018wives,\u2019\u201d the report said. When Amnesty asked girls and young women about the screening process conducted by the military or government authorities after they had exited Boko Haram, \u201cnone of the interviewees said they were asked whether they had married or joined Boko Haram freely.\u201d This failure to attempt to identify victims of forced marriage or trafficking makes it even harder for the women and girls to access the support they are entitled to, the report said. A decade-long reign of terror Since 2009, the armed Islamist group\u00a0Boko Haram\u00a0has waged an insurgency estimated to have killed more than 35,000 people and displaced two million people in the country\u2019s northeast, according to the UN. During a reign of terror that spanned more than a decade, Boko Haram launched attacks on families in the northeast of Nigeria, with tactics including\u00a0\u201csuicide bombings, abductions, torture, rape, forced marriages, and recruitment of child soldiers,\u201d according to the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. One of Boko Haram\u2019s most notorious abductions was the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls in 2014, when nearly 300 students were taken from their school in Chibok, Borno State. This event prompted global outrage and spotlighted the insurgent group\u2019s brutal tactics. Since the Chibok abductions, many more girls have been abducted; most of them were forced into marriage. According to the report, Boko Haram engages in child and forced marriage. The interviewees described harsh treatment and public punishments and at least 31 girls told Amnesty\u00a0researchers they were forced to witness lashings, amputations, and beheadings. One girl referred to as GH in the report, was held captive for about 10 years. She recounted often being forced to watch violent punishments.\u00a0\u201cSometimes I dream about the corpses that I saw or the stoning of the women that I saw. Once I open my eyes, I can\u2019t go back to sleep again,\u201d she\u00a0said in the report. Many\u00a0survivors of Boko Haram\u00a0told Amnesty\u00a0that they witnessed Boko Haram killing their relatives. One\u00a0young woman, named as\u00a0CB\u00a0in the report,\u00a0said she was abducted at around\u00a0age\u00a013 in 2014. \u201cOne day, Boko Haram \u2026 came into our house. They told our father we were non-believers. They shot my father in the back of his head, and the bullet came through his eyes. We started crying. They said if we\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0keep quiet, they\u00a0will\u00a0kill my mother too,\u201d she told researchers. Kidnapped girls were also forced into sexual slavery and domestic servitude as \u201cwives,\u201d with at least 33 survivors telling Amnesty\u00a0they were raped by the men they were forced to marry. One teenager, named as HA in the Amnesty\u00a0report, said she agreed\u00a0to get married to a Boko Haram militant to save her father\u2019s life. She added that she was frequently raped and beaten\u00a0during the \u201cmarriage,\u201d with other Boko Haram fighters helping her husband as he forced himself on her. Consequently, many of the girls and young women face long-term issues relating to their health,\u00a0have had\u00a0limited access to education, and\u00a0suffer\u00a0stigma from their loved ones and their community. Amnesty\u00a0says the women and girls are speaking out to seek urgent help and support. \u201cThese survivors are overlooked and abandoned. This needs to change \u2026 on their terms and with their active and meaningful participation. Their message must no longer be ignored: \u201cHelp us rebuild our lives.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/africa/boko-haram-nigerian-girls-neglected-amnesty-says-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

WAFA\u2019s report did not give any details about whether there were any casualties. The Israeli military denied carrying out any strikes on the safe zone or surrounding areas. \u201cContrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces told CNN. The latest report of a strike come as a ceasefire plan for the devastating eight-month war between Israel and Hamas stutters, with neither side yet publicly committing to the deal despite intense lobbying from American officials, including US President Joe Biden. Hamas said\u00a0in a statement\u00a0Wednesday it \u201chas shown the necessary positivity in all stages of negotiations\u201d\u00a0to reach a \u201ccomprehensive and acceptable agreement based on the just demands of our people.\u201d The statement comes after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioned whether the Palestinian militant group is \u201cproceeding in good faith\u201d in the ceasefire negotiations, saying Hamas had proposed a number of changes in their response to the latest deal, which \u201cgo beyond positions they had previously taken.\u201d On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Rafah said it had received information from Israeli authorities that fighting will continue in western Rafah. CNN video showed many Palestinians taking down shelters and packing up their belongings after warnings spread of a pending military operation. An estimated 550,000 people are now in Al-Mawasi, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from Oxfam, after the IDF ordered people in eastern Rafah to head to the \u201cexpanded humanitarian area\u201d as it stepped up its operations in southern Gaza. Currently just 121 toilets have been installed in the densely packed tent city, according to Oxfam, meaning every toilet is shared by more than 4,000 people. The Al-Mawasi camp was already filled with displaced people before civilians in Rafah were ordered to move there. The United Nations has called facilities in the area unsuitable for the hundreds of thousands of Gazans uprooted by violence in Rafah and across the Gaza Strip. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah to the nearby areas of Al-Mawasi, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis in recent weeks, according to Oxfam. Some 1.7 million people, more than two thirds of Gaza\u2019s population, are now estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers (27 square miles) \u2014 less than a fifth of the strip. The reports of strikes on Thursday follow an operation by Israel to rescue hostages held by Hamas over the weekend. The Israeli military rescued four hostages in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, an operation that Gazan authorities said killed 274 people and injured almost 700 others. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures.

The Russian \u201cfrigate Gorshkov, the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, the fleet oil tanker Pashin, and the rescue tug Nikolai Chiker\u201d will visit the port of Havana between June 12 and 17, according to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces in a statement published by the Foreign Ministry. Cuba says none of the ships carry nuclear weapons and insists their stopover does not represent a threat to the region. \u201cVisits by naval units from other countries are a historical practice of the revolutionary government with nations that maintain relations of friendship and collaboration,\u201d the statement added. Moscow has not confirmed the information provided by Cuba. CNN has reached out to the Russian government for comment. It\u2019s not the first time Russian Navy ships have been sent to Cuba, a key ally to the former Soviet Union during the Cold War that briefly hosted nuclear missiles at Moscow\u2019s behest during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Last July, the Russian Navy\u2019s training class ship Perekop sailed into Havana for a four-day visit. The latest visit appears to be the largest of its kind in years. Cuba is increasingly reliant on Russian oil and aid as the communist-run country weathers its worst economic crisis in decades. Cuba\u2019s announcement comes days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes inside Russian territory with American munitions. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Western countries \u201csupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing.\u201d \u201cIn the end, if we see that these countries become involved in a war against us, what they are doing makes them directly involved in a war against the Russian Federation, we reserve the right to act the same way,\u201d Putin said on Wednesday. Putin added that as a response, \u201cwe will improve our air defense systems to destroy the missiles.\u201d He also asked why Russia would \u201cnot have the right to supply our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where there will be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against Russia?\u201d \u2018No direct threat\u2019 Russia\u2019s military is expected to increase its naval and air activity near the United States this summer as part of routine maneuvers in the lead up to a global naval exercise in the fall, according to the US State Department and the Pentagon. \u201cRussia is likely to send combat naval vessels to the Caribbean, with potential port calls in Cuba and possibly Venezuela,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Charlie Dietz said on Thursday. \u201cAircraft deployments or flights in the region are also anticipated. These deployments are part of Russia\u2019s routine naval operations and pose no direct threat to the United States.\u201d Alongside Russian ships this summer will also be one of the Russian Navy\u2019s Severodvinsk II-class submarines, Dietz said. The port call for that submarine was approved \u201cat least in part due to Havana\u2019s displeasure\u201d over the visit of a US nuclear submarine to the US\u2019 Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba last year, he said. Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020, Dietz said, adding that the exercises \u201cimpose a significant cost on the Russian Navy, which faces challenges in maintaining readiness and conducting deployments with an aging fleet.\u201d \u201cGiven Russia\u2019s long history of Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises,\u201d Dietz said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/americas/cuba-russian-ships-submarine-visit-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_weather_el-nino-la-nina-summer-forecast-climate", "text": "El Ni\u00f1o has officially come to an end and the ripples from its demise will shake up weather around the globe. El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean \u2013 has gripped the planet since the start of last summer. It reached super status earlier this year after boosting temperatures during the hottest year on record and influencing other global weather events. With El Ni\u00f1o out of the spotlight, its opposite is preparing to take center stage later this summer: La Ni\u00f1a. For now, neither La Ni\u00f1a nor El Ni\u00f1o are present and a so-called neutral phase has begun, according to NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center. But this will change quickly as La Ni\u00f1a builds through the summer and is likely firmly in control by September during the peak of hurricane season. Here\u2019s what a summer without El Ni\u00f1o and a budding La Ni\u00f1a could have in store. Sweltering summer, active Atlantic La Ni\u00f1a summers following strong El Ni\u00f1o winters have historically been some of the hottest on record in the US. This summer\u00a0could be no different, even before La Ni\u00f1a is entrenched. Above-average temperatures are expected over nearly all of the Lower 48 this summer. Sizzling conditions began early in the West and a push of July-like heat is spreading over the eastern half of the country. The transition to La Ni\u00f1a isn\u2019t the only factor influencing temperatures during the hottest time of the year. They are always on the rise in a world warming\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. Along with more intense heat, seasonal forecasts show a concerning precipitation trend for a large portion of the western half of the US. Drier than normal conditions are expected for most West states and parts of the Plains. Dryness and heat are cyclical. The hotter an area becomes, the more it dries out, which could be a recipe for new or worsening drought. A dry area will then get even hotter as most of the sun\u2019s energy goes into heating the ground, with little energy lost to evaporation of wet soil. The loss of El Ni\u00f1o will also have major ramifications in the Atlantic Ocean and is one major reason experts are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season. El Ni\u00f1o tends to create hostile upper level winds that rip storms apart while La Ni\u00f1a does the opposite. So, more storms could develop this year without El Ni\u00f1o holding them back. El Ni\u00f1o also won\u2019t be around to\u00a0curve many storms away\u00a0from the US, potentially leaving the coasts vulnerable this season. The Atlantic Ocean\u2019s record-breaking water temperatures could also act like food for storms, helping them to form, strengthen and survive. The Atlantic is also not the only ocean that\u2019s steamy. Over the past year, El Ni\u00f1o helped drive global average ocean temperatures to record-breaking levels. La Ni\u00f1a may eventually have somewhat of a cooling effect on the world\u2019s oceans, potentially leveling off some of the out-of-control heating of the past year. But that\u2019s not happening anytime soon. Oceans are incredibly slow to cool, especially since about 90% of the world\u2019s excess heat produced by burning planet-heating fossil fuels are stored in them. El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s lasting impact El Ni\u00f1o arrived in June of 2023 and eventually became one of the strongest on record. It influenced the world during its year-long lifetime. Most notably, El Ni\u00f1o helped push both air and ocean temperatures to record levels globally. Every month from June 2023 to May 2024 was the world\u2019s hottest such month on record, CNN previously reported. Global ocean temperatures first climbed to record breaking levels in March 2023 and have remained at historic levels since then. Despite records starting before El Ni\u00f1o arrived on the scene, the toasty climate pattern only exacerbated the situation as record heat in the air seeped into the oceans. The natural climate pattern also influenced many significant weather events since last summer. El Ni\u00f1o likely had a hand in hot and dry conditions in northern South America that brought the Amazon River to record-low levels in October, the US Lower 48\u2019s hottest ever winter and severe drought\u00a0in large portions of central and southern Africa this winter. Parts of Africa\u2019s east coast typically record more rain during El Ni\u00f1o events, but excessive rainfall unfolded to devastating, deadly effect in Kenya in April and May. California and the western US also typically pick up more rain during El Ni\u00f1o, especially over the winter months. That played out this past winter when multiple powerful atmospheric river events slammed the West Coast. Further research is needed to determine El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s full impact over the last 12 months, but these events are proof of the highly influential pattern\u2019s reach.

{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_sinwar-hamas-israel-ceasefire-hostage-talks-intl", "text": "The military leader of Hamas has said he believes he has gained the upper hand over Israel and that the spiralling civilian death toll in Gaza would work in the militant group\u2019s favor, according to a\u00a0report by the Wall Street Journal, citing leaked messages the newspaper\u00a0said it had seen. \u201cWe have the Israelis right where we want them,\u201d Yahya Sinwar told\u00a0other\u00a0Hamas leaders\u00a0recently, according to one of the messages, the WSJ reported Monday. In another, Sinwar is said to have described civilian deaths as \u201cnecessary sacrifices\u201d while citing past independence-related conflicts in countries like Algeria. The WSJ said it reviewed dozens of messages sent to ceasefire negotiators from Sinwar, who has not been seen in public since Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel left 1,200 people dead and another 250 taken hostage. The ensuing Israeli assault aimed at eliminating the group has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians in the strip, according to health authorities there. Sinwar\u2019s whereabouts are unknown but he is assumed to be hiding deep underground in Hamas\u2019 labyrinthine tunnel system below Gaza. The messages reported by the WSJ offer a rare glimpse into the mind of the man steering Hamas\u2019 thinking on the war and suggest an uncompromising determination to continue fighting, regardless of the human cost. In another exchange that took place as Israel\u00a0set a deadline\u00a0in February to enter Rafah before the Muslim month of Ramadan, the WSJ reported that Sinwar urged Hamas\u2019 political leaders not to make concessions and instead push for a permanent end to the war,\u00a0adding that high civilian casualties would ramp up global pressure on Israel to halt the conflict. \u201cIsrael\u2019s journey in Rafah won\u2019t be a walk in the park,\u201d Sinwar allegedly said in a message to the Hamas political leadership. CNN has not seen the leaked messages viewed by the WSJ and is not able to confirm the authenticity of the communications. Commenting on the WSJ report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on X: \u201cSinwar\u00a0profits off the deaths of Gazan civilians, calling them \u201cnecessary sacrifices\u201d in order to urge international pressure on Israel\u2019s efforts to eliminate his terrorist organization.\u201d Mediators are waiting for a Hamas response to an\u00a0Israeli proposal presented\u00a0by US President Joe Biden last month, which aims to release the hostages in Gaza and implement a lasting ceasefire there. \u2018Waiting on\u2019 Sinwar Sinwar\u2019s alleged comments emerged as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on another tour through the Middle East to push all sides to agree to the latest proposal. Speaking from Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Blinken made it clear that the US believes Sinwar is the ultimate decision-maker. \u201cI think there are there those who have influenced, but influence is one thing, actually getting a decision made is the is another thing. I don\u2019t think anyone other than the Hamas leadership in Gaza actually are the ones who can make decisions,\u201d Blinken said, adding that \u201cthat is what we are waiting on.\u201d Blinken said that Hamas\u2019 answer to the proposal will reveal the group\u2019s priorities. \u201cWe await the answer from Hamas in and that will speak volumes about what they want, what they\u2019re looking for, who they\u2019re looking after,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cAre they looking after one guy who may be for now safe \u2026 I don\u2019t know, 10 stories underground somewhere in Gaza, while the people that he purports to represent continue to suffer in a crossfire of his own making? Or will he do what\u2019s necessary to actually move this to a better place, to help end the suffering of people to help bring real security to Israelis and Palestinians alike.\u201d In early messages to ceasefire negotiators, Sinwar seemed \u201csurprised\u201d by the brutality of the October 7 attack on Israel. \u201cThings went out of control,\u201d Sinwar said in one of his messages, according to the WSJ, adding he was \u201creferring to gangs taking civilian women and children as hostages.\u201d \u201cPeople got caught up in this, and that should not have happened,\u201d Sinwar said, according to the WSJ. The US-designated terrorist had also expressed discontent after not being consulted for a meeting between the Hamas political leaders with other Palestinian factions, calling the meeting \u201cshameful and outrageous.\u201d \u201cAs long as fighters are still standing and we have not lost the war, such contacts should be immediately terminated,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe have the capabilities to continue fighting for months.\u201d He had also compared the war in Gaza to a 7th-century battle in Karbala, Iraq, a monumental moment in Islamic history where the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed was killed. \u201cWe have to move forward on the same path we started,\u201d Sinwar reportedly wrote. \u201cOr let it be a new Karbala.\u201d On Monday,\u00a014 of the 15 United Nations Security Council\u00a0members voted in favor of a US-drafted resolution around the latest ceasefire proposal, with only Russia abstaining \u2013 the first time the council has endorsed such a plan to end the war. Israel is not a member of the UNSC, and so did not vote. The comprehensive three-stage peace deal, which sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces, was first laid out publicly by US President Biden on May 31. The landmark vote means the UNSC now joins other major global bodies in backing the plan, increasing international pressure on both Hamas and Israel to end the conflict. Hamas welcomed the adoption of the UNSC resolution, saying in a statement it was ready to engage with mediators to implement measures such as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, prisoner exchange, returning residents to their homes and the \u201crejection of any demographic change or reduction in the area of the Gaza Strip.\u201d The resolution says Israel has accepted the plan, and US officials have repeatedly emphasized Israel had agreed to the proposal \u2013 despite other public comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that suggest otherwise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/sinwar-hamas-israel-ceasefire-hostage-talks-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft", "text": "Microsoft and Google will offer free or discounted cybersecurity services to rural hospitals across the United States to make them less vulnerable to cyberattacks that have disrupted patient care and threatened lives, the White House and those tech firms said Monday. Microsoft said in a statement to CNN that it would provide free security updates for eligible rural hospitals, as well as security assessments and training for hospital staff. Google will provide free cybersecurity advice to rural hospitals and start a pilot program to match the firm\u2019s cybersecurity services with the needs of rural hospitals. The nation\u2019s roughly 1,800 rural community hospitals are among the most vulnerable to dangerous ransomware attacks because they often lack IT security resources and cybersecurity-trained staff. And they may be the only hospitals within dozens of miles, meaning a ransomware attack that prevents a hospital from accepting ambulances can put patients\u2019 lives at risk. The new announcement is\u00a0the result of private discussions between the tech firms and officials at the White House National Security Council who have growing increasingly concerned about cyber threats to hospitals. It\u2019s an effort to use the broad reach of Microsoft and Google\u2019s software, which is used in hospitals across the United States, to help plug a gap in the defense of the health care sector. \u201cWe\u2019re in new territory as we see \u2026 this wave of attacks against hospitals,\u201d Anne Neuberger, the top cyber official at the White House National Security Council, told reporters on Sunday. The Biden administration is also preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would impose penalties on the victims of cyberattacks after they are hacked. A growing problem The number of ransomware attacks against the US healthcare sector increased by 128% in 2023 compared to 2022,\u00a0according to data\u00a0released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. And recent ransomware attacks have brought the sector\u2019s vulnerability into sharp relief. A February ransomware attack on a major health insurance billing firm\u00a0cut off health providers\u00a0from billions of dollars and put some health clinics on the brink of bankruptcy. UnitedHealth Group, whose subsidiary was hacked, paid a $22 million ransom to the hackers to try to recover patient data. One third of Americans may have had their data stolen. Another ransomware attack, in May, on one of America\u2019s largest hospital chains,\u00a0put patients\u2019 lives in danger\u00a0as nurses were forced to manually enter prescription information, multiple nurses at affected hospitals told CNN. The FBI and its international allies have conducted a series of crackdowns on ransomware gangs, seizing the computers they use and unlocking some of the victim computers that hackers have encrypted. But ransomware remains a flourishing business, in part, US officials say, because many of its perpetrators operate with impunity from Russia. The health care sector is a particularly enticing target because hospitals under duress to restore patient services\u00a0are sometimes willing\u00a0to pay the ransom. \u201cWe do see a much more permissive environment in Russia by both hacktivists and criminals, and it\u2019s of concern,\u201d Neuberger, the White House official, told reporters. \u201cWe also see more and more companies paying ransoms. And every ransom payment feeds the beast and drives further attacks.\u201d Cleveland cyberattack shuts City Hall Cyberattacks have frequently shut down other vulnerable services. The\u00a0City of Cleveland is\u00a0investigating a cyber incident, according to a statement from mayor Justin\u00a0Bibb. As a precaution, the city said it closed City Hall Monday, and it will keep City Hall closed Tuesday. Cleveland also shut down all of its internal systems and software. But city and emergency services like the Department of Public Safety, 911, police, the fire department, ambulances and the Department of Public Utilities, will remain operational, Bibb\u2019s office said. However, the mayor said the emergency services are functioning with limited IT capabilities. \u201cOver the weekend, the city identified some abnormalities,\u201d Commissioner Kimberly\u00a0Roy-Wilson, with the city\u2019s Division of Information Technology Services, said. \u201cWe have moved into our protocols and procedures with regards to containment and we are now investigating the nature and scope of those abnormalities.\u201d Bibb would not say how many or which agencies are helping with the investigation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_weather_florida-flooding-storm-forecast-thursday", "text": "Heavy rainfall has been inundating South Florida for a third day in a row on Thursday, with flash flood warnings in effect from Miami to Fort Lauderdale, after Wednesday\u2019s storms transformed roads into canals and caused water to seep into homes. Flash flooding is likely to occur at a faster rate than usual as the areas around Miami are already saturated from more than a foot of rain in the past two days. Nearly 1.7 million people living in South Florida \u2013 including the cities of Hialeah, Aventura and Doral \u2013 are under a flash flood warning Thursday evening as a line of storms approach the Miami area and bring the potential to produce several inches of rain in a short period of time, according to the Miami-South Florida office of the\u00a0National Weather Service. \u201cSignificant flash flooding (is) expected over urban areas, (with) locally catastrophic flash flooding possible,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center warned earlier Thursday. High risk days are exceedingly rare \u2014 happening on fewer than 4% of days each year on average \u2014 but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the US. More than 8 million people are under flood alerts Thursday, including Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Naples. Another 4 to 8 inches of widespread rain is expected through Friday, but it\u2019s possible some spots record nearly a foot of rain. Six to more than 20 inches of rain has deluged South Florida since Tuesday morning, prompting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a state of emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties. While the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. Ongoing flooding resulting from past rainfall is one of the main reasons the flood risk is so high Thursday. Floodwaters haven\u2019t had time to fully recede and some communities in and north of the Miami metro remained underwater Thursday morning, aerial imagery showed. That was the case in Hallandale Beach \u2013 located just north of Miami \u2013 where nearly 20 inches of rain had fallen, and some mobile home parks were still underwater, said Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Michael Kane. Severe flooding there on Wednesday covered cars up to their windshields, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety. Others had to be rescued. \u201cWe had to use our boats to rescue people standing on top of the roofs of cars,\u201d Kane told CNN. Kane\u2019s office received 175 calls for help in Hallandale Beach alone. Resident Kait Madrigal spent five hours stuck in her car Wednesday after it became suddenly surrounded by floodwaters on her way to work near Hollywood, Florida, she told CNN. She was able to park on the sidewalk to get to higher ground but began to panic as the water rose and cars began to stall out around her. \u201cIf I was to open my car door, I would\u2019ve just had a ton of water rushing in. I would\u2019ve been out of luck big time,\u201d the 25-year-old said. After hours of unrelenting rain, Madrigal waded through the water and was able to find a possible exit route. Fearing she may become trapped all night, she drove out and was able to get home safely, she said. Several local officials have warned against trying to drive through murky floodwaters and are urging storm-weary South Floridians to stay home. Most flood-related drownings occur when cars unknowingly drive into deep water, the Florida Department of Highway Safety said. Fort Lauderdale, where the mayor declared a local state of emergency, received its entire average June rainfall of around 9.5 inches in just 24 hours Wednesday. Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport led the nation with the most flights canceled or delayed Wednesday, with more than 1,200 disruptions. The air travel woes are expected to continue through the end of the workweek. In Broward County, the severe storms prompted school officials to postpone the demolition of the Marjory\u00a0Stoneman\u00a0Douglas High School building where a gunman killed\u00a017 people in 2018. Many South Florida residents had only just finished repairing their homes after catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps Wednesday. Anna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home. \u201cI put the dogs in, I\u2019m all packed up. I pretty much got everything in bins and we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph told CNN affiliate WSVN Wednesday. \u201cMy husband\u2019s like \u2018Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic,\u2019 but you know, I\u2019m not gonna be caught unprepared.\u201d Significant flood risk Thursday Multiple rounds of torrential downpours fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean are drenching the southern Florida Peninsula on Thursday. Friday will also be another drenching day for South Florida, even as the robust tropical moisture fueling the soaking storms slowly starts to shift out of the area. All told, multiple locations could end up with more than two feet of rain Tuesday through Friday. Wet weather is likely to continue over the weekend, just not to the severity of the past several days. But even the light-to-moderate rainfall rates of typical June showers and thunderstorms could cause additional flooding issues and prevent ongoing flooding from receding. If there\u2019s any silver lining, it\u2019s the rain is beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull\u2019s-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the\u00a0US Drought Monitor.

{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl", "text": "Tesla is one step closer to launching full-self driving (FSD) technology in China after it clinched an agreement with Baidu to upgrade its mapping software. The Chinese tech giant said Saturday that it was providing lane-level navigation services for Tesla cars. Baidu (BIDU) says this level of navigation can provide drivers with detailed information, including making lane recommendations ahead of upcoming turns, to enhance safety. Experts said during Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk\u2019s surprise visit to China at the end of April that one of his main hurdles in securing government approval to rollout the company\u2019s FSD software was reaching a mapping and navigation deal with Baidu. \u201cWith the support of Baidu\u2019s lane-level map, Tesla\u2019s navigation can accurately render lane changes on the road the user is currently on, upgrading from providing road-level guidance to providing lane-level guidance,\u201d Baidu said in the statement. China\u2019s answer to Google has been been providing mapping services to Tesla since 2020. But prior to Saturday\u2019s announcement, its services had been limited to \u201croad-level\u201d information, which is less precise than lane-level navigation. A day earlier, Tesla launched its new software upgrade for users in urban areas in China, the world\u2019s biggest car market, saying in a statement on WeChat that such detailed road information was being made available \u201cfor the first time.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment. On Monday, Baidu declined further comment. Virtually all Teslas have a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, while the more robust FSD feature comes at a premium price. Autopilot is available in China, but not the full FSD feature. Teaming up with Baidu would remove an obstacle, as the Chinese firm has key mapping credentials that can be applied to driver-assistance functions. According to Chinese regulations, all self-driving systems must obtain mapping qualifications before operating on public roads. Foreign car companies need to partner with licensed Chinese companies to qualify for surveying and mapping. Partnering with Baidu would allow Tesla to run its full self-driving system on China\u2019s public roads, with its vehicles able to collect surrounding data, such as road layout, traffic signs and buildings. It could also accelerate Tesla\u2019s global development of its self-driving technology, as data from China could be used to train Tesla\u2019s algorithms needed for fully autonomous vehicles. Car owners have long complained on social media about Tesla\u2019s previous navigation services, which were also provided by Baidu, saying they often have to rely on other maps available on smartphones while driving. \u201cThis time, you can really remove your mobile phone holders (mounted in the car),\u201d Tesla said in its Friday announcement, suggesting drivers no longer need other maps for navigation. The news went viral on Chinese social media on Monday. \u201cAfter the system upgrade, I no longer need to use my mobile phone to navigate,\u201d said one Weibo user. \u201cTesla\u2019s (own) navigation system can finally be used.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u201d Introducing the FSD system could provide a revenue boost to Tesla, which is having a tough time in China. In April, it slashed prices across its car product lines in the country, hoping to bolster sales in the face of slowing demand and increased competition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\u00a0plundered the facility on Saturday stealing an ambulance among other supplies, the aid agency said. \u201cOn Saturday, MSF and the Ministry of Health suspended all activities in South Hospital, El Fasher, North Darfur, after RSF soldiers stormed the facility, opened fire, and looted it, including stealing an MSF ambulance,\u201d MSF Sudan said on social media Saturday. The hospital was the only one in the region \u201cequipped to deal with mass casualties\u201d and \u201cwas the main referral hospital for treating war-wounded.\u201d It was also one of the two hospitals in El Fasher with surgical capacity, according to MSF. As a result, patients are being moved to Paediatric and Saudi hospitals \u201cwhich were unprepared for such an influx,\u201d it added. Video posted on an apparent RSF \u201cX\u201d account shows armed men at the front gate of South Hospital. The footage was geolocated by CNN and shows at least one man firing an AK-style weapon on hospital grounds. According to MSF\u2019s statement posted on Twitter,\u00a0only ten patients and a small medical team were at the hospital\u00a0when it was attacked. Medical teams had already begun transferring patients and services to other facilities earlier in the week after intensified fighting in the region, the MSF said. Images posted to social media and verified by CNN show damaged medical equipment strewn in and around the facility. In one video, an armed man poses inside what appears to be an ambulance parked outside South Hospital. It is unclear whether the vehicle belonged to MSF. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment. MSF said most patients and the remaining medical team, which included all MSF staff, were able to flee the violence but they are unable to say for certain if there were any casualties due to the chaos that ensued. South Hospital is the latest medical facility to fall into warring factions\u2019 crosshairs in Darfur. The medical facility had already been hit by mortar shells and bullets multiple times in the preceding weeks between May 25th\u00a0and June 3rd\u00a0resulting in two deaths and 14 injuries among patients and caretakers, according to MSF. On May 11, nearby Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital was impacted by an SAF airstrike 50 meters from the facility, per an MSF press release. Two children and a care giver in the intensive care unit were killed in the strike after a roof collapsed. \u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\u201d said MSF\u2019s Head of Emergencies Michel Lacharite, as quoted by MSF Sudan on X Saturday. \u201cWarring parties must halt attacks on medical care. Hospitals are closing. Remaining facilities can\u2019t handle mass casualties. We are trying to find solutions.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_style_digital-dermatology-rise", "text": "Not so long ago, seeing a dermatologist was only deemed necessary if you had skin problems or possessed a famous face to be pored over in magazines or on the big screen. Not anymore. Whether it\u2019s due to the rise of social media or celebrity culture, the past decade has seen our quest for apparently flawless skin go up a gear. A recent study found Gen Z spend more cash\u202fon their skin than any other age group (and more than previous generations). And in 2023 alone, spending on skincare by tweens and teens \u202fleapt 20%. Technology has also made getting expert advice increasingly achievable, too. Online dermatology developed quickly during the pandemic when Covid-19 restrictions meant that over 90% of dermatologists were using \u201cteledermatology\u201d (e.g. video calls and digital images to discuss skin concerns remotely) compared to 14.1% pre-Covid, said the American Academy of Dermatology. The advent of digital dermatology, pushed forward by increasingly innovative and sophisticated digital tools \u2014\u00a0not only smartphones and video calling apps but artificial intelligence \u2014 is enabling a growing number of global brands to diagnose, prescribe and produce bespoke creams via virtual consultation rooms. It\u2019s dermatology without the wait list, minus the travel and, somewhat ironically, without the need for a face-to-face interaction. But is it any good? \u201cThe pandemic clearly accelerated the popularity of digital dermatology and (it) is rapidly advancing, encompassing not only teledermatology but also consumer tech, machine learning, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence,\u201d said Shoshana Marmon, Assistant Professor of Dermatology at New York Medical College. \u201cThe increased sophistication of remote offerings is a natural progression.\u201d I have never visited a dermatologist before (digitally or otherwise) or used a prescription cream, but aged 43, I am beginning to notice fine lines, large pores and signs of sun damage that require something stronger than my typical drugstore go-tos. I tried Klira, a digital dermatology service co-founded in 2021 by British dermatologist Dr. Emma Craythorne. After filling an online questionnaire about my medical history and lifestyle, I answered dozens of detailed questions about my face, sharing everything from my pore size and levels of sun exposure to shininess. This information is analyzed by Klira\u2019s in-house team of consultant dermatologists who review the questionnaire along with photos of my make-up free face. Within 24 hours, the results are back. I am a \u201cSkinSize 04,\u201d one of 12 skin categories defined by Dr. Craythorne to reflects how skin looks, feels and ages. Essentially, it means that while I have a tendency towards blocked follicles due to excess sebum, my skin is otherwise easy to manage, as long as I remember my SPF (and I haven\u2019t over the years). I am prescribed a bespoke \u201cKlira Solution\u201d to tackle \u201caccumulative UV exposure,\u201d which will be delivered straight to my door within seven days. It\u2019s for use at night and contains the chemical exfoliant tretinoin (only available on prescription) and the anti-inflammatory azelaic acid. The formula should enhance collagen production, strengthen skin barrier and even out skin tone. Support is attained via an online \u201cpersonal portal,\u201d which features instructions clinical notes, instructions on how to use the cream, plus recommendations for complimentary products to cleanse, moisturize and protect. There is a one and three-month check in via email, but you can contact the team online whenever you have questions. While the monthly subscription can be cancelled anytime on the \u00a365 flexible membership ($82), the idea is you continue until your skin goals have been reached and ideally beyond that to maintain results. Speedy, simple but not the same Although, changes to my skin might require patience (at least six weeks to see an increased \u201cglow\u201d), the speed and simplicity of the digital process itself is undoubtedly impressive. \u201cThese days, we want answers to our skin concerns fast and by using an online dermatology service, I got fantastic knowledge and experience without having to leave the house or be placed on a waiting list,\u201d said Claire Todd, 35, from Cleethorpes, England who turned to Klira to treat pigmentation. \u201cI was dubious at first as I\u2019ve used creams in the past to no avail, but after eight weeks, I could see there was a difference and at 12 weeks, (my patches of pigmentation) had almost completely gone.\u201d In Los Angeles, Emily Thompson, also 35, used an AI-powered skin technology created by Dr Simon Ourian \u2014 dermatologist to the likes of Kim Kardashian and Megan Fox \u2014 to rejuvenate her skin. An uploaded photo is analyzed by AI \u2014 alongside a detailed questionnaire about your lifestyle and skin concerns \u2014 before an avatar of Dr Simon prescribes personalized products known as the \u201c3 Daily Essentials\u201d (cleanser, toner moisturizer). \u201cI\u2019d read about Dr. Simon Ourian, so when I learned about his AI-powered skin analysis, I wanted to give it try.\u202fMy life is busy and finding time for in-person specialist appointments was always a challenge,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThis analysis doesn\u2019t replace in-person visits for serious skin concerns,\u202fbut it worked for what I needed \u2014 my skin to feel hydrated, smoother and more radiant. I love\u202fthat I get to do this\u202ffrom home.\u201d While digital dermatology makes it possible to access the expertise of people who might otherwise be out of your price bracket or zip code, there are inevitable drawbacks and limitations to using a digital dermatologist exclusively. \u201cWhile it can offer many benefits, there are situations where in-person consultations are essential, particularly for complex or serious skin conditions requiring physical examination, biopsy or blood tests,\u201d says Dr\u202fIfeoma\u202fEjikeme, Medical Director and Founder of Adonia Medical Clinic in London. It is why Bryony Firth-Bernard, 28, from Gloucestershire, England decided to see a dermatologist in real life to get some help with her severe acne. \u201cI decided to see a dermatologist face-to-face because I\u2019d tried using an online service and there was no change in my skin. Seeing someone was the best money I\u2019ve ever spent. I was put on Roaccutane, which requires blood tests and is not something to be taken lightly, but it was transformative,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cI understand why people would choose a digi dermatologist, acne crushes your confidence, and you\u2019ll do anything to fix it, and it works for some people, but what I needed could only be prescribed by someone in person.\u201d Even if you do not require in-person treatment, the absence of human contact might not be for everyone. Christal Alert, 29, founder and CEO of Tonal Cosmetics based in New York used online dermatology service Apostrophe to treat severe acne and hyperpigmentation and has mixed feelings about the experience. \u201cAlthough it was not a total transformation, my skin did get a bit better and I would recommend the digital dermatologist route,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy and hassle-free but I felt direct communication with the dermatologist on a virtual call to discuss treatment options in more detail would have enhanced the experience. As with any treatment, it may require further trial and error to find the perfect solution.\u201d If you do decide to dip your toe, be sure to do your homework. \u201cLook at the platform\u2019s reputation and track record in delivering accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations. Ask who the provider is, and whether they have the correct credentials and training to give skin or skincare recommendations,\u201d advised Dr Ejikeme. \u201cCheck how the platforms ensures privacy and data security, and check what the process is for follow-up consultations and referrals when more help is needed.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/style/digital-dermatology-rise/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Daily high temperatures will surge up to 15 degrees above what\u2019s typical for June through at least Saturday and threaten dozens of daily high temperature records as sweltering heat in place over the West expands east. And the heat isn\u2019t dropping by for a quick visit, even if it ebbs in some places. There are signs it\u2019ll stick around for the long haul as a predicted hot summer kicks into gear. Parts of the West have been baking since a stifling heat dome set up over the region last week. One person died on Monday while hiking in Colorado National Monument Park in western Colorado, according to a news release from the National Park Service. Temperatures were around 90 degrees. Now, some of that heat and an additional push of hot air from Mexico are enveloping more of the US as the jet stream \u2013 a river of fast-moving air in the upper atmosphere that separates warm air from cold air \u2013\u00a0slowly shifts north over the central and eastern states. Heat will ramp up Thursday from the Plains to the East Coast, marking a considerable change from seasonably cool conditions earlier in the week. Highs in the upper 80s and 90s will be common from the Plains and Midwest to the Southeast, Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic. Several cities will experience the warmest day of the year so far Thursday, but temperatures will be short of record levels. Humidity will build alongside the heat and make conditions feel even more uncomfortable. The thermometer has yet to climb out of the low 90s in St. Louis this year, but that will change Thursday with a high around 96 degrees. The heat index \u2013 how air feels to the human body \u2013 could approach triple digits. Temperatures will warm even more Friday for much of the Gulf Coast, Southeast and mid-Atlantic as hot air surges north. Highs well into the 90s will stretch from Texas through Georgia and the Carolinas north into parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Friday will be the hottest day of the year so far in Washington, DC. The high temperature could approach the mid-90s, which is about 10 degrees higher than normal. Heat will be at its worst by Saturday for much of the Gulf Coast and Southeast but ease slightly for areas farther north with the passage of a cold front. Atlanta is expected to top out near 99 degrees on Saturday, which would be a temperature record for the date and the hottest reading of the year so far. If the city were to hit 100 degrees it would be the first triple-digit temperature there since August 2019. Highs in the upper 90s and low 100s could also break Saturday\u2019s high temperature records in multiple other Southeast cities including: Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Expansive heat will build once again for much of the central and eastern US on Sunday as the jet stream settles near the US-Canada border and high pressure builds in the upper atmosphere. Anyone hoping for relief is out of luck. A long-lasting heat dome will build early next week in the East and send temperatures soaring even higher.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/weather/summer-heat-pattern-central-southeast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

On Wednesday, police in the town of Bulla in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory shot the crocodile after deeming it a \u201csignificant risk to the community.\u201d In a statement, Northern Territory Police said the predator \u201chad been stalking and lunging out of the water at children and adults\u201d and had \u201calso reportedly taken multiple community dogs.\u201d In a waste-conscious move, the crocodile was \u201cprepared for a feast in the traditional manner,\u201d police said, but not before authorities took the opportunity to give local children an impromptu \u201ccrocodile safety session,\u201d including an \u201cup-close look at the dangers within our waterways.\u201d Speaking to public broadcaster ABC, Northern Territory Police Sergeant Andrew McBride said the animal was \u201ccooked up into crocodile tail soup, he was on the barbecue, a few of the pieces were wrapped up in banana leaves and cooked underground.\u201d \u201cIt was a rather large traditional feast and there were a few full bellies,\u201d Sergeant McBride said. Both the saltwater and freshwater crocodile species are protected in Australia, where hunting the animals has been banned by federal law since 1971 \u2013 a time when poaching had driven them close to extinction. Numbers have boomed in the decades since, with the Northern Territory now home to some 100,000 crocodiles, according to the local government. Thousands more crocodiles are distributed across the north of neighbouring states Queensland and Western Australia. \u201cAny body of water in The Top End may contain large and potentially dangerous crocodiles,\u201d said government wildlife specialist Kristen Hay, using a colloquial name for the Northern Territory. The territory\u2019s website notes that saltwater crocodiles can grow to six meters (20 feet), weigh up to a ton and \u201cwill eat just about anything.\u201d That means interactions between crocodiles and humans can be fatal, and park rangers across northern Australia remove hundreds of saltwater crocodiles from populated areas each year. In April, a 16-year-old boy was killed by a crocodile in northern Queensland while attempting to swim to shore after his boat broke down. Last year, the remains of a 64-year-old fisherman were recovered from inside a crocodile, also in Queensland.

It also outlines civil protection measures including transforming underground stations into makeshift bunkers and preparing hospitals for an influx of patients. Unveiling the plans, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said it was necessary for her country to arm itself better in the face of Russian aggression. \u201cThe Russian aggression has completely changed the security situation in Europe \u2013 first and foremost among our eastern EU and NATO partners such as in the Baltic States, but also due to hybrid threats such as cyber attacks, espionage and disinformation here,\u201d she said. \u201cIn addition to all the protective measures of our security authorities and military deterrence and defense, we must therefore also further strengthen civil protection.\u201d The document warns that Germany\u2019s hospitals would have to prepare to treat large numbers of patients over a long period of time. It adds\u00a0that, if war breaks out, the German population cannot count on \u201cgovernment-organized help\u201d to be provided immediately, due to the possibility \u201cof damage occurring simultaneously at a large number of locations.\u201d Therefore, it says, civilians must be ready to help themselves first, as well as provide help to neighbors where possible. Basements, underground car parks and subway stations should be used as temporary bunkers, the document states, adding that attacks could occur with \u201cextremely short warning times.\u201d Germany\u2019s broadcast and digital media will be required by law to share important government information immediately. As Germany\u2019s state broadcaster, Deutsche Welle would be legally obliged to provide the government with information regarding broadcasting times for the announcement of new laws, regulations and updates. Authorities will have the power to evacuate civilians to certain areas \u2013 although families should not be separated, the document states. While German weather services are expected to continue even in the event of an emergency, authorities could ban or restrict the publication of forecasts. \u2018Ready for war by 2029\u2019 Germany\u2019s updated wartime plans come as Russian President Vladimir Putin presents an ongoing security threat to Europe. His war in Ukraine is well into its second year, with no conclusive end in sight and fears that the conflict could spill over into a wider war involving NATO. On Wednesday, German Defensive Minister Pistorius was quoted by newspaper Der Spiegel as saying: \u201cWe must be ready for war by 2029.\u201d Pistorius added, \u201cWe must not believe that Putin will stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders when he gets that far.\u201d Similarly, voices from within the British government have expressed the need to be war-ready. Former UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace in February stated that \u201cwar is coming\u201d to Britain by the end of the decade, as he called for greater investment in defense. In recent weeks Russia has issued some of its starkest warnings to the West yet, in light of some of Ukraine\u2019s allies giving Kyiv permission to use their\u00a0weapons to strike limited targets inside Russian territory. Putin on Wednesday described the provision of Western weaponry as a \u201cvery serious and dangerous step,\u201d which he said could result in Moscow arming its enemies. The Russian leader specifically pointed to a breakdown in Russia\u2019s relations with Germany, claiming that the appearance of German tanks in Ukraine had resulted in an \u201cmoral, ethical shock,\u201d because \u201cthe attitude towards [Germany] in Russian society had always been very good, very good.\u201d \u201cNow, when they say that some more missiles will appear that will strike targets on Russian territory, this, of course, is ultimately destroying Russo-German relations,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/europe/germany-wartime-plans-russia-threat-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_americas_panama-migrants-darien-gap-intl-latam", "text": "Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to Panama\u2019s National Migration Service. The Dari\u00e9n Gap, which a decade ago was seen as an almost impassable barrier, has continued to see an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. According to migration service figures, a record 520,000 people crossed the jungle last year. Experts say many continue to journey towards the United States in search of better opportunities. The National Migration Service of Panama said Thursday that in the first six days of June 2024, at least 4,499 people \u2013 3,598 adults and 901 minors \u2013 arrived in the country. This comes as the number of children crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap has increased by 40% this year, putting the route on track to see record levels of child migration for the fifth consecutive year, according to a report by the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. The UNICEF report added that in the first four months of 2024, over 30,000 children crossed the Dari\u00e9n Gap, and that 2,000 were unaccompanied or separated from their families. This comes as Panamanian politicians seek to harden the country\u2019s borders. During his election campaign, Panama\u2019s president-elect Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said that he wanted to \u201cclose the Dari\u00e9n,\u201d citing safety concerns. He explained in early May that he had proposed to initiate \u201ca repatriation process with full respect for human rights\u201d for the hundreds of thousands of migrants who pass through the area each year. \u201cSo that those from there, and those who would like to come, know that those who arrive here will be returned to their country of origin,\u201d Mulino said. Mulino\u2019s plan may prove unfeasible given that the jungle is 266 kilometers (165 miles) long. Discouraging migrants from crossing could be a tough challenge since many of them pay human smugglers operating on both sides of the borders. \u201cIn practical terms, trying to reduce migration through the Dari\u00e9n is a difficult task. The complexity is not just about entry points, but how to manage and have better information on who is helping migrants get through,\u201d Ariel Ruiz, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, told CNN. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. Mass migration across the Western Hemisphere has\u00a0fueled a growing number\u00a0of people moving north. The journey carries multiple risks for migrants, including robberies, assaults, kidnappings, diseases, wild animal attacks, and accidents in a jungle full of rivers, mountains, and mud flats, according to the UN Refugee agency, UNHCR.

{"id": "2024_06_12_middleeast_andrey-kozlov-family-israel-hamas-gaza-intl", "text": "The family of\u00a0one of the hostages rescued in an Israeli operation over the weekend has said that he experienced psychological abuse over the hands of his Hamas captors during the eight months that he was held in Gaza. Andrey\u00a0Kozlov, 27, was rescued alongside Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan and Shlomi Ziv during a raid on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Saturday. The operation was only the third Israeli rescue of hostages held in Gaza and has been celebrated in Israel. But it left a trail of devastation, with authorities in Gaza saying at least 274 Palestinians were killed in the raid and the ensuing firefight with Hamas militants. Kozlov and the others were held in two civilian buildings in the densely packed territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said that the raid was carried out in the two buildings simultaneously for fear the captors would kill some of the hostages if they knew an operation was unfolding. A Russian citizen, Kozlov moved to Israel almost two years ago. He was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival on October 7 when he was kidnapped and taken into Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Kozlov\u2019s family revealed\u00a0some details of their son\u2019s ordeal, including that he initially believed the Israeli forces who saved him had been sent to kill him. Kozlov\u2019s father, Mikhail Kozlov, said his son was \u201cvery scared\u201d because Hamas militants had\u00a0for months\u00a0falsely said that \u201cIsrael wanted to kill them all\u201d\u00a0claiming \u201cthey were a problem for Israel\u201d. \u201cHe was told that Israel wants to kill him. He didn\u2019t understand why the IDF\u00a0came. He was afraid that the IDF came to kill him. It took him some time to realize that they came to rescue him.\u201d Mikhail said his son would not reveal all the ways he\u2019d been mistreated,\u00a0saying\u00a0\u201che wasn\u2019t seen as a human by them.\u201d \u201cI would say that they would punish him for any behavior that they considered was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the examples that Andrey gave us\u2026 is that at the hottest time of the day they would cover him with blankets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very difficult ordeal. To be dehydrated during heat.\u201d His\u00a0brother, Dmitry, said\u00a0\u201cthey were trying not to leave [physical] marks \u2026 But they would still punish him this way or the other. Very often for trivial things.\u201d \u201cHe was told not to speak in Hebrew, you need to whisper and [even that] in English.\u201d Describing their reunion, Mikhail said: \u201cThe first meeting was very touching\u2026 We expected to have a vibrant meeting and some joy, but instead, he knelt down and burst into tears and that was very moving for us.\u201d Dmitry said his brother feels indebted to Israel. \u201cHe says that he doesn\u2019t understand what he has done to deserve this generosity towards him, because he hasn\u2019t done anything. So he feels obliged to pass this goodness on to the next person and help get others [hostages] out.\u201d With the rescue of the four hostages, 116 remain in Gaza from the October 7 attacks, of which 41 are believed to be dead. Mikhail said that he was in favor of securing the release of the remaining hostages by any means \u2013 by negotiation, or further military action. \u201cIf it can be a deal, if a deal can help to release them, then be it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s possible to carry such an operation again, then it should be an operation for the release of these hostages. We need to use any means to return these people back to their families.\u201d \u2018A lot of abuse, almost every day\u2019 The doctor in charge of medical treatment for the four Israeli hostages rescued Saturday said they were beaten while in Hamas captivity in Gaza. \u201cIt was a harsh, harsh, experience, with a lot of abuse, almost every day,\u201d Dr. Itai Pessach told CNN. \u201cEvery hour, both physical, mental and other types, and that is something that is beyond comprehension.\u201d Pessach said the eight months spent in captivity \u201cleft a significant mark on their health\u201d and despite appearing in good condition initially, they are all malnourished.\u00a0 \u201cThey had no protein, so their muscles are extremely wasted, there is damage to some other systems because of that.\u201d He said the hostages told him they were moved several times, dealing with a number of different guards. The supply of food and water was unstable. \u201cThere have been periods where they got almost no food whatsoever, there were other periods where it was a little better, but all in all, the combination of the psychological stress, malnutrition or not getting enough food or not getting the right kind of food, medical neglect, being limited to space, not seeing the sun and all of the other things have significant effect on health.\u201d The testimony is the latest insight into conditions Hamas keeps hostages in. Other hostages\u00a0have previously outlined their ordeals. Keren Munder, her mother and her 9-year-old son \u2013 who were among scores of hostages released under a temporary truce last year - endured days with only pita bread to eat, according to her cousin Merav Mor Raviv. Munder and her mother both lost between six and eight kilograms in weight. Another hostage, 72-year-old Adina Moshe, endured \u201chorrible\u201d conditions while she was held captive, according to her nephew, who added that she didn\u2019t have access to basic facilities like a shower. Israel launched its war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage. Since then, the Israeli campaign has killed more than 37,000 people, according to the ministry of health in Gaza, and triggered a humanitarian crisis. Concerns over food insecurity and famine are growing, with a UN report warning recently that more than one million people, half of Gaza\u2019s population, are \u201cexpected to face death and starvation\u201d by mid-July.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/middleeast/andrey-kozlov-family-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea sent a new wave of trash-laden balloons toward its southern neighbor late Sunday, after Kim Jong Un\u2019s powerful sister warned of further responses if the South keeps up its \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d The new balloons, which Seoul has previously slammed as \u201cbase and dangerous,\u201d come in apparent retaliation for the decision by South Korea to resume broadcasting anti-North Korean\u00a0propaganda over loudspeakers in border areas. Kim\u2019s sister and government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation.\u201d In a statement carried by North Korean state media, Kim said South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d\u00a0from the North if it continued with the loudspeaker broadcasts and failed to prevent activists from\u00a0sending anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border. \u201cI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once this dangerous act,\u201d Kim said, adding that Seoul is creating a \u201cnew environment of crisis.\u201d South\u00a0Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\u00a0has maintained North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d In a statement Monday, a JCS spokesman would not say whether the South would continue to broadcast over the loudspeakers, noting only that\u00a0the military would conduct missions \u201cwith flexibility according to the strategic and operational situation.\u201d The escalating tit-for-tat has sparked concerns of potential retaliatory military action. Last week, the South Korean government suspended a 2018 deal\u00a0to reduce military tensions with the North, allowing it to resume propaganda broadcasts and potentially restart military exercises along the border. South Korea\u2019s military once routinely deployed propaganda broadcasts as a means of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following the 2018 deal. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d and the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and modern Korean culture, according to the JCS. Tit-for-tat balloons In recent weeks, the North has floated more than a thousand trash-filled balloons across the heavily fortified border, in what it claims is a response to the years-long practice among South Korean activist groups of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets in the other direction. As of Monday morning, the South Korean military had found \u201caround 50 balloons\u201d that fell into its territory overnight Sunday. Many other balloons are believed to have flown back into\u00a0North\u00a0Korea due to the wind, according to the JCS spokesman. On Thursday, South Korean activists sent balloons across the border toward the North, carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting\u00a0strict rules to snap back\u00a0into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

The police, fire brigade, coast guard and volunteers have spent days searching land and sea for the doctor, who did not take his phone with him.

The beach near where the body was found is not far from that area. \u201cWe had an incredibly lucky life together,\u201d Mosley\u2019s wife, Dr. Claire Bailey, said in a statement. \u201cWe loved each other very much and were so happy together.\u201d She said her husband \u201cdid an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team.\u201d The television doctor is known for UK documentary shows such as Channel 4\u2019s \u201cMichael Mosley: Who Made Britain Fat?\u201d and the BBC\u2019s \u201cTrust Me, I\u2019m A Doctor.\u201d Mosley popularized a type of intermittent fasting known as the\u00a05:2 diet, and authored a book on the fast 800 diet, which focuses on time-restricted eating for rapid weight loss.

{"id": "2024_06_12_middleeast_un-report-israel-hamas-gaza-war-crimes-intl-hnk", "text": "A United Nations inquiry into the first few months of the war in Gaza has found both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes and grave violations of international law, in the body\u2019s first in-depth investigation into the October 7 attacks and the ensuing conflict. The damning reports released Wednesday, which cover events up to the end of 2023,\u00a0paint an alarming picture of both sides routinely disregarding international law in a devastating conflict that has now raged for more than eight months, bitterly dividing global opinion and sending tensions soaring across the Middle East. The findings were strongly disputed by Israel. The United Nations Commission of Inquiry\u2019s reports begin on October 7, the day Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups launched a murder and kidnapping spree in southern Israel which\u00a0killed more than\u00a01,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw some 250 people taken hostage. War crimes cited by the commission that day included intentionally directing attacks against civilians,\u00a0murder or willful killing, torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and taking hostages, including children. The massacres that day prompted Israel\u00a0to declare war on Hamas and launch an assault on Gaza that has destroyed much of the heavily populated enclave and killed more than 37,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities. In the first 2.5 months of the conflict, the commission found, Israel committed war crimes as well as crimes against humanity \u2013 the latter defined as a widespread, systemic attack directed at a civilian population. Israel\u2019s alleged war crimes include starvation, arbitrary detention, and killing and maiming \u201ctens of thousands of children.\u201d Both Israel and Hamas committed sexual violence and torture, and intentionally attacked civilians, according to the reports, which span more than 200 pages. The commission said its findings were based on interviews with victims and witnesses, thousands of open-source items verified through forensic analysis, hundreds of submissions, satellite imagery, forensic medical reports and media coverage, including several key CNN investigations. Israel previously announced its refusal to cooperate with the inquiry. CNN is reaching out Hamas for comment. In response to the report, Israel accused the fact-finding mission of \u201cattempting to justify\u201d Hamas\u2019 actions, of showing \u201csystematic anti-Israeli discrimination,\u201d and contextualizing the attacks \u201cthrough the lens of the Palestinian narrative.\u201d Israel\u2019s mission to the UN said Wednesday that the report did not mention continuous rocket fire on the country and claimed that it \u201coutrageously and repugnantly attempts to draw a false equivalence between IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers and Hamas terrorists with regards to acts of sexual violence,\u201d adding that the Israeli military conducts itself in accordance to international law, including international humanitarian law. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States continues \u201cto do the work to make our own assessments\u201d on whether there have been violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the war in Gaza. Speaking at a news conference in Doha, the top US diplomat said he had not seen the new UN findings, but said that \u201cof course we\u2019ll look at that.\u201d The reports released Wednesday add to previous allegations made against Israel by other major international bodies. The International Criminal Court announced last month it was seeking arrest warrants for several top Hamas and Israeli leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. At the time, both Hamas and Israel decried the charges \u2013 with Hamas describing it as an attempt to \u201cequate victims with aggressors,\u201d and Netanyahu calling it a \u201cpolitical outrage.\u201d And in February, the Israeli military denied accusations by UN experts of human rights violations against Palestinian girls and women in Gaza and the West Bank \u2013 calling the claims \u201cdespicable and unfounded.\u201d October 7 attacks The report examined Hamas\u2019 actions during the October 7 attacks, which it described as\u00a0\u201cunprecedented in scale in (Israel\u2019s) modern history\u2026 invoking painful trauma of past persecution not only for Israeli Jews but for Jewish people everywhere.\u201d Hamas militants abducted hostages \u201cwithout regard for age or gender,\u201d with some shot at, killed, and paraded around, the report said. In particular, they targeted women, whose bodies were \u201cused as victory trophies by male perpetrators\u2026 (and) put on public display, either on the streets of the Gaza Strip or online,\u201d it found. The commission said it had \u201cdocumented evidence of sexual violence\u201d carried out by Palestinian armed groups in several locations in southern Israel on October 7. The commission had also reviewed rape testimonies collected by journalists and Israeli police but said it was unable to independently verify these due to lack of access to the victims or crime sites, and because Israel obstructed its investigations. The report authors singled out the toll on Israeli children \u2013 many of whom witnessed the murders of their parents and siblings, and were targeted for abduction. Israeli forces inflicting \u2018maximum damage\u2019 In Israel\u2019s subsequent attack on Hamas, the commission wrote, its forces aimed to inflict \u201cmaximum damage\u201d without taking enough precautions \u2013 which led to a staggering death toll in Gaza, devastating injuries, and destruction of civilian infrastructure. \u201cThe deliberate use of heavy weaponry by Israeli security forces with large destructive capabilities in densely populated areas constitutes an intentional and direct attack on the civilian population, particularly affecting women and children,\u201d the commission said. It also referenced CNN reporting that found that\u00a0nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions\u00a0Israel used in Gaza were unguided, meaning they\u00a0were less precise and posed a greater threat to civilians in the densely populated strip. Asked for comment at the time, IDF spokesperson Nir Dinar told CNN: \u201cWe do not address the type of munitions used.\u201d The UN\u2019s report cited two other CNN investigations that showed Israeli forces intentionally killing civilians who posed no threat, often along evacuation routes and in designated safe areas. The siege of Gaza represents a \u201ccollective punishment against the civilian population,\u201d according to the\u00a0UN report \u2013 which accused Israel of withholding critical goods like water, food, electricity, fuel and humanitarian aid for \u201cstrategic and political gains.\u201d Sexual violence and inflammatory rhetoric The report detailed allegations of Israeli forces carrying out sexual violence in both Gaza and the Israel-occupied West Bank \u2013 intended to drive home \u201cthe subordination of an occupied people.\u201d Victims were allegedly interrogated or abused while naked or partially dressed, blindfolded, and made to kneel or keep their hands tied behind their backs, the report found. Many were forced to strip in public and walk while being sexually harassed, with their family members forced to watch. While both men and women were victims of sexual violence, men and boys were targeted in particular. The report also highlighted the inflammatory rhetoric used by senior Israeli officials, including the president and prime minister, which the UN commission said amounted to incitement and \u201cmay constitute other serious international crimes.\u201d Some Israeli officials had called for \u201cviolence and the killing of Palestinians, the erasure of the Gaza Strip, vengeance, collective punishment, noting that there are no innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, planning for new Israeli settlements on the rubble of the Gaza Strip and calling for the removal of Palestinians from Gaza to third states,\u201d the report said, without attributing to specific officials. Some of the most extreme statements in Israel\u2019s deeply divided cabinet have come from far-right members like National Security Minister Itamar\u00a0Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. They are often condemned by other cabinet members like Benny Gantz, who resigned on Sunday, and\u00a0Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. UN-Israel tensions The commission, which was set up by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 after an 11-day conflict that killed more than 200 people in both Israel and Gaza, said Israel had obstructed its access to both Israel and Palestinian territories during the investigation. It said Israeli officials had barred medical professionals and other personnel from speaking to investigators, and did not respond to any UN requests for information. The commission also requested information from the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, it said. The Palestinian Authority provided \u201cextensive comments\u201d and indicated they would welcome a visit by the UN, the commission said. Hamas, a rival to the Palestinian Authority, governs Gaza and it was not clear from the report whether the authors had also contacted the militant group. In December, Israeli Ambassador to the UN\u00a0Gilad Erdan accused the UN\u2019s Human Rights Council of being \u201cmorally distorted\u201d and antisemitic. Erdan called its investigation \u201c100% biased against Israel,\u201d and said Israel would not cooperate. The UN and Israel\u2019s long-strained relations have sunk to a historic low in recent months, with senior UN officials highly critical of Israel\u2019s war conduct in Gaza. The UN Security Council \u2013 which Israel is not part of \u2013 tried for months after October 7 to pass a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. The US, Israel\u2019s closest ally and its main weapons supplier, consistently used its veto power to block such a move \u2013 until it finally abstained in March, allowing the resolution to pass, which was immediately lambasted by Israel. And last month, a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly showed\u00a0overwhelming international support\u00a0for an independent Palestinian state \u2013 leaving the US and Israel\u2019s allies isolated. Israel and the US maintain that a Palestinian state should only be established through a negotiated settlement. Another sticking point is UNRWA, the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, which plays a central role in feeding and sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israeli officials have long criticized UNRWA, accusing it of diverting aid to Hamas as well as having Hamas members in its ranks. More than a dozen countries suspended funding to the agency after Israel\u00a0accused at least 12 UNRWA staffers\u00a0of being involved in the October 7 terrorist attacks. Most have since resumed funding. In March, the agency accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, coercing them into making false confessions about the agency\u2019s ties to Hamas. In recent months, UNRWA has faced threats, harassment and violence perpetrated by Israelis \u2013 with the East Jerusalem headquarters set on fire while staff were inside. CNN cannot confirm the allegations by Israel or UNRWA. In their report on Wednesday, the commission authors urged Israel to immediately call a ceasefire, for Hamas to release hostages, for Israel to end its practices of sexual abuse against Palestinians, and to allow access for further investigations. \u201cIt is imperative that all those who have committed crimes be held accountable,\u201d said commission chair Navi Pillay. \u201cThe only way to stop the recurring cycles of violence, including aggression and retribution by both sides, is to ensure strict adherence to international law.\u201d This story has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/middleeast/un-report-israel-hamas-gaza-war-crimes-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_07_uk_rishi-sunak-d-day-event-uk-election-gbr-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has apologized for leaving the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day early in order to film a TV interview, a decision that prompted incredulity and further derailed his floundering general election campaign. Sunak attended the first part of the commemorative events in Normandy, France, on Thursday, but skipped the international ceremony at Omaha Beach, which was attended by other world leaders and veterans of the Allied operation in 1944. \u201cThe last thing I want is for the commemorations to be overshadowed by politics,\u201d Sunak wrote in a long apology on X. \u201cAfter the conclusion of the British event in Normandy, I returned back to the UK. On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer \u2013 and I apologise.\u201d But the move had already caused anger and disbelief in Britain, and represented another major miscalculation in Sunak\u2019s faltering election campaign. Sunak left the event to record a campaign interview with broadcaster ITV, the network confirmed, in which he defended claims about the opposition Labour Party\u2019s tax plans which fact-checkers and a senior civil servant have said were misleading or inaccurate. More than 20 heads of state and government, and representatives from royal families across Europe, attended the international ceremony, which took place on a day of commemoration 80 years after the Allied beach landings in Nazi-occupied France laid the groundwork for the defeat of Germany in World War II. \u201cLook, I get the outrage. I get that this is a significant mistake,\u201d Sunak\u2019s own veterans minister, Johnny Mercer, told UK newspaper The Sun on Friday, while also attacking what he labelled as \u201cfaux outrage\u201d from Sunak\u2019s critics. The UK was represented at the international ceremony by David Cameron, Sunak\u2019s foreign secretary and a former prime minister, who took photographs alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden. Also in attendance was Labour leader Keir Starmer, who was filmed speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the event. Labour was quick to condemn Sunak\u2019s decision to skip the events, and the gaffe dominated British news coverage of the election on Friday. Speaking to reporters on Friday,\u00a0Sunak\u00a0said that his leaving early was a \u201cmistake,\u201d but added\u00a0that \u201cit\u2019s important though, given the enormity of the sacrifice made, that we don\u2019t politicize this.\u201d \u201cThe focus should rightly be on the veterans who gave so much,\u201d he said, before stating that he \u201cwill always be proud of our record in supporting veterans here in the UK.\u201d Sunak\u2019s campaign began with a rain-soaked speech outside Downing Street and has been beset by questionable decision-making and optically damaging events, all while failing to shift a cavernous poll deficit \u2013 but Thursday\u2019s D-Day error felt like the most perplexing and detrimental moment of the campaign so far. He was already batting back accusations from Labour that he lied about the cost of the opposition party\u2019s tax plans \u2013 a topic in the debate he filmed with ITV on Thursday night. The UK Treasury flatly contradicted Sunak\u2019s claim in a TV debate Tuesday that its impartial officials had calculated Labour plans would \u201cput up everyone\u2019s taxes by \u00a32,000.\u201d Labour\u2019s policy manifesto has not yet been published, and the party says its agenda is fully costed. ITV News said its team had not specifically requested to speak to the prime minister on Thursday, and that the date was in fact put forward by Sunak\u2019s team, despite it falling on the anniversary of D-Day. \u201cToday was the slot that we were offered, we don\u2019t know why. Obviously it\u2019s not our choice, but he certainly returned from Normandy ready to dive back into the campaign,\u201d ITV\u2019s UK Editor Paul Brand, who carried out the interview, stated in an ITV\u00a0report on Thursday night. \u201cYesterday\u2019s D-Day commemorations were about remembering the bravery of all those who serve our country,\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s Shadow Paymaster General, said Friday\ufeff. \u201cIn choosing to prioritise his own vanity TV appearances over our veterans, Rishi Sunak has shown what is most important to him.\u201d Sunak is projected to lose the election on July 4 to Labour by a hefty margin, and his campaign has failed to land a decisive moment that could swing opinion polls in his favor. In recent days his efforts were dealt a further blow when Nigel Farage, an architect of Brexit and a populist thorn in the side of numerous Conservative leaders, announced he would lead the Reform Party\u2019s campaign, directly appealing to right-leaning Tory backers to abandon Sunak and vote for his insurgent group. Farage also leapt on Sunak\u2019s lapse in judgment, writing on X that the Prime Minister \u201ccould not even be bothered to attend the international event above Omaha Beach.\u201d In another post, he added: \u201cPatriotic people who love their country should not vote for him.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/uk/rishi-sunak-d-day-event-uk-election-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_israel-gaza-un-security-council-ceasefire-intl-hnk", "text": "Israel has vowed to persist with its military operation in Gaza, saying it won\u2019t engage in \u201cmeaningless\u201d negotiations with Hamas, shortly after the United Nations Security Council overwhelmingly approved a US-backed ceasefire plan intended to bring an end to the eight-month war. Israel\u2019s representative to the UN, Reut Shapir Ben-Naftaly, emphasized at a UNSC meeting Monday that her country wants to \u201censure that Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future.\u201d The senior diplomat said the war would not end until all hostages were returned and Hamas\u2019 capabilities were \u201cdismantled,\u201d accusing the Palestinian militant group of using \u201cendless negotiations\u2026 as a means to stall for time.\u201d Her comments came after 14 of the 15 UNSC council members voted in favor of Monday\u2019s US-drafted resolution, with only Russia abstaining \u2013 the first time the council has endorsed such a plan to end the war. Israel is not a member of the\u00a0UNSC, and so did not vote. The comprehensive three-stage peace deal, which sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces, was first laid out by US President Joe Biden on May 31. The landmark vote means the UNSC now joins other major global bodies in backing the plan, increasing international pressure on both Hamas and Israel to end the conflict. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on a diplomatic trip to the Middle East, said Tuesday that in a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli leader \u201creaffirmed his commitment\u201d to the current proposal to secure a ceasefire and hostage release, which is still awaiting an answer from Hamas. Blinken said that he got an explicit assurance from Netanyahu that he continues to support the deal, and will accept it if Hamas agrees to what is on the table. Netanyahu has repeatedly and publicly said that his country will press on with the war in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed and the hostages are freed. But an Israeli statement on Tuesday indicated it was poised to formally sign up to the current ceasefire plan for Gaza, while at the same time maintaining the freedom to keep fighting. The short communication issued Tuesday, attributed only to an Israeli government official, though widely understood to mean the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, started with an assertion of Israel\u2019s war aims before expressing support for the US-backed proposal currently on the table. \u201cIsrael will not end the war before achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future,\u201d it said. \u201cThe proposal presented enables Israel to achieve these goals and Israel will indeed do so,\u201d the statement concluded. Israel and Hamas react Hamas welcomed the adoption of the UNSC resolution, saying in a statement it was ready to engage with mediators to implement measures such as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, prisoner exchange, returning residents to their homes and the \u201crejection of any demographic change or reduction in the area of the Gaza Strip.\u201d The resolution says Israel has accepted the plan, and US officials have repeatedly emphasized Israel had agreed to the proposal \u2013 despite other public comments from Netanyahu that suggest otherwise. Even last month, less than an hour after Biden unveiled his proposal, Netanyahu insisted Israel would not end the war until Hamas is defeated. The\u00a0United States\u00a0ambassador to the\u00a0UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Monday the US would guarantee Israel follows through with its obligations, while Egypt and Qatar would do the same with Hamas. \u201cThe fighting could stop today,\u201d if Hamas agreed to the deal, she said. But detailed negotiations to implement its provisions are yet to yield agreement from both Israel and Hamas. The deal is divided into three phases, according to Thomas-Greenfield. It includes an initial ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately a permanent end to hostilities and full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, as well as the effective distribution of aid and a major multiyear reconstruction in the strip. The ambassador also said the deal \u201crejects any geographical changes\u201d in Gaza and reiterates the commitment for a two-state solution. The Palestinian UN envoy Riyad\u00a0Mansour said the Palestinian Authority \u2013 which governs\u00a0the Israeli-occupied West Bank \u2013 welcomed the deal as a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d but said it was up to Israel to implement those measures. \u201cWe want a ceasefire,\u201d he said, adding the \u201cburden is on the Israeli side to implement this resolution.\u201d \u201cThe proof is in the pudding. We will see who are the ones who are interested to see this resolution to become a reality and those who are obstructing it and want to continue the war of genocide against our people,\u201d he added. US pushes for Israeli support on deal Ahead of the vote, Blinken told Netanyahu during their meeting in Jerusalem that the proposal would \u201cunlock the possibility of calm along\u00a0Israel\u2019s northern border and further integration with countries in the region,\u201d according to a State Department readout. \u201cThe United States and other world leaders will stand behind\u201d the proposal for a release of the hostages and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Blinken told Netanyahu. After the resolution was adopted, Blinken spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, where he \u201ccommended\u00a0Israel\u2019s readiness to conclude a deal and affirmed that the onus is on Hamas to accept,\u201d according to a readout of their meeting. Blinken arrived in Israel on Monday, following the resignation of Benny Gantz from the Israeli war cabinet on Sunday. Gantz\u2019s departure delivered a blow to Netanyahu, who is coming under increasing pressure from Western allies and families of hostages to end the war and bring back the captives. Gantz stressed to Blinken\u00a0in their meeting the importance of \u201capplying maximum pressure\u201d on negotiators to secure Hamas\u2019 agreement to the latest ceasefire plan and bring those being held in Gaza home, according to a statement from Gantz\u2019s office. It added that Gantz said his party would support \u201cany responsible arrangement\u201d on the matter from outside the government. There has been confusion about whose proposal this is, however. Biden has called it an \u201cIsraeli proposal,\u201d but less than an hour after Biden announced the plan in May,\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0said his country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated. Biden has said Hamas has been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack, and that now \u201cit\u2019s time for this war to end.\u201d The Israeli prime minister, however, is yet to publicly announce whether his country has accepted or rejected the US-drafted proposal. Eight months since the war began, Israel is yet to achieve its stated objectives as most of Hamas\u2019 top leadership remains at large, while earlier this week, Israeli military officials estimated around 120 hostages remain captive, of which around 70 are thought to still be alive. More than 37,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. CNN cannot verify the\u00a0numbers provided by the ministry, which does not distinguish between casualties among fighters and civilians. It does not include in its figures the several thousand people thought to be missing, or those still under the rubble in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0since October 7.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/israel-gaza-un-security-council-ceasefire-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "travel_four-seasons-gresham-palace-budapest-hotel", "text": "For most of the last century, the story of the Gresham Palace closely mirrored that of the city in which it was built. Built at the turn of the 20th century in prosperous Budapest, it quickly became the Hungarian capital\u2019s hottest address. After enduring two world wars, it suffered neglect under communism before rising majestically, once again, in June 2004 to become one of the city\u2019s, perhaps even central Europe\u2019s, grandest hotels. This summer, the building \u2013 one of the finest examples of Art Nouveau design in Budapest \u2013 is celebrating two decades in its most recent incarnation, as the Four Seasons Gresham Palace, a luxury hotel with panoramic views of the mighty Danube river. The anniversary marks a new milestone in the preservation of this architectural gem that was both ahead of its time when it was built and very much a celebration of the intellectual golden age in which it emerged. The Gresham Palace was conceived around the time that Budapest emerged as one of Europe\u2019s largest cities after the 19th-century unification of affluent Buda on one side of the Danube with rapidly developing Pest on the other, and the absorption of nearby town \u00d3buda. At the time, the Chain Bridge was the main link across the river, and so it was decided to build the palace on the Pest side to act as a kind of bricks-and-mortar gatekeeper. \u201cAfter the unification of Buda, Pest and \u00d3buda in 1873, Budapest became a big cosmopolitan city, a European capital,\u201d J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky, director of the cultural heritage studies program at Central European University, tells CNN. \u201cBuda and Pest, for a long time, were only connected by the Chain Bridge, thus Sz\u00e9chenyi Square at the end of the bridge on the Pest side was one of the most prominent public spaces with Gresham Palace overlooking them both.\u201d Passionate affair Widely adored today, Gresham\u2019s construction in 1906 was also a story of affection \u2013 it\u2019s also known locally as the \u201cpalace of hearts.\u201d Heart motifs carved into the building were said to be added by the architect, Zsigmond Quittner, because of his love for a future tenant of the palace. Another more probable tale says the hearts were inspired by a passionate affair between Countess Irma Sz\u00e9chenyi and Thomas Gresham, an Englishman behind the building\u2019s construction. Gresham was said to have gifted Sz\u00e9chenyi a heart-shaped pendant which she asked to be woven into the fabric of the palace. Quittner, who won a commission from the Gresham Life Assurance Company, to build the palace, delivered, along with the help of his associate J\u00f3zsef V\u00e1g\u00f3, a prime example of Art Nouveau architecture, infused with the avant-garde flair of Vienna and Paris of that era. It was built to reflect the grandeur of the powerful Austro-Hungarian empire at the time, with lavish interiors and detailed ironwork. Renowned glass-painter and mosaic-maker Miksa Ro\u0301th was also brought in to create ornate exterior glass mosaics and stained glass windows. The palace was not only an architectural triumph but also a hub of technological innovation, featuring central heating and a pioneering dust extraction system. The building also boasted a T-shaped shopping arcade with a glass roof, a novel concept in Budapest in the early 1900s. Upon its completion, Gresham Palace instantly became Budapest\u2019s most sought-after address \u2013 as a place to live for the wealthy, and somewhere to shop and be seen in the exclusive boutiques and cafes on the ground floor. Throughout its history, the palace served Budapest as a cultural hotspot, housing the famous Gresham-Venezia Caf\u00e9 and the P\u00f3dium Cabaret, known for its satirical and sometimes politically daring performances. However, the Soviets\u2019 siege of Budapest in 1944 left the building heavily damaged, and subsequent nationalization under communist rule in 1948 led to further decline. Influential artists \u201cGresham Palace and its coffee house were famous among artists and collectors,\u201d says Laszlovszky. \u201cThe so-called Gresham-circle was an informal, but very important, artistic meeting place before World War II. \u201cMembers of the circle, like R\u00f3bert Ber\u00e9ny, P\u00e1l P\u00e1tzay, B\u00e9ni Ferenczy, J\u00f3zsef Egry, Istv\u00e1n Sz\u0151nyi were painters or sculptors, the best artists of the period. Interestingly, they followed different artistic trends, but they were all influential people in the art life of the period.\u201d Despite suffering during wartime and enduring decades of neglect, the palace\u2019s spirit seemed to survive intact until 2001, when luxury hotel group Four Seasons embarked on an ambitious three-year project to restore the building\u2019s original splendor while integrating modern luxuries. A team of leading Hungarian architects, interior designers and craftsmen was assembled for the project. Architect Gabor Kruppa was responsible for the complete reconstruction of the palace, alongside restoration artist Mikl\u00f3s Szenkir\u00e1lyi. \u201cIt took thousands and thousands of hours for a unique team of highly trained masters from a variety of trades to cut this magnificent, Art Nouveau gem into a brilliant jewel,\u201d Szenkir\u00e1lyi said at the time. \u201cThe Gresham Palace has been born again in wonderful unity, serving as a crown jewel of outstanding beauty that complements our magnificent Chain Bridge.\u201d \u2018Extraordinary history\u2019 Since its reopening in 2004, the Four Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace has provided visitors with a well-appointed sanctuary, offering 179 rooms and suites with panoramic views of the Danube or the cityscape. Its interiors, from the grand lobby to the spa atop, exude a regal air. \u201cGresham Palace is one of Budapest\u2019s most iconic buildings, and today, through its mere existence, unique location, and architecture, it shapes the image that the city presents to any tourist wishing to explore it,\u201d Thibaut Drege, the hotel\u2019s general Manager, tells CNN Travel. \u201cThe fact that Four Seasons was able, 20 years ago, to renovate such a jewel reflects the extraordinary history that this building has undergone since its creation. Ultimately, it is this architecture that reflects an era when Budapest held a prominent position as a destination for high society Europeans. The city is now reclaiming this position, with growing interest notably from high-end travelers.\u201d As well as luxurious accommodation, guests and visitors of the hotel can also enjoy some of Budapest\u2019s top dining and relaxation spots. These include KOLL\u00c1ZS, a contemporary French brasserie which offers what\u2019s arguably the grandest setting in Budapest. The venue serves local Tokaji wines, artisan cocktails and a menu crafted by Executive Chef \u00c1rp\u00e1d Gy\u0151rffy, one of the finalists at the prestigious Bocuse d\u2019Or Hungary competition. The hotel\u2019s MU\u0301ZSA bar also offers artisan cocktails plus Asian food in a setting designed to transport visitors to Budapest\u2019s golden age. The venue also has a cultural program with ballet evenings and live performances. In a city renowned for its thermal baths, there\u2019s inevitably also a luxurious spa, offering steam rooms, a relaxation pool and a \u201cHungarian Moor Mud\u201d treatment, that\u2019s said to be popular with Hollywood A-listers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/four-seasons-gresham-palace-budapest-hotel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_isis-children-detention-syria-intl-cmd", "text": "He had had visitors just once before, years ago when he first arrived in prison at 14. Blindfolded and led into a room by a masked guard, he said he was made to sit on a plastic chair under a cold fluorescent light and questioned by American officials. Stefan Uterloo, now 19, told them he had an uncle in the United States but couldn\u2019t remember where. He suspects they lost interest when they realized he wasn\u2019t American but instead from Suriname, a small, former Dutch colony in South America. Five years later, Uterloo still spends every day with 25 other young men in a single cell in Panorama, a maximum-security prison in northeastern Syria, where CNN interviewed him. Built with funding from the US-led coalition against ISIS and run by the coalition\u2019s ally, the Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF, a Kurdish-led militia, Panorama holds some of the most dangerous ISIS members captured in 2019 after the fall of the group\u2019s so-called caliphate that, at its height, stretched across eastern Syria and western Iraq. Also among the nearly 4,000 ISIS male detainees that the SDF says are held there are an estimated 600 boys and young men detained as boys, according to Amnesty International.\u00a0Like Uterloo, many were brought to Syria, through no fault of their own, by their parents to live under ISIS rule. Now they are coming of age in prison. Many have no idea why they are being held, or what will happen to them. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the big guys,\u201d Uterloo said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re speaking about the kids, and if you want to know the truth, we don\u2019t even know why we are always punished. It\u2019s like five years in this prison \u2026 We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve been in prison because of our parents.\u201d The United Nations and rights groups have long warned of the humanitarian and legal crises facing the children of ISIS fighters, who have been kept in camps and detention facilities in northeastern Syria for years. But there has been little consensus on what to do with them. Now, as the US raises the alarm that the militant group is trying to reestablish itself and launch attacks on the West, it is renewing efforts to repatriate fighters and their families to face justice at home. According to Amnesty, the estimated 30,000 children currently held in at least 27 detention facilities and two detention camps \u2013\u00a0Al-Hol and Al-Roj\u00a0\u2013 in northeastern Syria represent the highest concentration of children arbitrarily detained and deprived of their freedom anywhere in the world. CNN was granted extremely rare access inside detention camps and facilities for suspected ISIS fighters and their family members, including Panorama prison. It was the first time the SDF had allowed journalists inside Panorama since 2021 and came just a month after Amnesty released a report accusing the SDF of holding detainees in \u201cinhumane conditions.\u201d The advocacy group cited detainees who said they were subjected to torture and denied access to adequate food and medical care in Panorama, leading to a severe outbreak of tuberculosis inside the prison. The SDF has been quick to dispute the claims of widespread and systematic abuse. Its top commander Mazloum Abdi told CNN that the group\u2019s allegations, \u201care not mirroring the reality.\u201d \u201cInstead of these organizations condemning what we are doing and calling it human rights violations, these organizations should give us help when it comes to our program that we have in place for years,\u201d Mazloum said. In the two cells that CNN was allowed to view under SDF supervision, detainees appeared to be in decent physical condition, sitting cross-legged in clean, recently built, air-conditioned spaces. But the SDF did admit that tuberculosis is rampant in the prison, accounting for five deaths per month, and coughing was audible in the hallways. Officials told CNN that detainees spend up to 23 hours per day in their cells and are held indefinitely without charge. Advocacy groups say the circumstances amount to \u201ca legal black hole,\u201d even worse than the US\u2019 Guantanamo Bay detention facility. \u2018A breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS\u2019 At Al-Hol, a sprawling detention camp of faded tents, rusted barbed wire and wind-swept earth, the scale of the problem reveals itself. There are just over 40,000 people in the camp, where individuals with ISIS affiliations live alongside the displaced, some of them victims of ISIS themselves. A high-security annex holds some 6,700 women and children with links to ISIS fighters from more than 60 countries, who were swept up and dumped in Al-Hol as the SDF cornered and finally defeated the group in its last stronghold, Baghouz in eastern Syria, in 2019. More than half of the camp\u2019s population are children, the majority under 12 years old. Beyond the legal ramifications of their arbitrary and indefinite detention, there are clear security risks as well. Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of the US military\u2019s Central Command, said in a statement after one of his visits to Al-Hol in 2022 that the camp was \u201ca ticking time bomb.\u201d \u201cThis place is a literal breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cThese young people are vulnerable to radicalization given their very poor quality of life.\u201d Speaking to CNN, one senior US government official put it more bluntly: \u201cISIS wants to keep everyone there loyal and primed.\u201d Every month a couple dozen 10- to 15-year-old boys are smuggled out of Al-Hol to ISIS training camps, according to the official. During periodic security raids of Al-Hol, SDF officials say they routinely find cell phone videos of the training, along with horrifying evidence of extrajudicial killings by ISIS supporters. In one video, shared for the first time with CNN, a woman is accused of collaborating with camp administrators. She is beaten and then beheaded inside Al-Hol \u2013 the kind of brutal ISIS extrajudicial punishment that the world hoped it would never see again. The SDF and the US have been pushing countries to repatriate citizens from Syria, telling CNN that it is the only viable solution to this complex and dangerous situation. Al-Hol\u2019s population has been reduced by 42% from a peak of over 73,000 in 2019, according to US officials who say the process has been too slow and many, including close allies which can more easily revoke citizenship than the US, are still dragging their feet. \u201cIt\u2019s unhelpful,\u201d the senior US official told CNN. Complicating matters, the bulk of the camp\u2019s detainees are from countries without any allegiance to the US-led coalition, among them Russians, Chinese Uyghurs and Syrians from regime-held areas, making the prospect of permanently closing Al-Hol unrealistic, at least for now. At the current rate of repatriation, officials say it will at least take an additional seven years to halve the camp\u2019s current population. Taken from their mothers at night As a stopgap, the SDF has introduced an official policy that separates boys at 14 from their mothers, placing them in two purpose-built facilities that it calls \u201crehabilitation\u201d centers. CNN met children as young as 11 in one of the centers, suggesting that camp officials are going beyond that policy. One woman in Al-Hol claimed her 10-year-old son was detained for trying to escape the camp, and that boys are often taken away at age 12. The SDF says the policy is necessary to stop boys from being radicalized by their mothers and to prevent the next generation of ISIS fighters from being born in the camps. They point to the 60 births per month recorded at Al-Hol as proof that young boys are already being married off. But the policy is an absolute breach of international law, according to former UN Special Rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights Fionnuala N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in. \u201cIt runs us into the area of a war crime,\u201d\u00a0N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in\u00a0told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s no legal process to justify it \u2026 you must have a court process and taking the child away from a mother is an absolute last resort, when you\u2019ve tried everything else. And it\u2019s neither a last resort nor a legal process, it\u2019s generally a pretty violent, arbitrary process.\u201d \u201cNo one is disputing that the situation in Al-Hol is both suboptimal, dangerous, inappropriate to children, with exposure to structural and direct violence, but it\u2019s also not taking responsibility for the very existence of those camps,\u201d she added. The alternative, say SDF officials, is far worse. Compared to Al-Hol, the Orkesh \u201crehabilitation\u201d center, where some boys and young men are detained, seems like a sanctuary. Its inner courtyard is dominated by a soccer field, where nearly every morning before the day\u2019s blazing heat sets in, Shamil Chakar takes to goal. Chakar is hard to miss. The tall, lanky teenager,\u00a0originally from Cologne, Germany, was taken by his parents to the former capital of ISIS\u2019 self-declared caliphate, Raqqa. He moves with ease on the field, but a shrapnel injury, a large scar from which is still visible on his head, has left him confused. When he sits down to talk, he doesn\u2019t know his own age. But the memory of the night he was taken from Al-Hol by SDF security forces is fresh. \u201cA man came and pulled me up and tied my hand behind my back,\u201d Shamil said. \u201cMy mom was screaming, she said \u2018leave him alone.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to go with them. He pushed me, saying put on your shoes, but I didn\u2019t. Then he hit me.\u201d Other boys have similar stories of violent separation. All miss their mothers. But their lives have also changed dramatically. At the center, they have rooms with beds, three meals per day and psychological support five days a week. \u2018I would choose an American prison any day\u2019 Second chances are nearly impossible to come by. For those in detention, repentance is demanded, and forgiveness rarely given. But when it does happen, it\u2019s at Al-Roj camp. It is much smaller and more manageable than Al-Hol, and it is where international detainees are transferred before repatriation. In early May, 50-year-old American Brandy Salman and her nine children, aged 7 to 26, along with two young sons of a Minnesota man, left Al-Roj in what was one of the largest repatriations back to the US to date. Roughly a dozen Americans remain in Al-Roj, according to US officials, who are seeking to bring them back. But for now, Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman, isn\u2019t one of them. She has been stuck in Al-Roj for more than five years with her now 7-year-old son. She\u2019s well-known in the camp for being outspoken. She doesn\u2019t wear a face veil and scrawled F-ISIS on the wall outside her tent. Raised in Alabama, she left her family at the age of 20 to live under ISIS after having been drawn in by the group\u2019s propaganda on social media. She became a noted ISIS propagandist herself, cheering their attacks in posts on Twitter, now X, and calling on others to join the self-declared caliphate. Muthana denies personally posting the tweets, telling CNN her phone was taken when she joined ISIS, a decision she deeply regrets. As her son grows older, nearing the age of the forced separation policy, she lives in constant fear for his future. Her American lawyers are continuing to push for her repatriation and that of her son, after the Trump administration revoked her passport on a technicality in 2019 and said that she was not a citizen. Left with few remaining options after the Supreme Court refused to hear her appeal, her legal team has directly petitioned the State Department for a certificate of identity to prove her status. A State Department spokesperson told CNN it had not changed its position regarding Muthana\u2019s citizenship status.\u00a0\u201cHoda Muthana is not a US citizen.\u00a0As the State Department determined and the courts agreed, she is not and never was a US citizen. For privacy reasons, we are unable to provide further comment,\u201d the spokesperson said. Muthana\u2019s lawyer Christina Jump told CNN the department\u2019s stance is hypocritical at best and dishonest at worst. \u201cThe\u00a0US has taken a high and mighty approach in lecturing other countries that they need to repatriate.\u00a0If Hoda Muthana is not a US citizen, then she is stateless and that is a violation of international law and that directly contradicts what the US government has stated that other countries cannot and should not do,\u201d Jump said. \u201cThey also are ignoring completely that at the very least there is a grandchild of US citizens who remains in that camp that they have known about for years now.\u201d Inside a tent surrounded by her son\u2019s toys and books, Muthana told CNN that all she wanted was to go home to the US, even if it meant being in prison. \u201cIf I had any time to serve, I would serve it and I would come out and begin my life with my son,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I were to have the choice between American prison and this camp, I would choose an American prison any day.\u201d CreditsVideo journalist: Scott McWhinnieVideo editors: Oscar Featherstone and Augusta Anthony\ufeffGraphics editor: Lou RobinsonPhoto editor: Sarah TilottaEditors: Eliza Mackintosh and Laura Smith-Spark", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/isis-children-detention-syria-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_tech_hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk", "text": "They hire their Uber through the app just like any other passenger, and hop in the back of the car. But halfway through the ride, the mood changes and they reveal their identity. \u201cPull over here. It\u2019s you. You are in trouble for driving an Uber,\u201d the passenger tells his driver, during one of a few recent encounters captured in video and circulated online in Hong Kong. The passengers aren\u2019t traffic cops. They are vigilante taxi drivers taking direct action, having become increasingly frustrated about Hong Kong authorities\u2019 failure to regulate the ride-hailing platform. After the car pulls over, they hand over the driver, often still reeling in shock, to the police officers they have called. \u201cYou may say this is provocative. But without these videos, people may think we inflate the numbers of \u2018white-plate vehicles\u2019 out there,\u201d one of the taxi drivers who took part in a sting operation, and asked to be only identified as Ka Chun, told CNN. \u201cWhite-plate vehicles\u201d is how taxi drivers colloquially refer to Uber. \u201cWe just want the government to enforce the law.\u201d Uber (UBER) remains technically illegal in Hong Kong, which it entered in 2014. But it has thrived under the ambiguous approach of officials keen to project an image of technological modernity. \u201cUber is often framed as innovation, which seems to contribute to the \u2018smart city\u2019 vision \u2013 something that the Hong Kong government has strived to be,\u201d said Oliver Chan, an assistant communications studies professor who specializes in the gig economy at Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Ads for the US-headquartered company are widespread, and its drivers are highly unlikely to face problems with the authorities. Taxi drivers have for years complained about how Uber has flouted local laws, upended the market, and chipped away their already modest earnings. But their recent acts of vigilantism appear to have backfired. Instead of rallying public support, the cabbies were on the receiving end of a backlash, with passengers taking to social media to share their bad experiences of rude taxi drivers, ride rejections and opportunistic charging during heavy rains and the city\u2019s regular summer typhoons. \u201cThey charge arbitrarily and refuse to take passengers. And yet, they have the audacity to go on sting operations,\u201d one person wrote on LIHKG, a popular local internet forum, adding: \u201cShameless people know no bounds.\u201d Others have retaliated by reporting law-breaking taxi drivers to police. Pictures of taxis parking in restricted areas flooded the internet in posts calling for people to report them. WhatsApp groups set up by Uber drivers also discuss how to retaliate, one driver told CNN. So tense is the backlash that Hong Kong leader John Lee, when asked about the furor by reporters last week, acknowledged the \u201cfierce public debate\u201d and appealed for calm. He urged taxi drivers to stay away from any vigilante acts. As with New York\u2019s amber-painted medallion taxis and London\u2019s black hackney cabs, Hong Kong\u2019s 15,000 red urban taxis are emblematic of the city. But they are not exactly known for their friendliness or reliable service. Passenger Lau Chi-tim recalled being charged double during a typhoon a few years ago. Drivers often charge a little more because their insurance does not cover extreme weather conditions. But Lau said: \u201cThe trip lasted only 15 minutes and most of the journey was inside a tunnel anyway. Where is the risk?\u201d Another passenger lamented how selective taxi drivers can be. \u201cPeople with pets, a pram, wanting to cross the harbor, or going anywhere that may be crowded\u2026 they just reject you,\u201d Jason Chan said. Similar complaints abound, despite refusal to take passengers being an offense under the Hong Kong law. Those who prefer Uber see it as an alternative to the poor service they have long tolerated and would rather pay a little more for a smoother ride. An Uber driver, who gave only his name Mo for fear of being identified by authorities, said passengers told him they preferred Uber drivers\u2019 manners, and quality of driving. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare swerve around on the road because it\u2019s our own vehicle,\u201d he said. But for Ka Chun, the driver who went undercover, it\u2019s about defending their interest and an institution that he and his fellow cabbies invested time and money to be part of. \u201cThey have an impact on us because these white-plate vehicles can take passengers without a taxi license,\u201d he said, speaking of a permit that can cost a fortune in the city where properties, and even parking spaces, are traded as speculative commodities. Hong Kong\u2019s transport authority has issued some 18,000 taxi licenses \u2013 including for non-urban blue and green cabs - and they are currently traded for up to $400,000 (HK$3.2 million) in a free market. Annual insurance for a taxi also costs up to 10 times that for private vehicles. Drivers who don\u2019t own a taxi pay rental of 550 Hong Kong dollars (about $70) for a 12-hour shift, almost a third of what they make on an average day, according to Ka Chun. \u201cUber drivers don\u2019t need any capital whatsoever as they are using their own car to take passengers,\u201d he said. Patrick Tam, secretary general of the Hong Kong Taxi & Public Light Bus Association, acknowledged the complaints against some unruly taxi drivers, and said he supported the police going after them. \u201cThese taxi drivers should face tough punishment. But it doesn\u2019t make vehicles operating without a proper license less of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want fair treatment.\u201d So far, Hong Kong police have said they had not arrested any Uber drivers ensnared in the amateur sting operations. Estyn Chung, general manager of Uber in Hong Kong, noted that the company launched its Uber Taxi service in 2020 to give riders the option to get a taxi on its app. \u201cWe know from elsewhere around the world that taxi and ride-sharing services can thrive alongside each other. Hong Kong is not an exception,\u201d he said. Creating harmony between traditional cabbies and gig-economy drivers can be tricky. And CUHK\u2019s Chan said that, after years of ambiguity, Hong Kong is already playing catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say the extent to which the government wants to promote Uber, and more broadly, ride-hailing platforms at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hong Kong\u2019s ride-hailing regulations lag behind, for example, Singapore.\u201d The city government is expected to unveil a study on online ride-hailing services in July. A spokesman said it is \u201copen-minded\u201d on the apps, though \u201cthey must be in compliance with the relevant law and regulations.\u201d \u201cThe government should require them to get a different driver permit and insurance even if it legalizes their operation,\u201d said Ka Chun. \u201cOtherwise, why should I get a taxi license? I could drive white-plate vehicles.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_20_style_park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli", "text": "Everyone knows the familiar shapes that make up New York\u2019s skyline. There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_russia-evan-gershkovich-court-trial-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, will stand trial in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg after prosecutors formally accused him of spying for the CIA. The Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s office said Thursday it had approved the indictment, more than a year after Gershkovich was first detained. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Gershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have vehemently denied the charges against him. Less than two weeks after his arrest, Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, which called for his immediate release. Russian prosecutors said the country\u2019s federal security service (FSB) had \u201cestablished and documented\u201d that Gershkovich was acting on CIA instructions in the month he was arrested, alleging he had \u201ccollected secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. \u201cGershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d it said in a statement. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday said the allegations against Gershkovich have \u201cabsolutely zero credibility.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime. The charges against him are false, and the Russian government knows that they\u2019re false. He should be released immediately,\u201d Miller said at a State Department briefing. In the year since his arrest, the 32-year-old journalist has been imprisoned in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times. On Thursday, the State Department\u2019s top hostage official confirmed \u201cas of today, Evan\u2019s detention and the investigative process has ended.\u201d Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said Gershkovich was likely to be moved from Lefortovo to Yekaterinburg \u2013 more than 800 miles away \u2013before the end of June, and was then likely to stand trial in that city. \u201cIf it\u2019s anything like what happened to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, there\u2019ll be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won\u2019t have any contact with him,\u201d Carstens explained, referencing other Americans wrongfully detained in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019ll almost be like it\u2019s gone dark, but eventually, an American or I would say, a detainee surfaces in Yekaterinburg and we\u2019ll have a chance to reestablish that connectivity from there,\u201d Carstens said at a congressional hearing. Responding to Thursday\u2019s announcement, WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said Gershkovich is facing a \u201cfalse and baseless\u201d charge. \u201cRussia\u2019s latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime\u2019s smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan\u2019s case is an assault on free press,\u201d Tucker said in a statement. Reporters Without Borders, an international group promoting press freedom, denounced Gershkovich\u2019s indictment. \u201cThe espionage accusations must be abandoned and Evan immediately liberated,\u201d it said in a statement. US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, speaking after Gershkovich\u2019s pre-trial detention was extended in March, said: \u201cEvan\u2019s case is not about evidence, due process, or rule of law. It is about using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\u201d She called on the Kremlin \u201cto let Evan go.\u201d Proposed swaps Miller, the State Department spokesperson, reiterated on Thursday that the US would continue to pursue Gershkovich\u2019s release, as well that of Whelan, a former US marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he and the US deny. \u201cWe put a substantial offer on the table to secure the release of Evan and Paul Whelan some months ago, as we said,\u201d Miller said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re continuing to work to secure their release. We don\u2019t talk about all the details of that publicly.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted earlier in the year that \u201can agreement can be reached\u201d with the United States to release Gershkovich, as he brought up the conviction of a \u201cpatriotic\u201d Russian hitman in Germany. Speaking in a lengthy and at times ponderous interview with American right-wing pundit Tucket Carlson in February, Putin alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\u201d Putin said. Russian government officials\u00a0have\u00a0previously requested\u00a0that Krasikov be released as part of a proposed prisoner swap of notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for US citizens Griner and Whelan\u00a0according to US officials and\u00a0CNN reporting. Griner, a professional basketball player, was freed in a prisoner exchange for Bout while Whelan remains in prison. Speaking to CNN in Berlin to mark the year since Gershkovich\u2019s detention, Polina Ivanova \u2013 one of his closest friends and a reporter at the Financial Times \u2013 said he was doing \u201cremarkably well\u201d and passing most of his time writing letters \u201ctrying to make us feel better.\u201d \u201cWhen you see Putin talk about it in very clear terms that this is what they want to see happen, that they are looking for a deal, it gives you hope that at some point he will be home. He needs to be home,\u201d Ivanova said. In recent years, Russia has detained a number of other Americans. Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was detained in June 2023, Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina was\u00a0arrested in January, and American teacher Marc Fogel\u00a0was arrested in August 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/russia-evan-gershkovich-court-trial-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Malawi Defense Force Aircraft carrying Chilima and others left the capital of Lilongwe at 9:17 a.m. local time (3.17 a.m. ET), the presidential office and cabinet said in a statement. The plane had been scheduled to land at the Mzuzu International Airport, about 380 km (240 miles) to the north of Lilongwe, but did not arrive and is no longer detectable by radar, according to authorities. \u201cAll efforts by aviation authorities to make contact with the aircraft since it went off the radar have failed thus far,\u201d the presidential statement read. \u201cAs such, the commander of the Malawi Defense Force, General Valentino Phiri, has since informed His Excellency Dr. Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera of the incident, and the president has since canceled his scheduled departure for the Bahamas and ordered all regional and national agencies to conduct an immediate search and rescue operation to locate the whereabouts of the aircraft,\u201d the statement added. In an address Monday night, President Chakwera said air traffic control in Mzuzu had advised the aircraft not to attempt a landing due to \u201cpoor visibility\u201d and bad weather, and to return to the capital Lilongwe. Soon after, authorities lost contact with the aircraft, prompting a search and rescue operation, Chakwera said during the live broadcast on state TV channel MBC. Signals from telecommunications towers reported the plane\u2019s last known position to a 10-kilometre (6-mile) radius in a forest reserve, which has since become the area of focus for the search and rescue operation, Chakwera said. Search and rescue operations \u201cwill continue until the plane is found,\u201d he added. \u201cI know this is a heartbreaking situation. I know we are all frightened and concerned. I too am concerned,\u201d Chakwera said. \u201cBut I want to assure you that I am sparing no available resource to find that plane. And I am holding on to every fiber of hope that we will find survivors.\u201d He said Malawi had contacted neighboring countries and the United States, Britain, Norway and the Israeli governments for support in the rescue efforts. The US has offered a military C-12 aircraft to assist in the search, according to a statement from the US embassy in Malawi. \u201cThe U.S. Embassy Lilongwe is deeply concerned by the news that the plane carrying Vice President Saulos Klaus Chilima and nine others went missing yesterday morning,\u201d the statement posted Tuesday on X said. \u201cWe join President Chakwera in his prayers for the well-being of all those on board the Vice President\u2019s plane,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2024_06_12_americas_us-migrants-mexico-election-intl-latam", "text": "Norma regrets ever having called the police. A shop owner and local coordinator for a political party on the outskirts of Mexico City, Norma called authorities in November\u00a0to file a complaint about noise coming from the building next door to her house. The building was being used by a rival political party, she believes. Norma doesn\u2019t know what resulted from the police investigation, but the 35-year-old began receiving intimidating threats. Strange men began to approach her in the street and warn she didn\u2019t have long to live, she said. She tried moving to a relative\u2019s house, but noticed that she was being followed on the way. When that rival party won the municipal elections two weeks ago, Norma decided to leave town, she said, fearing that she would be further targeted. \u201cAfter the vote, it got ugly in my city,\u201d she said. CNN is using only\u00a0her first name due to concerns for her safety. CNN met Norma on a dusty road in southern Arizona, just moments after she and her three children\u00a0\u2013 13, 8 and 2 years old \u2013 climbed across the low fence that separates Mexico from the United States. They are among several migrant families on the border who told CNN\u00a0they were fleeing the fallout of Mexico\u2019s bloody national elections, which saw dozens of political candidates assassinated and hundreds threatened on the campaign trail. All said they hoped for asylum from the US government. And all said they had not heard of a new executive order by US President Joe Biden blocking asylum requests from most people illegally crossing the southern border during periods of high volume. A few miles east along the border, CNN met several more Mexican families who had been sheltering for days in a tent erected by a local humanitarian group. Bottles of water had been left out for them, along with signs warning to wait for Border Patrol agents to show up, rather than attempt to walk any further\u00a0under the hot sun. Some were fleeing general violence, a lack of jobs, kidnapping threats made to their families.\u00a0Two men with a family sitting on the ground in the stifling heat said they too had fled Mexico following the elections. They had received threats for supporting the wrong candidate in their town, one said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for the candidate \u2013 they were forcing us to.\u201d A wave of political killings and threats US officials have been keeping watch for new migration surges this summer. The violence surrounding Mexico\u2019s election this month is just one of many factors pushing some families to try to cross the border. \u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about elections in Mexico or here in the US, it always provokes a level of uncertainty with everyone, generally, but especially in the migrant population,\u201d a Homeland Security official previously told CNN. The June 2 vote was the biggest and most violent\u00a0in Mexico\u2019s history. With 20,000 electoral positions up for grabs, the scale of bloodshed committed by those attempting to influence the vote was massive; at least\u00a034 political candidates assassinated by criminal organizations during the campaign season. A May 28 report by research group Integralia identified 749 victims of political violence in Mexico, including 231 killings. Hundreds of candidates reported being threatened,\u00a0and many dropped out of their races, fearing for their lives. Intimidation was particularly pervasive in local-level elections, experts told CNN, where races could hand the winners broad control over small communities\u2019 police and fiscal resources. \u201cThe violence and threats were being done specifically to have the impact of saying that this party or these people or this group \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 is in control here. To create that environment of fear,\u201d said Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website. Zissis told CNN she was not surprised political violence might be displacing some Mexicans from their homes today, given a broader security crisis in the country, where the\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is one of the highest in the world. Hundreds of people faced threats during the election campaign, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking the candidates themselves, politicians in the parties, officials in the parties, violence against family members of candidates. So you can imagine that the issue of violence in general in Mexico \u2013 which is potentially getting people to leave their communities and flee \u2013 this could overlap with political violence as well,\u201d she said. Even while ballots were being counted, the attacks continued. One mayor, Yolanda S\u00e1nchez Figueroa of Cotija in Michoac\u00e1n state,\u00a0was assassinated the day after the election, while she was walking from a gym back to her house with her bodyguard. Both were\u00a0shot\u00a0dead\u00a0by people in a white van, the state attorney general said in a statement. US-Mexico cooperation on border control Mexico has worked closely with the US to ease\u00a0migratory pressure at the border, with multiple state agencies working to block or redirect asylum-seekers from around the world away from the US-Mexico border. But conditions at home appear to be pushing some Mexican citizens to join the northward flow. Salvador Guerrero, director of the Alaide Foppa Refugee Legal Clinic in Mexico City, said he worries the government\u2019s commitment to serving as a migration buffer for its northern neighbor has siphoned away resources and attention from interior security work. \u201cFor example, the National Guard was created to protect Mexico,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut for each criminal that the National Guard present to a judge, there are 80 migrants that they also present to relocate people\u00a0from the north to the south,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, impunity reigns in Mexico, where in addition to the high homicide rate, more than 100,000 people have gone missing\u00a0with no explanation of their fate. According to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua,\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved in\u00a02022. And while outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s social welfare programs have lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, the erosion of democratic guardrails and institutions under his watch are piling pressure on those who find themselves on the wrong side politically. High on Lopez Obrador\u2019s agenda before he leaves office is a list of reforms, many of which are expected to have a weakening effect on the day-in, day-out work of democratic institutions in the country, pointed out Zissis, the AS/COA editor. These include eliminating proportional representation of legislators, gutting of autonomous regulatory agencies, and direct election of Supreme Court justices. The ruling Morena party says such\u00a0measures are designed to create a more direct democracy, but critics say they will erode\u00a0checks and balances in the government. \u201cThese may seem like tedious questions but they have a real impact on the country\u2019s democracy and the ability of opposition parties to still have a voice,\u201d Zissis said. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum will begin her presidency on October 1. Widely seen as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lopez Obrador, whether she will continue in his footprints on security, border control and government reform are key questions amid historic levels of migration through North America. Sent back with little fanfare To reach Arizona, Norma\u2019s family took a flight to Hermosillo, and then a truck to a frontier town in the scorching Sonoran desert before eventually crossing the border on foot. She said they walked through dry scrub and mesquite trees for about 20 minutes before reaching a ditch filled with the\u00a0abandoned water bottles, diapers, ID cards and clothing \u2013 left\u00a0by the hundreds of migrants who had already reached the land of the free. Her children were protective as Norma stopped to chat with CNN, her 13-year-old worried that\u00a0people in Mexico would see her mother\u2019s picture on television. Even the two-year-old hugged her leg and pulled at her shirt, trying to hurry her along. \u201cMama,\u201d the toddler squeaked. \u201cVamos.\u201d But the tent at the end of the road would be a long walk for little legs. The temperature was 111 degrees Fahrenheit (43.8 Celsius). They would find no food, water, or air conditioning there \u2013 just dozens of other dazed looking families sprawled on the floor, waiting to be apprehended so that they could tell someone why they were there. For most people crossing that border\u00a0illegally\u00a0today, requesting asylum is no longer an option, no matter what their circumstances. US President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0proclamation\u00a0bars migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold of illegal crossings is met. Though asylum seekers can still use a Customs and Border Protection app to request an appointment to present their asylum claim at a port of entry. It\u2019s a controversial measure. Critics argue the change\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough\u00a0in stemming the vast numbers of people entering the country that far exceeds the capacity of US immigration systems. Immigrant\u00a0rights advocates warn closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0endangers\u00a0vulnerable people\u00a0and ultimately makes the\u00a0border\u00a0less safe. Norma and her kids were detained by Border Patrol on Friday after entering the US.\u00a0By Monday, they had been deported to Mexico, where she says they are afraid to leave the house, and her kids are not going to school. They were treated with respect by the US agents, she told CNN, who swabbed them for DNA \u2013 likely to ensure that the children were really hers. But she never got a chance to explain what she was running from, she said. \u201cThey just said that wasn\u2019t an option,\u201d she told CNN on Monday, speaking on the phone from her home in Mexico.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_08_americas_edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-profile-intl-latam", "text": "Restraint is a rare quality for a politician, especially in Venezuela, a country whose recent leaders have been synonymous with vitriolic populism. Hugo Chavez, the late president who still casts a formidable shadow across the country more than ten years after his death, used to speak for hours on his television show,\u00a0Hello President!, while his firebrand successor, incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, is equally capable of clocking 60-plus minutes of uninterrupted oratory when the mood takes him. So it\u2019s telling that the man tasked with challenging Maduro in Venezuela\u2019s presidential election next month is a man of few words. Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the official candidate of a large opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform, has a habit of answering his questions in single sentences, often stopping before the interviewer has the time to think of a follow-up. It\u2019s an unexpected approach from a presidential candidate aiming to drum up voter enthusiasm in order to take on an authoritarian leader who in the last ten years has dug into power by allegedly rigging elections and\u00a0violating human rights. But Gonzalez is not your typical Venezuelan politician. After decades in the foreign service (he was an ambassador to Algeria and Argentina) and then as a back bench manager for Venezuela\u2019s opposition, Gonzalez was only selected as a coalition candidate because two other opposition leaders \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 had been barred from running and a deadline was looming. \u201cI never imagined I would find myself in this situation,\u201d he told Venezuelan media in late April, shortly after his candidature was formalized. Yet since then, his poise and calm have helped him build a comfortable lead against Maduro, according to recent polls. Opposition, a dangerous business Challenging Maduro\u2019s near total grip on power can be a dangerous business. Over the years, he has jailed or exiled dozens of opposition leaders, some of them for years. And hundreds of people have been killed in political violence in Venezuela in the past decade, often at the hands of state security forces. But most analysts agree Gonzalez represents the best chance that Venezuela\u2019s political opposition has had to dislodge Maduro from power since 2013. His name is already on the ballot for the July 28 presidential vote, and the government has so far shown little appetite for going after him. In October, the Maduro government and the opposition, along with representatives from the United States, signed a comprehensive agreement in Barbados where Maduro pledged to hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief from Washington. Since then, there have been mixed signals on both sides about the extent of the deal: US-imposed oil sanctions have only partially been lifted and most of Maduro\u2019s close circle is still subject to individual sanctions, while on May 28, Caracas withdrew an invitation for the European Union to send electoral observers to monitor the upcoming vote. Gonzalez claims he\u2019s not worried about possible persecution, telling CNN En Espa\u00f1ol that he is \u201cvery calm, confident although aware of the enormous challenge\u201d the opposition is up against. Asked about the prospect of a repeat of the 2018 election, which Maduro won amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging and a boycott by the opposition, Gonzalez says he hopes pressure from other countries will force Maduro\u2019s hand. Most experts say the international community is unlikely to intervene in Venezuela again after the debacle of the 2019 opposition uprising led by Juan Guaido, the then-opposition leader who swore himself in as interim president and was recognized by more than fifty countries \u2013 only for Maduro to retain power and ride out the storm unscathed. But Gonzalez seems buoyant nonetheless. \u201cFraud, vote rigging, and threats are nothing new for us,\u201d Gonzalez told CNN En Espa\u00f1ol, \u201cBut we\u2019re confident that on the day the opposition vote will be so massive our victory will be indisputable.\u201d His family is not so tranquil. \u201cWe are worried, no doubt,\u201d Gonzalez\u2019s daughter Mariana told CNN. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to live one day at a time, because if we start thinking of what could happen, this or that, we stop moving,\u201d she said. The biggest question But how to convince an authoritarian government entrenched in power for decades to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition? Gonzalez has never offered an answer to the question that hangs the July vote. Instead of detailing a roadmap to democracy, he has only hinted at what steps he would take should he win in July and the electoral authority effectively certify the result. He said his biggest priorities would be\u00a0taming\u00a0inflation, another of Venezuela\u2019s chronic ills\u00a0and\u00a0currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in\u00a0the\u00a0institutions of power\u00a0such as the judiciary, currently stacked by Maduro\u2019s sympathizers. The fate of the incumbent and his closest allies \u2013 several of whom are under investigation in the Hague for crimes against humanity \u2013 remain in the balance. But amnesty for outgoing officials could be on the table, Gonzalez told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIn all political transitions and political crises, you have amnesty agreements and transitional justice. All the countries who have gone through situations like ours have ended up granting it, so I don\u2019t rule out we could take a similar measure in Venezuela,\u201d he said. While the election is slated for late July, Venezuela law mandates that the winning candidate won\u2019t take office before January 2025 \u2013 creating a delicate 6-month handover period that Gonzalez would have to manage carefully if he wins. \u201cThose six months will be key for him as a president-elect, while the entire state apparatus remains under the control of the regime,\u201d said Sadio Garavini di Tullio, a classmate of Gonzalez who also served in the foreign office and helped manage the opposition in the Chavez years. \u201cEdmundo however can be that person; he can give a lot of guarantees to everyone involved with the regime.\u201d \u201cHe will not be the president of the opposition government, he\u2019ll be the president of the transition government,\u201d Garavini di Tullio said. George Eickhoff, a German diplomat who served as director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Caracas between 2008 and 2013 and remains close to Gonzalez, made a similar point. \u201cEdmundo is a public servant, he knows there cannot be any revenge [against the government],\u201d Eickhoff told CNN. \u201cHe has already started to speak to the other side: for the opposition, Machado is the firebrand messenger to galvanize its base, while Edmundo is an extension of the soft message, he\u2019s very realistic about his task.\u201d Asked about the possibility of vote-rigging by the Maduro regime, Gonzalez was sanguine. \u201cWe\u2019re aware we\u2019re facing an enemy,\u201d he began \u2013 then corrected himself, softening the message: \u201cAn adversary that has no qualms about using any advantage the system gives them.\u201d Grandfather figure The dual message has been visible throughout this first month of the political campaigning period, with Machado, a long-time conservative politician who first ran for president in 2012, holding public rallies in every street, while Gonzalez has dispensed calmness from his home in Caracas. When Gonzalez\u2019s candidature was formalized in April, a portrait of him by Bloomberg photographer Gaby Oraa went viral in Venezuela. It shows the candidate feeding four colorful tropical parrots called\u00a0guacamayas, typical of Caracas. Across the city, citizens routinely feed these wild birds who can display a pet-like loyalty. \u201cThey come every day, two, three, four\u2026 sometimes even ten. They are his friends,\u201d said Mariana, Gonzalez\u2019s daughter. \u201cThe\u00a0guacamayas\u00a0come in the morning and in the evening, he can spend hours just feeding them sunflower seeds. He takes care of them.\u201d His other passions, according to those who know him well, are baseball, the Real Madrid football club, family barbecues, and reading. Fans see in him a grandfather-of-the-nation type figure who could usher in a new era after the political violence of the last decade, pointing to his electoral slogan \u201cEdmundo, president for all\u201d, as well as his age (73) and family situation (he has four grandchildren). Two of those grandchildren now live in Spain, among the more than seven million Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years. He hopes that an opposition victory in July would encourage at least some of that diaspora to return. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the big Venezuelan family to come together once more,\u201d he told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIt\u2019s time that the adversary is respected as such, and not seen as an enemy,\u201d he added.

For much of the war,\u00a0Ukraine has been constrained when it comes to using powerful Western weapons against Russia. Kyiv\u2019s allies have\u00a0long\u00a0been adamant that their fighting machines\u00a0must\u00a0not strike within Russian territory for fear of provoking Moscow,\u00a0limiting their use to targets within Ukraine, including in occupied areas. But that changed in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive. First, European countries including France and Germany allowed Ukraine to strike targets within Russia, then, most significantly, the US gave the go ahead for Ukraine to use its weaponry around Kharkiv. \u201cOur policy using long-range strike weaponry to go into Russia hasn\u2019t changed, but what we have done is provide Ukraine the ability to counterfire, to fire back at those Russian troops that are firing at them and to be able to take out their artillery batteries as they\u2019re firing at the Ukrainians and I think that\u2019s going to prove to be very, very helpful to Ukraine going forward,\u201d Secretary of Defense Lloyd\u00a0Austin told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. The US HIMARS system has become the go-to weapon system to hit the Russian positions, according to Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence. Due to the threat of being hit by HIMARS, the Russians have begun to use S-300 and S-400 missile systems much less to fire at the Kharkiv region but glide bombs remain an issue. These are dropped from so high they are out of range of Ukrainian defenses. \u201cUnfortunately, we do not yet have permission to hit Russian aircraft at airfields with American weapons and we do not have permission to use ATACMS missiles on Russian territory,\u201d\u00a0said Cherniev,\u00a0referring to a long-range missile system.\u00a0\u201cBecause of this, we have not yet been able to resolve the problem of glide bomb strikes on our territory. Kharkiv and other border areas are still suffering from bombing attacks, and a lot of civilians die.\u201d While the Russian advance has slowed as assessed by the US and Ukraine, Moscow\u2019s forces continue to press along the new front line\u00a0in the north. Russians are focusing on trying to push through the village of Hlyboke north of Kharkiv. If Russian forces manage to take hold there they could push through to the village of Lyptsi which sits 30 kilometers north of Kharkiv \u2013 bringing the city with historic, cultural and industrial importance within artillery range. Northeast of Kharkiv, Russian forces continue to maintain a foothold in the town of\u00a0Vovchansk. The fighting has turned to close combat, with units fighting street by street, according to Nazar Voloshyn,\u00a0a Ukrainian military spokesman in the east.\u00a0But\u00a0\u201cmost of the city is under the control of the Ukrainian Defense Forces\u201d Voloshyn told CNN. \u201cTo disperse the forces and means of our defense forces, the enemy launched an additional Kharkiv campaign\u2026 they partially succeeded, but the defense forces stabilized the situation,\u201d said Yurii Fedorenko, a company commander with the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade currently fighting in the Kharkiv region. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recorded a \u201csignificant increase\u201d (31%) in civilians killed in Ukraine in May compared to April. According to HRMMU, more than half of the casualties occurred in the new northern front and because of \u201cair-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas such as communities near the front line and Kharkiv city.\u201d To counter the Russians\u00a0in Kharkiv, Ukraine has to\u00a0divert men and arms\u00a0from other parts of the front line in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A main goal for Russia has been to exert complete control over the two eastern regions. And that\u2019s exactly where Russia has been pressing quite actively, according to Voloshyn. In the east, Moscow had set its sites on on the town of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. Russian troops have made some advances. Further south along the eastern front line, Russians have made advances to the west of the city of Avdiivka which fell to Russian forces in February. \u201cThe Russian army is trying to do everything possible on the front line before the arrival of US aid to Ukraine and is trying to use this window of opportunity in all possible ways,\u201d according to Voloshyn. Russians are trying to seize the momentum as the weather and daylight hours make conditions more conducive to ground operations. They are also in race against the clock before more arms arrive from Ukrainian partners, particularly as the West is slowly coming around to allowing Ukraine to use the weapons on Russian territory. NATO F16s are expected to arrive shortly and France has pledged to equip Ukraine wih its Mirage\u00a02000-5 fighter jets. Western weapons and a new push to draft more soldiers in to the Ukrainian military could give Ukraine the boost it needs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/europe/ukraine-stabilizes-north-pressure-east-russia-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_armenia-withdraw-russia-alliance-azerbaijan-intl", "text": "Armenia will leave a Russia-led military alliance, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan confirmed Wednesday, accusing members of the bloc of plotting with bitter rival Azerbaijan to start a war against them. Pashinyan has for months accused the Kremlin\u2019s Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) of failing to protect Armenia from resurgent Azerbaijani aggression, threatening to leave the bloc if Moscow did not provide greater assurances and trying to cleave more closely to the United States and European Union. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought two wars over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, which Azerbaijan reclaimed in full by force in September. Russia has traditionally allied with Armenia, but their relations have soured in recent months while Moscow\u2019s ties to Azerbaijan have deepened. Speaking to parliamentarians in the capital Yerevan, Pashinyan said his country had \u201cfrozen\u201d its participation in the CSTO and would leave the bloc at a time of Armenia\u2019s choosing. \u201cWe will decide when we leave, but we will not go back,\u201d Pashinyan was quoted in state media Armenpress as saying. \u201cIt turned out that members of the alliance are not fulfilling their contractual obligations, but are planning a war with Azerbaijan against us.\u201d Pashinyan stopped short of naming the accused countries in the bloc, which includes Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and was founded in 1992 as the Soviet Union crumbled. The rupture in Armenia\u2019s relations with Russia comes after Azerbaijan retook Nagorno-Karabakh in a one-day war in September, sparking an exodus of virtually all of the Caucasian enclave\u2019s ethnic Armenian population, despite the presence there of Russian peacekeepers. Several Karabakh Armenians told CNN at the time that they felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by Russian peacekeepers who \u201cdid nothing\u201d to protect them, leaving them no choice but to abandon their homes and flee to Armenia proper. As more than 100,000 people took to the only road out of Karabakh, a billboard displaying the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin watched down over them. Some 2,000 Russian peacekeepers had deployed to Karabakh after a 44-day war in 2020, when Azerbaijan retook about a third of the enclave, in an offensive halted only by a Moscow-brokered ceasefire \u2013 which Azerbaijan would eventually breach three years later. When Russia\u2019s security guarantees proved hollow and Western support no more than rhetorical, Pashinyan \u2013 fearing an all-out war with Azerbaijan \u2013 declined to send Armenian military support to Karabakh, leaving the enclave\u2019s troops vastly outnumbered and with little choice but to surrender swiftly. Azerbaijan\u2019s President Ilham Aliyev had described retaking Karabakh as the \u201csacred goal\u201d of his presidency. Despite international condemnation of the exodus of Karabakh Armenians, which officials in Yerevan said amounted to ethnic cleansing, there was hope that this was the tragic price of putting an end to one of the world\u2019s most protracted conflicts. But a formal peace treaty has not been signed despite months of negotiations. In April, however, Armenia agreed to return four border villages to Azerbaijan, which both countries described as a major step toward a peace deal. Buoyed by recent progress, Pashinyan said Wednesday that Armenia is \u201cready to sign a peace agreement within a month,\u201d describing the terms of the deal as \u201cfully developed and ready to be finalized.\u201d But attempting to normalizing ties with Azerbaijan has stoked discontent at home, as protesters have accused Pashinyan of making unacceptable land concessions to Aliyev. Azerbaijan has also demanded that Armenia change its constitution to remove a reference to Karabakh independence, but Pashinyan has so far resisted the calls. In scenes reminiscent of those that propelled Pashinyan to power in 2018, protests erupted outside the parliament in Yerevan on Wednesday. Videos showed police using stun grenades to repel the crowds. More than 100 police officers and civilians were injured, Armenpress reported. The protests have been spearheaded by Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, who has for months called for Pashinyan\u2019s resignation. \u201cThe problem is very simple: this man must leave, there is no other option,\u201d Galstanyan wrote Wednesday on social media. While Pashinyan has not yet specified when Armenia will leave the CSTO, the last of the Russian peacekeepers who had been deployed to Karabakh completed their withdrawal on Wednesday, Azerbaijan\u2019s defense ministry said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/armenia-withdraw-russia-alliance-azerbaijan-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_analysis-yahya-sinwar-hamas-ceasefire-talks-intl-latam", "text": "Yahya Sinwar has so far survived eight months of Israeli\u2019s brutal military campaign to kill him.\u00a0His longevity\u00a0is a personal victory for the Hamas leader \u2013 and increasingly appears to be grim vindication of his decision to seize the initiative in the generational Palestinian struggle with Israel\u00a0by\u00a0launching a bloody attack\u00a0on October 7 that would plunge Gaza\u2019s two million residents into a predictable hell. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and his military responded\u00a0as expected\u00a0to Sinwar\u2019s\u00a0onslaught\u00a0of terror\u00a0that killed more than 1,200\u00a0people and saw over 220 taken hostage, declaring war and vowing to destroy Hamas. Predictably too, according to many regional diplomats,\u00a0Israel\u2019s military campaign is\u00a0failing to deliver\u00a0on the dismantling of Hamas, even as the number of Palestinians killed soars past 36,000. While Hamas is people and structures, they argue, it is also an ideology. Now\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0\u2013 who speaks fluent Hebrew and has a nuanced knowledge of Israeli politics \u2013 believes he still has the war\u2019s initiative,\u00a0amid high-stakes bargaining with Israel for a ceasefire and hostage deal. \u201cWe have the Israelis right where we want them,\u201d\u00a0he is said to have told other Hamas leaders, in leaked messages reported by The Wall Street Journal. He appeared to justify the deaths of Palestinian civilians as a \u201cnecessary sacrifice\u201d according to the messages. If this were a conventional war, it would be easy to write Sinwar off as deluded; Israel has the upper hand by far in conventional weapons. But\u00a0the weapons\u2019\u00a0devastating effectiveness is becoming\u00a0a liability\u00a0in this asymmetric conflict, and against the backdrop of a\u00a0tortured history\u00a0that\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0is\u00a0adroitly weaponizing against Israel. Because of the enormous civilian casualties and suffering inflicted by Israel in its pursuit of Hamas, Netanyahu now faces a possible arrest warrant for war crimes from the ICC, the world\u2019s top court\u00a0\u2013 just like\u00a0Sinwar.\u00a0And\u00a0the consequences for Netanyahu are far more serious than for Hamas\u2019 leader, because Sinwar is already a renowned terrorist hiding in a tunnel with limited prospects and Netanyahu is a global leader whose world will dramatically shrink if the ICC issues warrants. Netanyahu dismisses the ICC as anti-Semitic, but\u00a0that hasn\u2019t neutralized the damage in the court of international opinion.\u00a0Meanwhile,\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0can sit back and cash in\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0international\u00a0anger\u00a0over\u00a0Palestinian suffering. Wind in Sinwar\u2019s sails Earlier this year,\u00a0university campuses\u00a0across the United States and Europe\u00a0combusted in spontaneous protest over\u00a0the toll of Israel\u2019s war on\u00a0civilians\u00a0in Gaza,\u00a0where humanitarians warn of a growing hunger crisis. For the first time, a generation of Palestinian were able to witness what they\u2019d always hoped for, a potent political\u00a0force\u00a0able to rival what they\u2019ve always perceived as an over loud, over pervasive and over powerful lobby\u00a0for Israeli interests. In any other year this may have been irrelevant, but Biden\u2019s back is to the wall in the upcoming US presidential election. He\u00a0has pledged unwavering support to Israel and continues to send weapons to Israel\u2019s military, but if he stays the course, Biden\u00a0risks losing vital votes in swing states from a new generation of left-leaning Democrats. He can\u2019t ignore the protesters\u2019 anger about Gaza\u2019s plight. This puts\u00a0wind in Sinwar\u2019s political sails. His negotiating team\u00a0has\u00a0gotten\u00a0tougher:\u00a0first\u00a0appearing\u00a0to be on\u00a0the verge of compromise, then holding out for a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. He also appears to have brought the reality of a Palestinian state closer too \u2013 a\u00a0political\u00a0coup following decades of stultifying inertia. US regional allies, notably Saudi Arabia, have set an \u201cirreversible\u201d path to a two-state solution as part of their price for buy-in to help Gaza rebuild. And while Netanyahu\u2019s far-right ministers predictably say no\u00a0to Palestinian statehood, some\u00a0Western\u00a0partners are\u00a0showing\u00a0they\u2019re fed up\u00a0with Israeli intransigence. In recent weeks, Ireland, Spain, Norway and Portugal, all frustrated Netanyahu won\u2019t agree a peace deal, have\u00a0formally\u00a0recognized Palestinian\u00a0statehood.\u00a0The statements\u00a0mark a remarkable departure\u00a0from\u00a0their previously cautious approach to Netanyahu\u2019s belligerence. Israel\u00a0has lashed out\u00a0against the four\u00a0European nations, but this doesn\u2019t sting Sinwar. He is able to hunker down deep below Gaza and relish the hell he has unleashed above and the repercussions he gambled on. Hamas\u2019s ideology thrives under the\u00a0current\u00a0Israeli attacks, precisely because it was born of, and nurtured on, that very\u00a0narrative.\u00a0The war\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0started\u00a0has taken\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0suffering to the next level\u00a0\u2013 and Netanyahu has played right into it. None of this means Sinwar will be winning a popular vote in Gaza during his lifetime, however long or short that may be. But the\u00a0enormous\u00a0bloodshed he precipitated has allowed him to tap into global moral outrage. He is\u00a0now\u00a0playing the Democratic world against itself,\u00a0and\u00a0his tools are the very\u00a0values\u00a0that\u00a0developed nations hold sacrosanct: sanctity of life and fair play. From a position of apparent weakness, he tries to turn every apparent disadvantage to advantage. On the cusp of Israel\u2019s imminent Rafah operation, he tried to stall it by claiming to accept an Egyptian peace deal\u00a0that\u00a0he said Israel had accepted \u2013 with his officials briefing details of the mechanics and timings of how hostage releases would work. As expected,\u00a0the tactic\u00a0spun up already febrile Israeli street protest against Netanyahu to a new level. Demonstrators demanded Netanyahu forestall the Rafah operation in favor of a seemingly tantalizingly close hostage release deal. Who\u2019s calling the shots in Gaza According to regional diplomats,\u00a0many\u00a0of Sinwar\u2019s power plays were entirely predictable. Decades of Israeli failure to address Palestinians\u2019 security and economic concerns outside of Israel\u2019s perceived interests set the table for Sinwar\u2019s challenge, and what he could expect to achieve. Sinwar\u2019s\u00a0power\u00a0amid the war\u00a0seems to be becoming part of the perceived wisdom about Gaza and the war. In Israel on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone other than the Hamas leadership in Gaza actually are the ones who can make decisions.\u201d Even if Sinwar were\u00a0inclined\u00a0to solicit input from Hamas\u2019s well-heeled leadership cadre sitting in the comfort of Doha,\u00a0and\u00a0meeting leaders in Iran and Turkey, the likelihood they can bridge the gaps in their thinking\u00a0through\u00a0detailed discussion is almost nil.\u00a0Unfettered communication away from Israel\u2019s prying ears and eyes\u00a0is\u00a0impossible. In the final days before Northern Ireland\u2019s momentous 1998 Good Friday Peace Agreement between the IRA\u2019s political wing Sinn\u00a0Fein and the British government, I watched the group\u2019s top leaders emerge from the talks locked in intense, semi-silent conspiratorial whispers, slowly pacing adjacent gardens. But such conversations are likely a luxury Sinwar neither has, nor dares risk taking,\u00a0from wherever he is hiding in Gaza. And\u00a0like any leader convinced he is proving his point, he is unlikely to back down now\u00a0unless his key demands are locked in. His recent warning\u00a0that\u00a0Israel will have to fight for Rafah strongly suggest he is still in the process of bargaining. Blinken didn\u2019t mention Sinwar by name in his remarks Tuesday, but there was no need. Everyone in the room understood who he meant when he added, \u201cThat is what we are waiting on.\u201d And if messages of pressure to make a deal are reaching Sinwar he will also understand them for\u00a0another part of what they are \u2013 an\u00a0attempt\u00a0to turn Gazans\u00a0desperate for an end to the conflict\u00a0against him. As much as Sinwar has put the psychological screws on Israel\u2019s\u00a0leadership, he can be made vulnerable too.\u00a0And if\u00a0past experience is any measure, he will likely gamble\u00a0that\u00a0he can play mind games better than Netanyahu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/analysis-yahya-sinwar-hamas-ceasefire-talks-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_europe_jordan-bardella-france-far-right-profile-intl", "text": "At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has led the French far right to a landslide victory and humiliated\u00a0President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u2019s camp in the European Parliament elections. He\u2019s poised to become the next prime minister if the French president loses his gamble in the upcoming\u00a0snap election. But who is\u00a0far-right doyenne\u00a0Marine Le Pen\u2019s slick prot\u00e9g\u00e9? Bardella, the National Rally party leader, grew up\u00a0an only child\u00a0in social housing in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb in the northeast of Paris. He joined the far-right party at 16 and then briefly attended the prestigious Sorbonne university\u00a0in the French capital\u00a0before dropping out. \u201cLike many families, many people who live in these neighborhoods, I was confronted with violence, and my mother struggled to make ends meet. The truth is that the sense of urgency that led me into politics has never left me,\u201d Bardella told\u00a0public television channel\u00a0France 2 in April. In\u00a0clinching 31% of the vote in the European parliamentary election\u00a0\u2013 a record score for the National Rally \u2013 he trounced Macron\u2019s centrist party by a wide margin. \u201cA wind of hope is sweeping across France and it\u2019s only just the beginning,\u201d he said Sunday, as he urged Macron to call a national election \u2013 a bluff the president called, with the first round of voting to take place June 30. Le Pen handpicked the young\u00a0politician to head the party in 2022 \u2013 ending a 50-year-rule by the Le Pen dynasty \u2013 and bring a fresh boost to the French populist right. Hailed as the answer to the National Rally\u2019s attempts to detoxify the party and attract a younger crowd, he helped distance the party from its founder\u00a0and Marine\u2019s father,\u00a095-year-old Holocaust-denier Jean-Marie Le Pen. While Bardella\u00a0continues to try to rid\u00a0the party of its\u00a0antisemitic\u00a0and racist overtones, the populist rhetoric remains\u00a0much\u00a0the same. \u201cWe will act by expelling delinquents, criminals and foreign Islamists who pose a threat to national security,\u201d Bardella said, as he campaigned on promises of limiting free movement of migrants and threats of mass expulsions. Entrenched in the mainstream Bardella\u2019s popularity is proof that what was once unpalatable and reserved to the fringes of French politics is now normalized and entrenched in the mainstream. Voting for the far right is no longer something to be ashamed of in\u00a0much of France. He appeals to the working class, the unemployed and young people in rural areas. On Sunday, 32% of people aged between 18-34 voted for him compared to 5% for the candidate representing Macron\u2019s party, according to an Elabe poll for BFMTV. According to\u00a0political analyst Dominique Moisi, Bardella has\u00a0galvanized a new generation of voters who worry about the future,\u00a0particularly as regards\u00a0jobs and the cost of living, and who believe France has an \u201cidentity crisis.\u201d \u201cThey (the youth) think the\u00a0world is too dangerous and they say we don\u2019t want to be inundated by migrants coming from the Middle East or Africa. We want to be at home,\u201d\u00a0said Moisi. TikTok charm offensive The selfie-taking, clean-shaven Bardella has led a successful charm offensive on TikTok with videos of him\u00a0wine tasting and\u00a0doing shots.\u00a0Even\u00a0something\u00a0as banal as\u00a0him\u00a0eating a\u00a0cereal bar\u00a0racks up thousands of views. His carefully curated social media presence makes him seem familiar and relatable to his 1.5 million followers. He\u2019s known for his videos with brutal put-downs,\u00a0such as\u00a0drinking\u00a0a beer\u00a0with a caption reading \u201cdrinking the tears of Macron fans.\u201d Far-left figurehead Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has accused Bardella of being all bluster and no substance. \u201cWhat does Mr. Bardella want? We don\u2019t know. He says nothing. He\u2019s a good-looking guy, but what\u2019s his program? Throwing immigrants into the sea.\u201d Critics\u00a0also\u00a0point to Bardella\u2019s\u00a0short career and lack of concrete experience as well as his many absences from the European parliament, to which he was first elected in 2019. Despite his inexperience, Bardella\u2019s ability to rally people behind him was evident this week\u00a0when Eric Ciotti, the\u00a0head of The Republicans, France\u2019s traditional right-wing party, announced a surprise coalition with\u00a0the National Rally for the upcoming legislative elections. The move was immediately attacked by senior members of Ciotti\u2019s own party while Marine Le Pen welcomed the announcement calling it \u201ca brave choice.\u201d Effective political match Bardella \u2013 who dated Le Pen\u2019s niece\u00a0\u2013 has said the two politicians\u00a0have a very trusting relationship. \u201cI\u2019m a loyal, well-behaved boy and I\u2019ll always be her first supporter,\u201d he said. Le Pen, a self-described Bardella groupie, has said she\u2019s always been a great admirer of his and that\u00a0he shows great maturity. The 55-year-old has run for president three times since 2012, made it into the final runoff for the past two, and is largely expected to be a candidate in the next presidential election in 2027. The young Bardella\u2019s electoral success in the European elections look set to help boost that\u00a0ambition. These two deeply political animals, one a fixture of French political life, the other an\u00a0up-and-coming disruptor of it, appear to have found in each other a remarkably efficient political match. It\u2019s\u00a0one that threatens to bring a party long considered too far to the right to be electable to power.

The country\u2019s compulsory military service, which requires almost all able-bodied men to serve for 18 months by the time they are 28 years old, enforced a hiatus on one of the world\u2019s most successful contemporary pop acts.

Mim Cheenchanya from Thailand is one of the lucky fans who will hug Jin \u2013 and told CNN she started crying tears of immense joy when she learned she had won in the raffle. \u201cI wish to tell Jin if he comes to Thailand, can he hold a concert for seven days, because I love BTS so much,\u201d Cheenchanya said. As Jin started giving out hugs in the afternoon, videos began flooding social media from ecstatic fans, showing the star quickly hugging each person as they walked across a purple stage in a line. Many can be heard screaming, whooping, and crying. Even those who can\u2019t get hugs are happy to be there. Holly Campbell, who had traveled from Melbourne, Australia, and Ashley Stoudnour, from Florida, told CNN they wouldn\u2019t have missed the festival for anything. They had entered the hug raffle too, but no luck. \u201cEverybody here tried,\u201d Campbell joked, wearing purple \u2013 the band\u2019s color \u2013 from her shiny boots to her lavender cap. Purple has become ubiquitous with BTS since member V described it as a symbol of the band\u2019s long-lasting love and relationship with their fans. Since then, the color has made appearances in many of their live performances, merchandise and branded collaborations. \u201cBTS themselves pour out so much love \u2013 they put love into their music, into their personalities, their fans,\u201d said Stoudnour. Flying thousands of miles across the world to welcome Jin back was just a way for the fans to \u201cgive them love back,\u201d Stoudnor added \u2013 describing him as the \u201ccomedian of the group.\u201d Another fan, Kim Yoon-jeong, said she had cried all night after finding out she didn\u2019t win a coveted seat in the stadium for Jin\u2019s performance, or a hug \u2013 but she was still excited to support him. She showed CNN her artworks \u2013 digitally painted portraits of each BTS member \u2013 and tiny stuffed dolls of them in her bag, including one member dressed in a military uniform. Michelle Pedraza, another fan who flew to Seoul from her home in California and also missed out on winning a hug ticket, showed off her purple-dyed hair for the event. \u201cNo hug, but all of the air that he\u2019s breathing, I\u2019ll be breathing,\u201d she joked, adding she\u2019d probably be crying and screaming once he took to the stage. The festival was already packed in the morning, with various activities and stalls set up \u2013 photo booths, bracelet-making, custom pins, BTS sticker shops and more. Fans queued to enter, with some enjoying snacks under the shade or using umbrellas to evade the boiling heat. BTS have become worldwide superstars since debuting in 2013, earning No. 1 singles in more than 100 countries. They\u2019ve racked up a long list of accolades \u2013 numerous Billboard Music awards, Time magazine\u2019s Entertainer of the Year award in 2020, and multiple titles at the 2021 American Music Awards \u2013 even becoming the first K-Pop act to earn\u00a0a Grammy nomination in 2021. Beyond music, the group\u2019s members are among the world\u2019s most bankable fashion icons \u2013 with what they wear on the red carpet and in music videos closely watched. In 2021, Louis Vuitton named the group brand ambassadors and dressed them in complementary suits for the 64th Grammy Awards the next year. Dior outfitted the band in custom stagewear for their 2019 tour. Individual members have starred in various luxury fashion house campaigns. In the last few years, the hiatus that military service would bring loomed large. Jin was the first in the group to enlist at 30. BTS is expected to reconvene as a group around 2025.
