{"id": "2024_05_14_middleeast_injured-palestinian-mothers-children-qatar-intl-cmd", "text": "Raneem Hijazi remembers how tightly she held her one-year-old son Azzouz before the Israeli airstrike hit. The drone flying over their building in Gaza was getting louder and she had a feeling that something bad was about to happen. \u201cWhatever happens to me, happens to him,\u201d she says of her reasoning in holding him so close to her baby bump. She does not remember the moment of impact, but the memory of the aftermath is imprinted in her brain. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel the strike itself, you just open your eyes and you are under the rubble,\u201d she says. She immediately started feeling around, searching for Azzouz, until her mother-in-law screamed. \u201cShe found him over my belly. She picked him up. His body was in her hands and his head dropped on my belly,\u201d she recalls. Since that moment on October 24, she has been questioning her will to live. She initially asked her family to leave her to die, but they instead went looking for help to dig her out of the destroyed house in Khan Younis. \u201cMy leg wasn\u2019t visible. My arm was only hanging to my body by a small piece of flesh. I tried to rip it apart but I couldn\u2019t, so I rested it over my belly,\u201d she says. By the time she reached the hospital she was presumed dead, she says. Her eight-month pregnancy made doctors look again and they delivered her daughter Mariam by cesarian. \u201cAs she took her first breath, I came back to life. The doctors told me it was a miracle,\u201d she says. Hijazi tells her story in a faint voice lying in a hospital bed in Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. Her left arm was amputated, and both legs sustained extensive damage, requiring bone grafts to repair them. Critical delay Despite the occasional groans of pain, the relatively quiet hallways of the Gaza ward at Hamad Hospital in Doha are starkly different from the overwhelmed medical facilities in Gaza. Behind every door is a story of a miraculous survival tainted by inconsolable loss. Mothers being treated for life-altering injuries can finally begin to process the loss of a child and struggle with their diminished ability to care for their surviving children. \u201cMy daughter is the one that saved me. When I was first injured, I was saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want her. I want my son back,\u2019\u201d Hijazi says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even lift my head. I couldn\u2019t see her, much less take care of her.\u201d\u00a0She hopes that one day her daughter will give her the energy to carry on. Hijazi was evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment a month after her injury. Mariam, almost as old as the war and with the same chubby cheeks as her late brother, is with her grandparents in Egypt. Hijazi has watched Mariam grow up on video calls. She hasn\u2019t held her for over six months. In Doha, she leaves the hospital between surgeries and doctors assure her she will be able to walk again. \u201cI have been working in orthopedics for around 21 years. The kind of injuries, the severity of the injuries, the types of bone loss, and the kind of infections we faced with the Gaza patients are beyond (anything) I\u2019ve seen before,\u201d says Dr. Hasan Abuhejleh, consultant orthopedic surgeon at Hamad Hospital. He has had to tell many patients that their amputations, while necessary to save their lives, could have been avoided if there were more resources available to them in Gaza. More than 4,800 people have been evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment since Israel launched its military offensive in response to the Hamas attacks of October 7, and thousands more in a serious condition are waiting to leave. Israel has denied 42% of the medical evacuation requests made, the United Nations and aid agencies said in an update on May 10. In recent days, they added, \u201cthe closure of Rafah Crossing has abruptly halted all medical evacuations of critically ill and injured patients outside Gaza.\u201d CNN has not yet received a response from Israel\u2019s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to its request for comment on the rejected medical evacuation requests. Delays to medical evacuations have had a huge impact on the cases that come to Abuhejleh\u2019s hospital. Haunting photo The pain reverberates in different frequencies through the hospital rooms. Shaimaa Al-Ghoul messages the CNN team from an isolation room. Like many patients coming out of Gaza, she has a drug-resistant infection picked up in the territory\u2019s struggling hospitals. Al-Ghoul lost her husband and two of her four children in an airstrike in Rafah in February. The family was sleeping in one room when, suddenly, \u201cthe bed was split in half and I fell onto the ground floor,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI heard Hothaifa (her 11-year-old son) pleading for rescuers not to leave him behind. I didn\u2019t hear my husband or Jenan or Mohamed, so I knew they were martyrs,\u201d she says. She was nine months pregnant and believes the shrapnel that hit her belly also killed her unborn son. Abdullah was delivered\u00a0stillborn the following day. Al-Ghoul shares cheerful pictures of her children before the war, followed by a widely -circulated photo of her daughter Jenan\u2019s\u00a0body, lower limbs severed and\u00a0propelled by the blast to dangle from a window by the scarf she wore to bed. She wants to show the horrors of the war and the memories she and others in this ward are haunted by. Her son Hothaifa roams the hospital hallways on crutches. His injured leg is too swollen to bear weight. The laughs that come easily to his 6-year-old sister, Mariam, who wasn\u2019t with the family that night and was evacuated uninjured, seem to be foreign to the muscles of his face. Mariam enters a room which other patients had warned us housed patients with horrific stories of pain and loss. She plays on the beds left empty when some patients go out in their wheelchairs for a breath of fresh air at sunset. Life after loss Inside that room, Shahed Alqutati, 23, has just finished physiotherapy. Her left leg was amputated and the other is encased in an external fixator \u2013 a metal frame holding her smashed bones together. The strike that hit her third-floor apartment in northern Gaza on October 11 threw her and her husband Ali, a 26-year-old university professor, onto the street. Shellshocked, she opened her eyes to find her leg torn and blood everywhere. \u201cMy husband was in front of me. He was also injured. He lost both his legs and his hand. I shouted to him \u2018Ali, Ali.\u2019 He heard me and he also shouted \u2018Shahed.\u2019 He looked at his severed arm and asked me \u2018where is my arm.\u2019\u201d These were the last words they shared. Both were taken to hospital but Ali did not survive. She lost the love of her life and the baby they were about to have. \u201cA week before the war we bought everything for the baby, every clothes, every t-shirt. (sic) Pink, pink, pink. We were very excited,\u201d she recalls. Her daughter Sham was stillborn two days after the strike, two months before she was due. Her suffering didn\u2019t end there. Alqutati was taken to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City for treatment \u2013 and in November endured an Israeli siege that left patients and medical staff without food or water and with dwindling medical supplies. After two weeks, the Israeli military forced her and others out of the hospital. Her father pushed her in a wheelchair along damaged roads. At a checkpoint, she says, Israeli \u201csoldiers shot in the air and told people to go back. Go back where? There is no place to go. We walked and walked for too many hours,\u201d she says. That obstacle added another day to their arduous journey on the streets. By the time they reached Rafah, her wounds were bleeding and infected, Alqutati says, but she was still afraid of entering hospitals struggling to cope with a daily influx of people injured in the conflict. \u201cIf I went to the hospital, I\u2019ll die, not recover or heal,\u201d she says. Her father dressed her wounds away from the hospitals. Treatment came after she was medically evacuated out of Gaza, and with it the time to process the loss. In one of the many videos she shares on social media, her late husband Ali is seen sheepishly smiling when he realizes she\u2019s filming him again, at a university function, from the backseat of a car, as he paces in a shop. \u201cNo one will feel (my) pain. With the people (I am) strong, happy, laughing. But when I am alone, I feel something painful here,\u201d she says pointing to her heart. \u201cI cannot be healed from that,\u201d she says. \u201cThis will stay with me for all my life. Amputation, fractures, burns, nerve problems \u2026 There is no new leg for me. This is something that will not be forgotten. And how can I forget? I lost my beloved one and my baby,\u201d she adds. Despite the different outcome of their pregnancies, Alqutati and Hijazi describe a similar despair that shackles them to the horrors of the war in Gaza. Like many medical evacuees, they are uncertain about their future and where they might end up, and worried about the family members stuck in Gaza. \u201cLife has ended. There is no more joy,\u201d Hijazi says. \u201cI close my eyes and all the memories overwhelm me. I went to the mall and saw the baby formula I used for my son, and I felt I was dying. And it was just baby formula. You can only imagine what happens when I see his picture or videos or his toys or his clothes,\u201d she says. Tears stream down her face when she watches a video she filmed of Azzouz giggling. \u201cThe pain will never go away. It\u2019s things that can\u2019t be forgotten,\u201d she says. \u201cWe give birth only to lose them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/middleeast/injured-palestinian-mothers-children-qatar-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_middleeast_american-medics-trapped-in-gaza-intl", "text": "Dr. Ahlia Kattan should already be back home in California with her three young children. Instead, she\u2019s spending her days and nights at\u00a0Gaza\u2019s\u00a0European Hospital\u00a0on the outskirts of Rafah. Kattan, an anesthesiologist and specialist in critical care, is one of at least 22\u00a0American physicians trapped in Gaza after an Israeli military offensive in Rafah last week shuttered the city\u2019s critical border crossing to Egypt. Rafah had, until then,\u00a0served as the only entry and exit point for foreign aid workers into and out of Gaza. \u201cMy kids have already been texting me today saying, you said Tuesday that you were going to be home,\u201d\u00a0Kattan told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0WHO\u00a0(World Health Organization) is trying to negotiate a safe exit for us. And it\u2019s not happening.\u201d The crossing has been closed since the Israeli military seized it early last week. Israeli and Egyptian officials have so far failed to reach an agreement on reopening it, instead trading blame for its continued closure. Meanwhile, dozens of foreign doctors are stuck in Gaza, while others are unable to get in as humanitarian conditions worsen inside the besieged enclave. FAJR Scientific, the\u00a0United States-based\u00a0nonprofit organization that brought\u00a0Kattan and 16 other physicians to Gaza, is now calling on the US government to help coordinate the team\u2019s safe exit from Gaza.\u00a0They had been due to leave on Monday. \u201cI am asking the\u00a0US government to step in and coordinate with the WHO to protect US citizens trapped in a war zone and bring them home ASAP,\u201d said Mosab Nasser, the organization\u2019s\u00a0chief executive, who is also in Gaza. At least one member of the team requires evacuation on medical grounds, he added. The 17 medics include 12 American citizens, three UK citizens, one Omani and one Egyptian. Kattan and her husband, who is also an anesthesiologist, arrived in Gaza more than two weeks ago, driven by the helplessness they felt watching the suffering in Gaza on\u00a0television\u00a0and knowing they could help. \u201cWe knew that anesthesiologists were needed for the civilians here, the women and the children. And we knew we had something we could offer,\u201d\u00a0said Kattan. \u2018This is what clean looks like in Gaza\u2019 The FAJR Scientific team recorded video diaries of their experiences\u00a0and the conditions they face\u00a0inside the European Hospital exclusively for CNN. In one video, Laura Swoboda, a nurse practitioner and wound specialist from Wisconsin,\u00a0describes\u00a0the buzz of drones overhead. \u201cEven in moments where we feel safe, the war is going on, and there\u2019s the potential for violence to resume,\u201d\u00a0she says. The dangerous conditions aren\u2019t only\u00a0to be found\u00a0outside the hospital. \u201cWe were not aware of how dire the situation is here. There wasn\u2019t soap to wash our hands between infected wounds with maggots. There wasn\u2019t\u00a0sanitizer wipes to wipe down the tables after each patient,\u201d Swoboda told CNN\u00a0in a Zoom interview. \u201cPeople were just coming in, person after person after person. We\u2019re out of gauze to clean the wounds. We\u2019re out of advanced dressings, we went through all of our cleansers, we\u2019re using whatever we can get our hands on at this point.\u201d \u201cThis is what clean looks like in Gaza,\u201d says\u00a0Kattan in\u00a0a\u00a0clip showing the state of an operating room, with plastic overalls strewn atop the operating table. Ahead of an operation to revise the amputations of a quadruple-amputee,\u00a0Kattan details the lack of anesthetics. Picking up a single vial of Propofol,\u00a0she\u00a0describes\u00a0how the\u00a0medics\u00a0were able bring it in with them from the US. No way out FAJR\u00a0Scientific operates under the umbrella\u00a0of WHO which, according to\u00a0FAJR\u00a0Scientific, has been attempting to coordinate an evacuation. At least one other international medical mission is currently at the European\u00a0Hospital, organized by the Palestine American Medical Association. Of the 19 members on the PAMA medical team, 10 are US citizens. The volunteers on the\u00a0FAJR\u00a0Scientific\u00a0mission all knew the risks involved in traveling to a war zone,\u00a0said Kattan,\u00a0but getting stuck in Gaza was not a scenario they had contemplated. Now, she is torn between the desire to get back home to her\u00a0children\u00a0and the guilt she feels\u00a0for\u00a0trying to leave Gaza at a time when the Israeli military could widen its offensive and the need for medical personnel is\u00a0expected\u00a0to rise. \u201cIt\u2019s just missing my kids and waking up in the morning and realizing they\u2019re not next to me. But the harder part is knowing that I get to leave eventually. And I get to go home and be safe. And I know that my kids are safe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve developed a lot of friends here who are the same age as me and have kids my age and they don\u2019t have those securities and those basic necessities.\u201d After\u00a0more than two weeks of\u00a0witnessing the enormous strain on one of\u00a0the last hospitals still in operation in southern Gaza,\u00a0Kattan\u00a0added that\u00a0she and her colleagues only want to leave Gaza\u00a0if they can be replaced by other physicians. \u201cWe are mothers and fathers who want to be home with their families, and sons and daughters, we are physicians here, and we have colleagues and we can\u2019t abandon them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/american-medics-trapped-in-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_blinken-rockin-free-world-scli-intl", "text": "There was no doubting the message from Antony Blinken\u2019s musical debut in Kyiv on Tuesday night. The US secretary of state made a surprise appearance on stage in a bar in Kyiv, as he appeared alongside Ukrainian band 19.99 in a rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World.\u201d Blinken, who played guitar with the punk/jazz band and even joined in on vocals, arrived in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday for a surprise trip, in which he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss battlefield updates and the importance of newly arrived US aid. The visit is the first by a Biden administration official since the long-delayed passage of US supplemental funding to the war-torn country. Perhaps even more of a surprise, however, was his appearance at Barman Dictat on Tuesday evening, a popular underground cocktail bar and music venue just off Kyiv\u2019s main street, Khreshchatyk. The bar, which has heavy metal doors and metal reinforcements along the walls, is popular with war veterans and soldiers on leave. In a personal address from the stage, Blinken said: \u201cThe United States is with you, so much of the world is with you. And they\u2019re fighting, not just for Ukraine but for the free world \u2013 and the free world is with you too.\u201d The venue posted about the unusual performance on its Instagram page, captioning it: \u201cKeep on rocking on a free world! Thanks @secblinken.\u201d The song was released by Neil Young in 1989 \u2013 the year the Berlin Wall fell \u2013 on his album entitled \u201cFreedom.\u201d Although Blinken did not share the footage \u2013 or even reference the event \u2013 on his social media, his profile describes him as a \u201c(very) amateur guitarist.\u201d Blinken is not the first US politician to show off his musical talents in a European music venue. Former President Bill Clinton played saxophone at the Reduta Jazz Club in Prague in 1994, after the fall of the Iron Curtain \u2013 and returned there to play again earlier this year. In an interview with BBC Radio\u2019s\u00a0\u201dToday\u201d\u00a0show on Wednesday morning, Arsen Gorbach, the band\u2019s guitarist, said the choice of song had been made by Blinken. \u201cI think it\u2019s a special song for him,\u201d said Gorbach, who added that he had previously seen videos of the secretary of state playing the rock anthem online. He told the BBC that the band had earlier received a message that suggested they would be playing with Neil Young himself. Gorbach said the band had been \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the rock star did not show up, but he admitted that Blinken was \u201cvery good\u201d and that it felt like they had played together as a band for \u201cmany years.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/europe/blinken-rockin-free-world-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

On Monday, three men appeared in Westminster Magistrates\u2019 court in London charged with national security offenses, including assisting the Hong Kong intelligence service,\u00a0according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police. Chi Leung (Peter) Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, are also accused of foreign interference,\u00a0the statement said, without specifying who the men were allegedly spying on. Relations between Hong Kong and its former colonial ruler Britain have soured in recent years following mass pro-democracy protests in the Chinese city in 2019 and 2020. The British government has criticized Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed crackdown on almost all opposition in the years following the protests, while Hong Kong authorities have bristled at Britain providing a safe haven for pro-democracy leaders sought by the Hong Kong police. On Tuesday, Hong Kong\u00a0Chief Executive John Lee claimed the British charges against thre three men were a \u201cfabrication.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK\u2019s fabrication in the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the Hong Kong government,\u201d Lee\u00a0said,\u00a0referring directly to a statement from the Chinese Embassy in London\u00a0that was also issued in response to the charges. On Monday, the Chinese Embassy statement, strongly condemned what it called the United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cunwarranted accusation against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.\u201d The charges against the three men allege that between December 20, 2023 and May 2, 2024, Yuen, Wai and Trickett agreed to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception that were likely to materially assist a foreign intelligence service, according to PA media. Police also alleged that on May 1, the three forced entry into a UK residential address, according to PA. All three were\u00a0granted\u00a0bail but\u00a0are\u00a0barred from traveling internationally, with District Judge Louisa Cieciora saying they must abide by a nighttime curfew and report weekly to their local police station. Hong Kong leader Lee noted\u00a0in his Tuesday news conference\u00a0that one of the men charged was the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London but did not directly address a question over whether it was involved in surveillance of Hong Kong dissidents in the UK. Lee, the city\u2019s former security chief, said Hong Kong\u2019s Economic and Trade Office exists to facilitate cultural and economic interactions with people and businesses in the UK and that \u201cAny attempt to make unwarranted accusations against the Hong Kong government is unacceptable.\u201d The Metropolitan Police said they had charged the men with assisting the foreign intelligence service under the UK National Security Act. \u201cA number of arrests were made and searches carried out across England as part of this investigation. While led from London, the Counter Terrorism Policing network has been crucial to disrupting this activity and we have worked closely with the Crown Prosecution Service since the start of the investigation,\u201d Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command said in the release.

{"id": "2024_05_07_europe_eden-golan-euroviison-israel-malmo-intl-cmd", "text": "In the seven-decade history of Eurovision, it\u2019s unlikely that a three-word slogan has been repeated so readily by the song contest\u2019s extravagant contestants, tireless organizers or cagey media managers: The world, they insist, can be \u201cUnited by Music.\u201d But Malmo, the Swedish city hosting the kitsch cultural phenomenon this year, is increasingly divided by Eurovision \u2013 and as the contest\u2019s grand final approaches on Saturday, organizers are struggling to keep the controversy over Israel\u2019s participation from taking over the event. Israeli contestant Eden Golan was booed by sections of the crowd during her semi-final and during public dress rehearsals this week, but progressed to Saturday\u2019s showpiece event. Some of her fellow contestants have also expressed concerns about the country\u2019s involvement, while large pro-Palestinian protests have taken place in Malmo to coincide with the first Eurovision live shows. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Golan in a video message for performing in the face of what he called \u201can ugly wave of antisemitism\u201d while still \u201crepresenting the state of Israel with great honor.\u201d The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the contest, has tried desperately to keep the focus of the event on the performers, but critics have called for a boycott of the event over their refusal to exclude Israel, while it conducts its war against Hamas in Gaza. And on Thursday, after Golan was announced as a finalist, the very real prospect of Israel winning the competition emerged \u2013 an outcome that would cause huge headaches for the EBU and give Israel the right to host next year\u2019s event. Israel soars among bookmakers Saturday\u2019s Eurovision final will be watched by more than 150 million people around the world on TV and around 15,000 fans gathered inside the Malmo Arena. But the concert may be only the second-best attended event in the city that evening; a pro-Palestinian protest, calling for Israel\u2019s removal from the contest, is expecting at least 20,000 attendees, and possibly far more. The competition \u2013 which tries desperately to retain its \u201capolitical\u201d tag \u2013 has become the largest cultural event so far to be rocked by the repercussions of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Israel\u2019s military assault has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza since it was launched in response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks on Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Those protesting or boycotting the song contest claim it is \u201cartwashing\u201d the conflict; others defend Israel\u2019s inclusion, insisting the contest should not be dragged into geopolitics. \u201cPolitics does influence the event from time to time,\u201d Paul Jordan, a fan and researcher of the contest who worked in its communications team from 2015 to 2018, told CNN. But this year, \u201cthe presence of Israel has become such a big issue (that) I think it\u2019s going to overshadow the event,\u201d he said. Weeks of simmering tension over the question came to the fore in Malmo this week, ahead of the contest\u2019s semi-finals on Tuesday and Thursday. And they are leading perhaps the tensest three minutes in the contest\u2019s history, when Golan performs live. Thursday\u2019s second semi-final saw Israel secure a place in the final, with the song \u201cHurricane.\u201d And minutes later, she soared to second-place among some bookmakers\u2019 odds for the grand final, after a moment from the Italian broadcast circulated on social media. Italy\u2019s broadcaster, RAI, seemingly revealed the results of its public\u2019s televote during their live show, which national networks are not meant to do. The results showed that Israel had picked up 39% of the Italian public vote in the 16-strong semi-final, winning among Italian voters in a landslide. RAI told CNN the results were published in error due to a \u201ctechnical issue,\u201d and the broadcaster apologized to the EBU, which in turn said it had asked RAI to \u201creview their procedures.\u201d If Israel wins on Saturday, it would have the right to host next year\u2019s contest. The EBU\u2019s director general, Noel Curran, told CNN that in that event, the EBU \u201cwill do what we always do,\u201d sitting down with Israeli broadcaster KAN to plan the logistics. But such an outcome would cause major headaches for the EBU, ensuring that the contest is mired in geopolitics and controversy for another year, and make it difficult to keep fellow broadcasters onside. Ukraine did not host the event after winning in 2022 due to Russia\u2019s invasion, so second-placed finishers the United Kingdom hosted a celebratory edition of the contest on Kyiv\u2019s behalf. The EBU may seek to find such a compromise if Israel\u2019s war with Hamas is ongoing when it plans the event; but it could find it more difficult to find a country willing to host on Israel\u2019s behalf, given the likely backlash from sections of the Eurovision community. An increasingly political song contest It is difficult to pierce the celebratory bubble that surrounds the competition each year. But even among Eurovision\u2019s media-managed contestants, there are some rumblings of discontent this time. \u201cIt is frustrating. I don\u2019t agree with it at all. It doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Bambie Thug, Ireland\u2019s participant, told CNN of extensive rules restricting any form of pro-Palestinian statement during the event. The singer previously released a statement resisting calls to boycott the event, saying they intended instead to provide a \u201cpro-Palestinian voice\u201d in Malmo. They told CNN that Israel\u2019s involvement in the competition was the \u201cwrong decision.\u201d Founded by the EBU in 1956 as a unity-fostering project between national broadcasters, Eurovision has been rocked and buffeted for decades by the continent\u2019s geopolitical currents. It offers an unrivaled soft power-building platform to member states with poor human rights records, like Azerbaijan and, until two years ago, Russia. But this year is the most difficult yet for the EBU, which decided against excluding Israel over the country\u2019s war in Gaza, whereas Russia was barred after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago \u2013 contrasting stances that led to calls of double standards. \u201cThe two are not comparative at all,\u201d Curran, the EBU\u2019s director general, told CNN, insisting that Israel\u2019s national broadcaster KAN did not breach the contest\u2019s rules as Russia\u2019s did, which is the ultimate test of eligibility for the contest. \u201cIf we start across the board just deciding that we\u2019re going to exclude people, on the basis of geopolitical situations or terrible things that might be happening in the world, then every year we\u2019re just going to have groups of people calling for someone to be excluded \u2013 be it Azerbaijan, be it somebody else,\u201d Curran said. \u201cWe want to try and keep the contest as non-political as we can,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s hard.\u201d He may be understating matters. Publicists representing a swathe of Europe\u2019s most eccentric musical artists in Malmo have been especially cautious with their talent, seeking to protect them from questions relating to the protests taking place just a few yards from their hotels. CNN asked to interview Golan, Israel\u2019s performer, for this story, but was told it would only be arranged if CNN provided the questions beforehand, which goes against standard journalistic practices. The EBU was already forced to intervene when Golan\u2019s initial song submission, \u201cOctober Rain,\u201d was deemed to too closely reference Hamas\u2019s October 7 attacks on Israel. And the EBU has worked hard to keep dissent from seeping into Malmo Arena. Long-standing rules preventing flags of non-competing countries and territories mean that Palestinian flags are banned from the crowd, which Bambie Thug told CNN they \u201c100%\u201d disagreed with. Artists are not allowed to make statements either, though some may risk the punishment \u2013 a fine for their broadcaster \u2013 to do so, as Iceland\u2019s act did in 2019, when they held up Palestinian flags during the contest, which was held in Israel. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want them to do that, quite obviously,\u201d Curran said. \u201cThat is not something that we want artists to do, and it\u2019s in the rules that they shouldn\u2019t do that, and can\u2019t do that.\u201d When asked by CNN, the EBU did not rule out adjusting sound levels on the broadcast to obscure booing, if it occurs during the Israeli performance. But, for all their efforts, Eurovision bosses will hold their breaths while Golan sings in Saturday\u2019s grand final. \u201cThe real worry would be any threat of violence, particularly towards the singers,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThe worst nightmare could be a stage invasion.\u201d The latter occurred during the United Kingdom\u2019s performance in 2018, when a man snatched the microphone from singer SuRie and screamed a message before being removed. \u2018It has divided the city\u2019 As Malmo sought to stage a week\u2019s worth of events and performances to celebrate Eurovision, it encountered a problem: artists kept dropping out, following pressure from pro-Palestinian groups urging a boycott of the contest. \u201cIt has divided the city, in a way,\u201d admitted Karin Karlsson, who is in charge of staging the events in Malmo. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will solve any questions when it comes to the war in Gaza by boycotting,\u201d she said. In total, she said 20 artists had dropped out of performing in the city. But Karlsson is undeterred. \u201cI sleep well,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to show everybody a vibrant, super diverse city, where we can live side by side but still think differently.\u201d She hopes that Malmo is on track to fulfilling that goal. \u201cBut you never know. It\u2019s uncertain at the moment.\u201d Her efforts may have been complicated by the choice of host. \u201c(Malmo) has this history of resistance and solidarity, and it\u2019s a working class city, but at the same time the municipality has tried to rebrand Malmo as a more global city,\u201d Elina Pahnke, a Malmo-based journalist covering culture for the Aftonbladet newspaper, told CNN. That has caused tensions with some residents, she said, who want resources and time spent on public services, rather than international spectacles. The city is also home to large Muslim and Palestinian populations. Weekly pro-Palestinian protests have been held since Israel\u2019s war in Gaza began in October, and the protest during Saturday\u2019s live final could be the biggest since those early weeks. \u201cWe hope to show the EBU that the people of Malmo reject their attempt at artwashing,\u201d said Mohammad Ghannam, who has led the movement to boycott Eurovision as part of Sweden\u2019s Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) group. A massive security operation is in place; a Swedish police spokesperson told CNN it was one of the largest Malmo has ever seen, and involves officers from Denmark and Norway as well as Sweden. And last week, Israel\u2019s National Security Council raised its travel warning to Malmo, urging Israelis planning to attend Eurovision to reconsider whether they need to do so. It cited \u201ctangible concern that terrorists will exploit the protest and the anti-Israel atmosphere to carry out an attack on Israelis,\u201d and described Malmo as a hub for \u201canti-Israel protests.\u201d Lara Yosef, a 30-year-old Syrian migrant to Malmo who will be attending Saturday\u2019s demonstration, said that when she walks past Eurovision advertising in her city, \u201cI see blood.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hoping that some artists will surprise us and (make) some statements on stage,\u201d Yosef said. Amid those tensions, some artists have complained of online harassment and abuse, while others have praised the pro-Palestinian demonstrators. \u201cPower to them for protesting,\u201d Bambie Thug said, before their media manager quickly asked CNN to return to questions centered on their music. But many more are working to block out what is becoming a near-deafening distraction, joining Eurovision\u2019s organizers in offering delicate comments. \u201c(Our) sympathy is (with) all people who say that war is sh*t,\u201d said Ukrainian contestant Alyona Alyona. \u201cBecause who, if not we, can say what is war, and how sh*t it is?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/europe/eden-golan-euroviison-israel-malmo-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_middleeast_egypt-warns-israel-dire-repercussions-rafah-operation-mime-intl", "text": "Egypt could consider downgrading relations with Israel if it presses on with a military operation in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah on the Egyptian border, an Egyptian official told CNN. \u201cEverything is possible and is on the table, including the downgrade of the relations. But we are not there yet. We are talking to the Israelis, trying to explain and reach a consensus,\u201d the official said. The official said that coordination between the two countries on the Rafah operation, which Egypt has publicly opposed, \u201cdidn\u2019t go well. And that\u2019s why we warned Israel of dire repercussions.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Israeli foreign ministry for comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Egypt was considering downgrading ties with Israel. The two countries had been at loggerheads this week after Israel began a limited military operation in Rafah last week and seized the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Egypt subsequently refused to coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza with Israel. The official told CNN earlier that aid deliveries to Palestinians could be halted because Egypt can\u2019t guarantee the safety of its trucks, as they may come under attack by Palestinian militants targeting Israeli troops. The top diplomats in both countries traded blame over the closure of the Rafah crossing as aid deliveries through the key land crossing halted. Rafah had been the entry point for nearly a quarter of the relief entering the Gaza Strip before Israel\u2019s operation. On Tuesday, the US State Department warned that only 50 humanitarian aid trucks made it through to Gaza on Sunday, down from hundreds per day in previous weeks, adding that the number is \u201cnot nearly enough.\u201d Israel placed the blame for the crossing\u2019s closure on Egypt. In a statement on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday said he had spoken to UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock \u201cabout the need to persuade Egypt to reopen the Rafah crossing to allow the continued delivery of international humanitarian aid to Gaza.\u201d The Israeli minister\u2019s comments drew backlash from Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, who rejected Katz\u2019 statement, calling it a \u201cpolicy of distorting the facts.\u201d Shoukry stated Egypt\u2019s \u201ccategorical rejection of the policy of distorting the facts and disavowing responsibility followed by the Israeli side,\u201d adding that Katz\u2019s remarks are \u201cdesperate attempts by Israel to hold Egypt responsible for the unprecedented humanitarian crisis facing the Gaza Strip.\u201d The crisis, Shoukry said, \u201cis a direct result of indiscriminate Israeli attacks against the Palestinians for more than seven months.\u201d Israel has said that it will never let Hamas take control of the border crossing. The Egyptian official told CNN that Egypt didn\u2019t want Hamas to be in control either, but that Israeli control is also unacceptable. \u201cIt needs to be in the hands of the Palestinians,\u201d the official said, adding that the crossing could be placed under the control of the Palestinian civil defense. \u201cThese are neither Hamas nor Fatah (a rival party to Hamas).\u201d Israeli troops at the Egyptian border Adding to tensions are Israeli military movements that have seen the Jewish state\u2019s tanks and soldiers operating on Egypt\u2019s doorstep, causing outrage in Egyptian media for alleged violations of the 1979 peace treaty signed between the two countries. Israeli troops have crossed into an area that was demilitarized in that treaty four decades ago \u2013 including parts of a border zone known as the Philadelphi Corridor, where the Rafah crossing lies. Videos released by the Israeli military last week showed Israeli flags raised on the Palestinian side of the frontier. The Philadelphi Corridor is a 14-kilometer (about 8.7 mile) long and 100-meter-wide strip of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt. The corridor is key to the 1979 treaty, a pact that saw Egypt and Israel end their enmity and which restricted the number of troops each side can place near the other\u2019s territory. Changes to the security presence in the area must be made with mutual agreement. Over the years, amendments to security agreements between Egypt and Israel have allowed Cairo to boost its security presence in the Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel. Israel has not disclosed the scale of its military presence in Rafah. But according to the 1979 peace treaty, which was drawn up before Israel unilaterally withdrew troops from Gaza in 2005, Israel is allowed a limited force of four infantry battalions in Zone D \u2013 where the Philadelphi Corridor lies. These battalions may consist of up to 180 armored personnel vehicles and a total of four thousand personnel. The presence of tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft missiles, except individual surface-to-air missiles, isn\u2019t allowed, the treaty says. It is unclear how many troops Israel now has stationed across the border in Rafah. Asked by CNN about the scale of its military operation in the city, and whether it was coordinated with the Egyptians, the IDF declined to comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/middleeast/egypt-warns-israel-dire-repercussions-rafah-operation-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Any of the league\u2019s 20 clubs can put forward a proposal to be voted on.

Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards.\u201d Additionally, Wolves listed a number of issues with VAR which it says are \u201cdamaging the relationship between fans and football\u201d and \u201cundermining the value of the Premier League brand.\u201d These include VAR\u2019s impact on fans celebrating goals, \u201cfrustration and confusion\u201d in stadiums due to lengthy VAR checks, continued errors by officials despite the replay system and the \u201cerosion of authority\u201d for on-field referees.

Firefighters battling more than 100 blazes across the country could see temporary relief in some regions as a large mid-week storm tracks through western and central Canada, bringing increased chances of rain and blasts of cooler air. Even so, several volatile fires are raging within miles of neighborhoods. Fire officials warn slight changes in weather conditions or wind direction could quickly place nearby homes and businesses at risk. More than 6,000 people have evacuated from Fort McMurray in Alberta since Tuesday as a 51,000 acre fire burns less than 5 miles from the city\u2019s edge. Residents should plan to be away from their homes until at least May 21, possibly longer, the regional municipality said. The fire near Fort McMurray was still active Wednesday, but winds were expected to begin pushing the blaze away from the city and its major highway, Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said. Rain showers are forecast to begin in the area Wednesday night and drop up to 1 inch of rain through tomorrow. Around-the-clock firefighting efforts have helped keep the flames at bay, including water helicopters equipped with night vision. Firefighters \u2013 some of them defending their own communities \u2013 have also been pulling grueling and dangerous shifts. \u201cTo the firefighters braving the flames to defend Fort McMurray and other areas of the province, we appreciate your heroic efforts more than we can say and we pray for your safe return,\u201d Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Wednesday. For many Fort McMurray residents, the smoke-blackened skies and anxious evacuations recall painful memories of a catastrophic 2016 fire dubbed \u201cThe Beast,\u201d which forced 90,000 people to evacuate and wrought billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses. Resident Jocelyn Routhier, whose neighborhood has yet to be ordered to evacuate, has watched from her back porch as the scene grows eerily similar to the previous disaster. She shared two uncanny pictures of the fires taken eight years apart. \u201cThis is a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that I would rather not experience. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t turn into a reality,\u201d Routhier said in social media post alongside the images. \u2018It\u2019s hard to think anything but the worst\u2019 New fires are cropping up every day across Canada and several out-of-control blazes are threatening populous neighborhoods, prompting scores of evacuating residents to look for lodging in hotels, emergency shelters and camp and RV sites. Mackenzie Spenrath is among the nearly 5,000 people ordered to evacuate the Fort Nelson area in British Columbia, where the 31,000-acre Parker Lake Fire is burning just 1.5 miles from the community. He told CNN affiliate CBC he has become consumed with watching the news and scrolling social media \u201ctrying to figure out if my town is still standing.\u201d  Fort Nelson fire crews may be aided by under an inch of rain forecast Wednesday night and through Thursday evening. But that is far from the amount of precipitation needed to offset drought conditions and extinguish the fires, the British Columbia Wildfire Service said. \u201cIt\u2019s not entirely hopeless, obviously. But the fire is just so close to town that it\u2019s hard to think anything but the worst,\u201d Spenrath said. Extraordinarily dry conditions are also posing challenges for fire personnel battling a blaze that has come within a mile of the Cranberry Portage community in western Manitoba. About 580 people have been evacuated and there is no estimated time for their return. \u201cBecause the conditions are so extremely dry up there, the fires burned down deep,\u201d Earl Simmons, the director of the Manitoba Wildfire Service, told CBC. \u201cSo the firefighters have to get in there and dig really deep into the ground to put it out. And we\u2019re not just talking a few inches, we\u2019re talking meters into the ground in spots.\u201d The dry conditions driving Canada\u2019s wildfires are aggravated by warming conditions caused by human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada,\u00a0according to Environment Canada.

The typically jovial event \u2013 one of the most watched in the world\u2019s cultural calendar \u2013 descended into turmoil in recent days, as organizers in host country Sweden tried and failed to contain anger aimed towards Israel\u2019s delegation. But Nemo, a favorite throughout the process, won over crowds with a stunning rendition of \u201cThe Code,\u201d a genre-bending anthem about their journey towards accepting their non-binary identity. \u201cI hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person,\u201d Nemo said after accepting the trophy. \u201cI have to say this whole experience was really intense and not just pleasant all the way. There were a lot of things that didn\u2019t seem like it was all about love and unity, and that made me really sad,\u201d Nemo said. Their win \u2013 the first for a non-binary person \u2013 was Switzerland\u2019s first triumph since Celine Dion won in 1988. Malmo hosted the competition on the 50th anniversary of ABBA\u2019s Eurovision breakout, but the event quickly found itself facing political controversy, and tension grew in the hours leading to the final. Protesters said the event was \u201cartwashing\u201d Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians since being launched in the wake of the militant group\u2019s October 7 attacks on Israel. But organizer the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) defended Israel\u2019s presence, and insisted the contest is non-political \u2013 a line that became increasingly untenable as artists, broadcasters and fans clashed over the presence of Israel\u2019s singer Eden Golan. Golan was booed by some members of the crowd during her performance, while a few turned their backs or left the arena, but more attendees cheered the Israeli performance. And outside the arena, police surrounded a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters, keeping them separate from crowds arriving for the event as they chanted \u201cFree, free Palestine!\u201d and \u201cBoycott the Eurovision.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Bambie Thug meanwhile told CNN in the build-up to the event that it was \u201cthe wrong decision\u201d not to exclude Israel, as Russia had been two years ago. Nemo told CNN before the final that Eurovision was \u201ceven bigger and crazier than I expected it to be. There\u2019s so much depth to Eurovision that I didn\u2019t know of before.\u201d \u201cIf I win, I will throw a big party on the lake of my hometown, Biel,\u201d they told CNN. Just hours before the event, it was thrown into added turmoil when the EBU disqualified the Dutch entrant for a backstage incident involving a female crew member. The EBU said police were investigating the incident involving the singer Joost Klein and that it would not be appropriate for him to participate. Some fans made their anger at the decision clear during the final by booing EBU representatives when they appeared onscreen. The Saturday-night showpiece event featured celebrations of ABBA and other Swedish musical stars, and performances from 26 finalists that spanned genre, language and style. Next year\u2019s event will take place in Switzerland, after Nemo\u2019s win. The date and city hosting the contest will be announced in the coming months.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/europe/eurovision-song-contest-winner-switzerland-nemo-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_middleeast_palestinian-young-amputees-us-intl", "text": "Ahed Bseso lay on the kitchen table in her home in northern Gaza, watching as her uncle amputated her injured right leg with a knife. Standing by, her mother cried, \u201cAhed is dead!\u201d But 18-year-old Bseso was very much alive, and she has survived to tell her story, from a hospital in Greenville, South Carolina. Bseso said that on December 19 last year, she went to the top floor of her house in Gaza to get a cellphone signal when an Israeli tank outside fired at her building. It destroyed part of her home\u2019s wall, which came crashing down on her leg, along with heavy debris. With her neighborhood under siege and no possibility of medical attention, her uncle, who used to work as an orthopedic surgeon, used kitchen supplies to amputate her leg below the knee and dress it with unsterilized gauze. The days that followed were horrifically painful. \u201cFor four days, I couldn\u2019t leave the house because the Israelis wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d she told CNN through a translator, at the Shriners Children\u2019s hospital. \u201cThere was no medication I could take to inhibit the pain or to help me with my condition. So, I just sat in agony for four days.\u201d The video of her amputation\u202fwent viral\u202fand caught the attention of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund (PCRF), a US organization that provides free health care to thousands of injured and ill Palestinian children in the Middle East. The organization worked for weeks to evacuate her from northern Gaza and bring her to the United States for medical care, according to Tareq Hailat, head of the Treatment Abroad program at PCRF. She is one of three Palestinians who received PCRF\u2019s help to come to the US for leg injury treatment. At least 1,000 children in Gaza have had one or both legs amputated, UNICEF reported\u202fin December. Though he couldn\u2019t give an exact figure, UNICEF spokesperson Joe English told CNN that the number has since grown. Nearly 26,000 children \u2014 or just over 2% of Gaza\u2019s child population \u2014 were  killed or injured in the Gaza Strip in the first six months of the Israel-Hamas war, according to international nongovernmental organization\u202fSave the Children. From October 7, 2023 \u2014 the date of the Hamas attack on Israel \u2014 to early April, more than 13,800 children were killed and at least 12,009 were injured, the organization said. Avoiding amputations Two-year-old Jood Damo\u2019s\u202fhouse was struck by a tank shell on December 26 last year, killing his mother and fracturing his right leg. His father, Ahmed Damo, who accompanied him to the US, told CNN that the toddler witnessed his mother dying. \u201cTo this day, he still has episodes where he asks about his mom,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, he wakes up in the middle of the night, just crying and screaming, and asking about his mother.\u201d Now, doctors at another hospital in Chicago are assessing whether his injured leg will respond to treatment and grow at the same rate as his left leg. If not, it could significantly delay his path to recovery and treatment plan, PCRF said. Ayham Musalm, 13, said his left leg was fractured and had glass shrapnel lodged in his knee when debris from a strike on a neighbors\u2019 house came straight into his home on December 10. He went months, however, without anyone identifying what was wrong. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to see any physician for a long time,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThen one physician just sewed my wound, and said it wasn\u2019t serious and sent me home.\u201d In the care of Shriners Children\u2019s hospital in Greenville, Musalm has had access to imaging and MRI processes, which helped American experts find the shards of glass inside his knee. That led to surgery and further treatment, and he avoided amputation. He is now in physical therapy. It took PCRF weeks and sometimes months to get children out of Gaza. Besides the time needed to secure their US visas, evacuating the children \u2014\u00a0or even moving them from one part of the strip to the other \u2014\u00a0required Israeli approval, which can be a complicated process, according to Hailat, who works on the evacuations. This delay in treatment for such injuries can result in grave repercussions, said Dr. Amber Alayyan from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders), an international aid NGO. \u201cThe longer they wait without care, the worse it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said. Alayyan, who has traveled in and out of Gaza several times, said the enclave could have handled the care for such injuries before its\u202fhealthcare system was devastated\u202fby the war. \u201cWe see people who, despite their burns, walk into the clinic without a jaw because the healthcare system has completely collapsed and there are no spaces to take care of these people in the hospitals,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were 3,500 beds in the hospitals in Gaza before the war. But there are so many displaced people living, squatting, seeking shelter in hospitals, that there\u2019s not even space for the patients.\u201d \u201cAs a result, the wounds that these patients are suffering from are beginning to literally rot,\u201d she added. \u201cThey smell now.\u201d In these overwhelming conditions, doctors are struggling to identify infections and types of injuries, and the focus is entirely on saving lives. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to carry out these life-saving amputations because you would have had a system that functioned. You would have had reconstructive surgery. Possibly, you would have had immediate lifesaving surgery possible, and they would have been able to save these limbs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now we are doing everything we can just to save lives in the moment.\u201d PCRF\u2019s Hailat said he doesn\u2019t know if Bseso\u2019s injury required an amputation either. But with Gaza under siege, and no immediate medical attention, hospital care, and sterilized equipment available, amputation was the only choice. When she arrived in the United States, the bone in her other leg was also deeply infected. Doctors feared that she may have needed both legs amputated, but with adequate care and treatment, she has avoided that outcome. An anxious wait to return home Evacuating to the United States is not the obvious answer for all injured children, Hailat said. The country has accepted 20 children from Gaza for treatment, but Hailat said he has rerouted 17 of them to other nations. Some injuries are so severe that Hailat said he has to choose medical care as quickly as possible \u2014 which means staying in the region \u2014 over expertise and the advanced level of care in the United States. He also said he wants to ensure that the children who are evacuated to the US need treatment that\u2019s specifically available in the country. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to limit how many people we bring to the United States. We would much rather bring people to local areas and local countries around Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if specific treatment of that particular child is needed to be done in the United States, then we will go out of our way to ensure that happens. Culture is also important for care and recovery, Hailat said. \u201cCulturally, you don\u2019t want to separate them so far away from their homeland that it\u2019s difficult for them to adapt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want them to be close to Gaza. This is a very sensitive time, and I don\u2019t want them to feel as though we are separating them from their country.\u201d Back home, Bseso said her mother fell sick as\u202fmalnourishment has plagued northern Gaza. She worriedly waits for more news and updates from home, and she knows that her family would be trying to make their way to the top of their residential building, to find a cell signal to contact her \u2014 the same ritual that put her in the Israeli line of attack. Her hope is to reunite with them in a safe place. \u201cWe really need our family to be with us together,\u201d she said. Musalm, too, wants his treatment to finish so he can return to Gaza and see his family. But there is no knowing when that may be. After their treatments, which Hailat said will most likely take a year, PCRF will ensure it is safe in Gaza before returning the children there. \u201cWe will not do that if it puts them in danger,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we will have to wait to ensure that Gaza is able to be a safe location for them to return.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/middleeast/palestinian-young-amputees-us-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_middleeast_israel-airstrikes-gaza-hospitals-tuesday-intl", "text": "Hospitals in central Gaza have reported that 40 people were killed in two Israeli airstrikes overnight within a few hundred meters of each other. Al Aqsa hospital said it had received 29 bodies from one strike, nine of whom were children, while Al Awda hospital said it had received 11 bodies after the second strike. The strikes occurred at about 1 a.m. and 2:45 a.m. on Tuesday morning local time (6 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. Monday ET), according to witnesses. Rescue workers have continued efforts to find bodies underneath the rubble of a four-story building in Nuseirat that was demolished in the first strike. Witnesses said dozens of people had been sheltering in the building\u2019s yard. CNN video showed those injured and killed being brought into Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, while other video shows the bodies of several children being retrieved from the wreckage. Desperate family members surround the piles of rubble, waiting to see if anyone is rescued alive, the footage showed. But the workers at the scene clearly lack equipment to remove the concrete. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the two strikes. Some of those killed had recently arrived from Rafah, according to people at the scene. One witness, Ashraf Al Jalees, told CNN at the site: \u201cI swear these are innocent civilians \u2026They are all buried under the ground, including children. There are seven girls here. What fault did they have?\u201d He said he had set up a tent for a friend \u2013 Hassan Obeid \u2013 whom he said had \u201cno affiliation with Hamas or anyone else.\u201d Calling out Obeid\u2019s name, Al Jalees added: \u201cHe stayed to sleep here tonight, and the house collapsed on all of them \u2026 Over 50 people are under this, I swear to God they are all innocent civilians. God will question me one day if I am lying.\u201d Another man, Hamdan Karaja, told CNN: \u201cMy children, both girls and boys, are under the rubble. My wife as well.\u201d Karaja said he had seven children. He said the body of his father had been retrieved. \u201cWe have over 100 displaced individuals, with some comprising 20 family members. They are all trapped under the rubble. We were targeted while we were asleep, without any prior warning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have displaced people\u2019s tents in the yard. We have 10 martyrs here and 20 over there.\u201d Rami Al Aida, a Civil Defense spokesperson in Central Gaza, said crews were \u201coperating in extremely challenging conditions due to a lack of fuel and equipment. We hope to find people alive. We appeal to all international organizations to provide the Civil Defense with the necessary tools, bulldozers, and fuel.\u201d Al Aida agreed with the assessment of others at the site that dozens were still under the rubble. \u201cThere are over four families trapped under the rubble, in addition to the displaced families seeking shelter in and around the building. There are more than 100 people.\u201d A girl who gave her name as Sama Alousha said they had heard a detonation at about 1 a.m. \u201cWe all panicked and came to see what happened. I saw my friend\u2019s house completely destroyed. We are unable to rescue anyone. I have five friends trapped under this place.\u201d One unnamed man said he and his family had been displaced several times. \u201cWe were displaced from Shajaiya. We moved to Khan Younis and then to Rafah, and from Rafah, we came here. My brother rented a place here and stayed there with his family. \u201cSuddenly, I received a call informing me that the place where my brother was staying was hit. There are no tools to retrieve them. They are a family of six, all innocent civilians. My brother, his wife, and four children.\u201d He then called out the names of his brother\u2019s family, but there was no response. One tearful woman at the scene, Um Mahmoud, told CNN: \u201cMy brother arrived from Rafah three days ago after being forcibly displaced, and now we do not know his whereabouts. He, along with his wife and five children, has no connections with anyone. He is simply a displaced person who came from Rafah and was still searching for a place to stay in Deir el Balah. \u201cHis name was on the list of those supposed to leave Gaza through the Rafah border, but fate intervened,\u201d she added. A man called Salah Abu Jarada said his brother had also come from the Rafah area. \u00a0\u201cThey were hit, with three floors collapsing on top of them. They have not been rescued yet.\u201d A second strike occurred at the UNRWA school in Nuseirat about two hours after the first, according to witnesses. Ismail Abu Ghosheh said: \u201cEverything is burnt, and seven people were killed.\u201d Another man at the school, Najah Abu Daher, said: \u201cThere is no safe place to go.

{"id": "2024_05_16_sport_harrison-butker-commencement-speech-analysis-cec", "text": "The NFL is distancing itself from controversial comments by Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker during a recent commencement address. In addition to calling Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin\u201d and bemoaning diversity and equity initiatives, Butker set off waves of criticism when he suggested that women find more fulfillment through getting married and having children than by pursuing careers \u2013 directly after quoting a song by Taylor Swift. The backlash has been building since Butker made the comments Saturday in an address to graduates at Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas. The NFL issued a statement Wednesday, saying Butker\u2019s comments don\u2019t reflect the views of the league. \u201cHarrison Butker gave a speech in his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization,\u201d said Senior Vice President Jonathan Beane, the league\u2019s chief diversity and inclusion officer. \u201cThe NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.\u201d GLAAD also issued a statement calling Butker\u2019s speech \u201ca clear miss\u201d and \u201cwoefully out of step with Americans about Pride, LGBTQ people and women.\u201d The Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions and one of the NFL\u2019s marquee teams, have not responded to requests for comment. However, plenty of women (and Taylor Swift fans) have made their feelings plainly known. That could keep Butker\u2019s social media feeds clogged with criticism for the foreseeable future. It also could be an optical problem for the NFL and the Chiefs, who have both enjoyed increased support from female fans in the past year. What Butker said about women \u2014 and Taylor Swift In front of the crowd of about 485 male and female graduates, Butker suggested that a woman\u2019s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals. \u201cI want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.\u201d Butker also praised his wife Isabelle, saying she \u201cwould be the first to say her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.\u201d Judging from the hundreds upon hundreds of critical comments on Butker\u2019s Instagram posts and about him on X and TikTok, his remarks did not sit well with many people. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a case of foot-in-mouth. It was a well-prepared speech,\u201d wrote columnist Sam McDowell in the Kansas City Star. \u201cWomen listening in the audience, rather than being rewarded with a diploma on graduation day, were made to listen as he promoted the role of homemaker \u2014 not as an acceptable choice, but as their duty as a husband\u2019s servant.\u201d It also didn\u2019t sit well with many people that Butker invoked Swift, the pop star who is dating Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce and who was a frequent sight at Chiefs games this past season, including the Super Bowl. Butker likely became the first person in history to quote a Taylor Swift song while criticizing Catholic priests for catering too much to the feelings of their parishioners. \u201cAs my teammate\u2019s girlfriend says: \u2018Familiarity breeds contempt,\u2019\u201d Butker said at one point, quoting Swift\u2019s song \u201cBejeweled\u201d (and, by extension, a common turn of phrase). Conservative voices have praised Butker\u2019s speech for being \u201c100% correct\u201d and for reflecting his self-professed deep Catholic faith. However, his reference to Swift \u2014 a childless, unmarried superstar and feminist figure who by Butker\u2019s own definition is not living up to her potential \u2014 has prompted additional outcry. Feminists and Taylor Swift fans have fired back Butker, 28, has been with the Chiefs for seven seasons. He kicked four field goals as the Chiefs edged the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22, in February to win the Super Bowl. Before his speech, Butker\u2019s Instagram account was rather innocuous: Mostly photos of his gameday outfits paired with Bible quotes, posed shots next to conservative figures and bits of Christian wisdom, all met with generally hospitable commentary from fans. Now, nearly every recent post on his account has been overrun with insults, some questioning how Butker feels about women like Swift, who have found success outside of marriage and motherhood: \u201cI feel bad for those poor women who looked forward to their graduation and had you inflicted upon them.\u201d \u201cHave a talk with Travis about how you can be successful, masculine AND still incredibly supportive of your girlfriend\u2019s career.\u201d The deluge of criticism reached almost every corner of social media, and people took notice. \u201cAs a woman, does watching Harrison Butker get cooked online count as being in the kitchen,\u201d reads one popular post on X. \u201cI\u2019ll let the Swifties handle Harrison Butker,\u201d reads another. Commenters and social influencers also picked up on another piece of information that appears at odds with Butker\u2019s worldview. His mother, Elizabeth Keller Butker, is a medical physicist at Emory University\u2019s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta and holds, among other academic accolades, a degree in chemistry from Smith College, a private women\u2019s liberal arts college in Massachusetts. \u201cWhat does your mom think about your little speech, Harrison?\u201d asked Vicki Chan, a doctor and TikTok creator with more than 500,000 followers. CNN has reached out to Benedictine College, where Butker gave his address, and is awaiting a response. The backlash comes as the NFL is trying to court female fans While the fallout from Butker\u2019s address is messy enough already, there\u2019s another complicating detail to consider. The NFL has tried to woo female fans for years. When Swift began appearing at Chiefs games last fall to support her boyfriend Kelce, female interest in the NFL skyrocketed. Super Bowl LVIII, in which the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers and the superstar couple shared picture-perfect embraces after the victory, was the most-watched Super Bowl ever. Even NFL commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged the \u201cTaylor Swift effect\u201d on the season. To many, Butker\u2019s comments are a kick in the face to a burgeoning, and valuable,  demographic of NFL fans. \u201cHey NFL. If you want to continue to grow your female fan base and any other marginalized group (straight white men are already watching your product), come get your boy,\u201d tweeted former \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d reporter Lisa Guerrero. Some commenters also asked the Chiefs to issue a response to Butker\u2019s remarks in the interest of their female fans. So far, the Chiefs have not made a public comment. Butker\u2019s speech contained other polarizing comments While Butker\u2019s remarks about women and Taylor Swift inspired a very specific sort of backlash, critics had plenty to say about the other parts of his speech, too. A few details in particular have stirred up discontent: \u2022 Butker criticized President Joe Biden, who is Catholic, and other unnamed Catholic leaders for \u201cpushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to transgender rights. \u2022 In a swipe at LGBTQ communities, Butker encouraged graduates to have Catholic pride, but \u201cnot the deadly sin sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it.\u201d \u2022 Butker also waded into the DEI debate, saying, \u201cThe world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion.\u201d In response to his comments about diversity, Tennessean reporter Andrea Williams pointed out Butker shares the field with Patrick Mahomes, who is considered one of the best players of his generation and is one of only a handful of Black quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl. \u201cHarrison Butker doesn\u2019t have three Super Bowl rings without Patrick Mahomes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd without those Super Bowl rings, he doesn\u2019t have the aforementioned praise or platform.\u201d Some women also pointed out that Butker\u2019s understanding of Catholicism \u2014 and what the faith asks of its adherents \u2014 is far from universal. Journalist Yvette Walker wrote a faith-based critique for the Kansas City Star, noting the many women of the Bible who contributed to their communities outside of traditional gender roles. \u201cI hope the women in the audience who didn\u2019t agree with everything Butker said remember that they can think for themselves, read the Bible for themselves, and choose the reasoning God granted to live a full and worthwhile life whether you have a family or not,\u201d she wrote.

{"id": "2024_05_11_europe_european-parliament-populists-security-concerns-intl-cmd", "text": "Right-wing populists are set to make unprecedented gains in the\u00a0elections to the\u00a0European Parliament\u00a0taking\u00a0place next month. As European officials brace for a new-look parliament, there are growing concerns that the 27-nation bloc could become more vulnerable to adversarial states seeking to do the union harm. Polling data\u00a0suggests that far-right Members of the European Parliament\u00a0(MEPs)\u00a0could have enough seats to, together, block the passage of European Union legislation, creating a massive headache for the union as a whole. As important as this\u00a0shift\u00a0may\u00a0become in influencing the most powerful people in Brussels and the direction of the bloc, officials are now\u00a0concerned about the impact this will have on the EU\u2019s security. The recent arrest\u00a0of a German national working as an aide to a far-right MEP\u00a0on suspicion of spying for China\u00a0has fueled fears that a substantial influx of Euroskeptic, anti-establishment figures who have lived lives on the fringes of\u00a0mainstream\u00a0politics\u00a0will mean a lot of sitting ducks for adversarial states to target. \u201cElected populists are uniquely attractive to malign actors for two reasons,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0James Shires, co-director of the European Cyber Conflict Research Initiative. \u201cFirst, they are anti-establishment figures who don\u2019t trust the institutions or structures they now work inside. It is hard to make the jump from believing there is an establishment conspiracy against you to cooperating with those institutions to counter security threats,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSecond, in many cases, there is instinctive alignment with states like China or Russia. They agree with them in certain areas and are happy to put forward views, and even spread misinformation, on their behalf.\u201d While hostile actors attempting to influence politicians is hardly new, an influx of populists to an institution\u00a0like the European Parliament at this precise moment in time is particularly concerning. One point European security officials make is that these smaller, newer\u00a0parties don\u2019t have much experience of working with security services, or even\u00a0have much experience \u2014 or indeed interest \u2014\u00a0in vetting their own\u00a0candidates or staffers. The European Parliament itself does not have a unit set up to screen parliamentarians and relies on the 27\u00a0EU\u00a0member states who send MEPs to Brussels and Strasbourg. \u201cFor some countries, that is a six-month process, in others it can take two years,\u201d a senior\u00a0European\u00a0Parliament source told CNN. \u201cLarge parts of the EU treaties don\u2019t apply to security services, so we have very little central oversight and countries are not obliged to send us sensitive information. We can do criminal record checks but, you\u2019ll be shocked to learn, most spies don\u2019t have active criminal records.\u201d What damage could an MEP actually do once elected to the European Parliament? There are multiple opportunities to wreak havoc from inside the system, but two in particular stand out. The first is more innocuous on the surface. MEPs are allowed to make speeches in\u00a0parliament that are recorded, clipped and promoted on social media. Many British former MEPs\u00a0used these speeches to great effect between 2010 and 2016 as a way of spreading Euroskepticism in Britain. This ultimately\u00a0played into\u00a0Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. If\u00a0MEPs\u00a0want\u00a0to stand up and spread misinformation or disinformation that aligns with\u00a0the objectives of\u00a0states who are hostile to the EU, they are perfectly entitled to do so. They can stand up and denounce Europe\u2019s support for Ukraine, rail against equal marriage and climate change, all to undermine Western ideas and sow disunity. Knowingly or unknowingly, it doesn\u2019t matter: If it aligns with the interests of a hostile state, it aligns with the interests of a hostile state. This is difficult for the EU because, unless\u00a0an MEP is\u00a0being paid directly by a foreign state to lobby and lie on\u00a0its\u00a0behalf, it\u2019s perfectly legal. \u201cOne can be \u2018Putinist\u2019, or \u2018Xi\u2019st\u2019, and that is OK \u2014 in the sense that they have\u00a0a\u00a0right to their opinion. It only becomes an issue if they are working with foreign powers to advance their agenda,\u201d an EU security source\u00a0told CNN. \u201cOtherwise, it is democratically legitimate for them to have an opinion and express it in the Parliament.\u201d The second major way an MEP or member of\u00a0their staff could hurt the EU to the benefit of a hostile state is through illegal means. Leaking sensitive information\u00a0to which\u00a0they have access, aiding\u00a0in\u00a0cyberattacks, stealing documents and handing them over to foreign actors \u2013\u00a0what is considered\u00a0more classic espionage. Between the 27 member states \u2014\u00a0all of whom have embassies, multiple institutions, hundreds of elected officials and thousands of members of staff \u2014\u00a0Brussels is a place where lots of sensitive information is flying around.\u00a0Quite a bit of it gets leaked. Anything from future EU plans to\u00a0the\u00a0personal details of individuals could be valuable to those who wish to do the EU harm. One senior EU diplomat\u00a0told CNN that this was of particular concern now that Europe is taking more serious and direct action in security and defense policy in response to Russia\u2019s\u00a0full-scale\u00a0invasion of Ukraine\u00a0in 2022. With Brussels seeking to be taken ever more seriously as a diplomatic player, its own security will come under increasing pressure from international rivals. Whether it takes sufficient measures to stop those who want to\u00a0do it\u00a0harm\u00a0rests solely with the EU and its member states.\u00a0And failure to do so could scupper those grand ambitions of greater global relevance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/europe/european-parliament-populists-security-concerns-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_middleeast_egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn", "text": "Egypt\u2019s Great Pyramid and other ancient monuments at Giza exist on an isolated strip of land at the edge of the Sahara Desert. The inhospitable location has long puzzled archaeologists, some of whom had found evidence that the Nile River once flowed near these pyramids in some capacity, facilitating the landmarks\u2019 construction starting 4,700 years ago. Using satellite imaging and analysis of cores of sediment, a new study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment has mapped a 64-kilometer (40-mile) long, dried-up, branch of the Nile, long buried beneath farmland and desert. \u201cEven though many efforts to reconstruct the early Nile waterways have been conducted, they have largely been confined to soil sample collections from small sites, which has led to the mapping of only fragmented sections of the ancient Nile channel systems,\u201d said lead study author Eman Ghoneim, a professor and director of the Space and Drone Remote Sensing Lab at the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s department of Earth and ocean sciences. \u201cThis is the first study to provide the first map of the long-lost ancient branch of the Nile River.\u201d Ghoneim and her colleagues refer to this extinct branch of the Nile river as Ahramat, which is Arabic for pyramids. The ancient waterway would have been about 0.5 kilometers wide (about one-third of a mile) with a depth of at least 25 meters (82 feet) \u2014 similar to the contemporary Nile, Ghoneim said. \u201cThe large size and extended length of the Ahramat Branch and its proximity to the 31 pyramids in the study area strongly suggests a functional waterway of great importance,\u201d Ghoneim said. She said the river would have played a key role in ancient Egyptians\u2019 transportation of the enormous amount of building materials and laborers needed for the pyramids\u2019 construction. \u201cAlso, our research shows that many of the pyramids in the study area have (a) causeway, a ceremonial raised walkway, that runs perpendicular to the course of the Ahramat Branch and terminates directly on its riverbank.\u201d Hidden traces of a lost waterway Traces of the river aren\u2019t visible in aerial photos or in imagery from optical satellites, Ghoneim said. In fact, she only spotted something unexpected while studying radar satellite data of the wider area for ancient rivers and lakes that might reveal a new source of groundwater. \u201cI am a geomorphologist, a paleohydrologist\u00a0looking into landforms. I have this kind of trained eye,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile working with this data, I noticed this really obvious branch or a kind of riverbank, and it didn\u2019t make any sense because it is really far from the Nile,\u201d she added. Born and raised in Egypt, Ghoneim was familiar with the cluster of pyramids in this area and had always wondered why they were built there. She applied to the National Science Foundation to investigate further, and geophysical data taken at ground level with the use of ground-penetrating radar and electromagnetic tomography confirmed it was an ancient arm of the Nile. Two long cores of earth the team extracted using drilling equipment revealed sandy sediment consistent with a river channel at a depth of about 25 meters (82 feet). It\u2019s possible that \u201ccountless\u201d temples might still be buried beneath the agricultural fields and desert sands along the riverbank of the Ahramat Branch, according to the study. Why this branch of the river dried up or disappeared is still unclear. Most likely, a period of drought and desertification swept sand into the region, silting up the river, Ghoneim said. The study demonstrated that when the pyramids were built, the geography and riverscapes of the Nile differed significantly from those of today, said Nick Marriner, a geographer at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. He was not involved in the study but has conducted research on the fluvial history of Giza. \u201cThe study completes an important part of the past landscape puzzle,\u201d Marriner said. \u201cBy putting together these pieces we can gain a clearer picture of what the Nile floodplain looked like at the time of the pyramid builders and how the ancient Egyptians harnessed their environments to transport building materials for their monumental construction endeavors.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, located in the San Rafael neighborhood of Mexico City, was among the establishments to garner either one or two stars in the first ever Michelin Guide Mexico, published earlier this week, making it the first Mexican taco stand to receive the honor. Chef Arturo Rivera Mart\u00ednez, who has been serving customers at Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n for at least two decades, was presented with the famous white chef\u2019s jacket while dishing out his popular tacos on Wednesday. \u201cThe secret is the simplicity of our taco,\u201d Rivera Mart\u00ednez told the Associated Press. \u201cIt has only a tortilla, red or green sauce, and that\u2019s it. That, and the quality of the meat.\u201d Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, which is only about 10 feet wide, has been around for more than 50 years and is known for its Gaonera taco, apparently named in honor of Mexican bullfighter Rodolfo Gaona. \u201cThis taqueria may be bare bones with just enough room for a handful of diners to stand at the counter but its creation, the Gaonera taco, is exceptional,\u201d reads a statement on the Michelin Guide website. \u201cThinly sliced beef filet is expertly cooked to order, seasoned with only salt and a squeeze of lime. \u201cAt the same time, a second cook prepares the excellent corn tortillas alongside. The resulting combination is elemental and pure.\u201d When asked which drink he\u2019d recommend that diners match with the \u201cexceptional\u201d tacos, Rivera Mart\u00ednez told reporters, \u201cI like a Coke.\u201d Aside from the aforementioned Gaonera taco, customers can opt for three other meat-filled variations, including a bistec (beef steak) filling, served up on a plastic plate for around $5. \u201cWith meat and tortillas of this caliber, the duo of house-made salsas is hardly even necessary,\u201d says the Michelin Guide. Fine dining restaurant Quintonil, run by chef Jorge Vallejo and Alejandra Flores, awarded two stars, and chef Elena Reygadas\u2019s Rosetta, awarded one star, were among the other establishments included on Michelin\u2019s first-ever rankings for Mexico. Focusing on Mexico City, Oaxaca, Baja California, Los Cabos and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the Michelin Guide inspectors traveled up and down the country to seek out the best culinary experiences on offer. \u201cWhat a joy it is to honor the uniqueness of the Mexican gastronomic landscape in Mexico City,\u201d Gwendal Poullennec, International Director of the Michelin Guides, said in a statement. \u201cThe first and very promising selection is an an illustration of how the country is showcasing its regions, with their cultures and traditions that are as distinctive as they are distinguishable.\u201d Back in 2016, chef Chan Hon Meng\u2019s Singapore stall became the first street-food establishment to be recognized by the distinguished guide.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/taqueria-el-califa-de-leon-mexico-city/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world and has lost a string of diplomatic allies to Beijing in recent years. Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have championed LGBTQ+ rights, making it a more liberal bastion in conservative Asia.\u00a0The self-ruled island is one of the most progressive societies for sexual minorities.\u00a0In a first for the region, Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage in 2019.\u00a0Across the strait, China has been fast moving the opposite direction under Chinese leader Xi Jinping,\u00a0with crackdowns\u00a0on LGBTQ groups and content. Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, hosts East Asia\u2019s largest Pride march every October. Last year, Vice President Lai Ching-te, who will take office on Monday as Taiwan\u2019s next president, became the most senior government leader ever to attend the celebration. Reactions to the spectacle on social media were largely positive. \u201cThank you for allowing us to be at the forefront so that we can proudly show the world how free we are,\u201d said one\u00a0user commenting on Nymphia\u2019s performance on Tsai\u2019s official Facebook account, which concluded with her singing to popstar Jolin Tsai\u2019s gender equality hit \u201cWomxnly\u201d and joined by five of her fellow drag queens. \u201cI wanted to cry at the end; Taiwan has come such a long way from a time where we were called feminine, to having same sex marriage legalized and drag queens performing at the presidential palace today,\u201d wrote another. Not everyone was fan. One user wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know what drag queens are, but I don\u2019t want my kids to be like this.\u201d While on China\u2019s Weibo, some took issue of the performance taking place in front of the bust of Sun Yat Sen, who is often called the father of modern China and whose legacy is claimed by the governments of both China and Taiwan. Nymphia, the alter-ego of Taiwanese American dressmaker Leo Tsao, was the first East Asian to win \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d and she made it a point during her time on the show to raise awareness and appreciation of her cultural background. On the show\u2019s finale she wore a dramatic outfit inspired by bubble tea, one of Taiwan\u2019s biggest cultural exports, and many of her outfits referenced Asian heritage. Nymphia is a well-established artist on Taiwan\u2019s thriving drag scene, known for over-the-top outfits that she creates herself. She has performed in Taiwanese temples and undertook a photoshoot at wet markets dressed as bananas in various stages of ripeness. The tropical fruit is a common motif in Nymphia\u2019s creations that\u2019s become a trademark of sorts.

{"id": "2024_05_15_weather_canada-wildfires-fort-mcmurray-climate-wednesday", "text": "Improving winds and a storm moving into western Canada are providing a temporary boost to firefighters battling massive wildfires, but the danger remains heightened as they burn close to three communities. Drought-starved vegetation and days of gusty winds have fueled more than 100 wildfires tearing across Canada that have choked the air with smoke and forced thousands to evacuate since the weekend. But weather conditions took a turn midweek and are providing some help for firefighters working to gain the upper hand on the flames. Winds have died down in some areas and shifted in others, pushing flames away from Alberta\u2019s Fort McMurray, a city still haunted by a catastrophic 2016 fire dubbed \u201cThe Beast.\u201d A large, slow-moving storm will also track through western and central Canada from midweek into the weekend. Cooler air from the storm will flow across fire-torn provinces while relative humidity levels rise and chances for rain increase. While the assist from Mother Nature will not last indefinitely, any potential containment is welcome news for the thousands of people whose homes and businesses are at risk. Roads out of Fort McMurray were crammed with evacuating cars Tuesday as an out-of-control 51,000-acre wildfire\u00a0crept toward the city\u2019s edge. The approaching flames conjured up terrifying memories for residents who lived through the 2016 fires, which forced 90,000 people to evacuate and wrought billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses. Evacuation orders were issued for the city\u2019s neighborhoods of Prairie Creek, Beacon Hill, Abasand and Grayling Terrace on Tuesday. The rest of the city and several surrounding suburbs are on alert to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice. Roughly 6,600 people in Alberta had evacuated as of Wednesday,\u00a0local officials said during a Wednesday news conference. Residents can expect to be away from their homes until at least May 21, the regional municipality said in a news release. A veil of thick smoke made it difficult for firefighters to see as they battled \u201cextreme fire behavior,\u201d Tuesday Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said. Safety concerns have prompted some firefighters to be removed from the front lines. Officials sought to assuage the concerns of residents who vividly recall the 2016 fires, which tore through more than 1.4 million acres and destroyed about 2,400 homes and businesses \u2013 the most expensive natural disaster in Canada\u2019s history. \u201cI want to recognize the anxiety that this brings, certainly to those residents that were here in 2016, and to those where this is their first experience and have heard the stories,\u201d said Regional Fire Chief Jody Butz. \u201cWe are confident that we have the resources to defend these areas, but we need people out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d St-Onge said Wednesday less than 1 millimeter of rain fell on the fire overnight. \u201cActive fire behavior is expected today but should be less than yesterday, thanks to cooler temperatures and weaker winds,\u201d she said, adding firefighters would begin establishing a containment line. Currently, 117 firefighters and 21 helicopters have been assigned to the firefight, according to St-Onge. But despite the weather improvements, St-Onge warned there was \u201ca lot of work to be done to contain this fire and we are still expecting high fire activity today.\u201d The country\u2019s wildfire season is off to a troubling pace as new fires ignite each day and dormant so-called \u201czombie\u201d fires reanimate. The 2024 fire season isn\u2019t yet on par with last year\u2019s record-shattering season but with wildfire behavior worsening in a warming world it\u2019s no wonder Canadian fire officials are warning of an \u201cexplosive\u201d season that may rival last year. Hazardous smoke from the blazes has also been wafting into the US and reducing air quality. Degraded air quality levels were in place Wednesday from the Dakotas into Oklahoma. The central US will remain the focal point for Canadian smoke through at least midweek, before it is pushed from the area by an incoming storm system. \u2018It\u2019s a war zone\u2019 Multiple blazes exploded in size across several provinces early this week, forcing thousands of Canadians to flee their homes with children, pets and bags stuffed with essentials and cherished possessions in tow. \u201cThis is a very difficult time for people who have been asked to leave behind their home, their belongings and their community without the certainty of what will remain when they return,\u201d Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said in a Tuesday statement. Manitoba first responders are tackling one of the largest wildfires in Canada, which has consumed at least 78,000 acres and was within a mile of the Cranberry Portage community as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the province\u2019s media release. More than 500 residents had been evacuated from the area as several neighborhoods were ordered to leave. In British Columbia, more favorable weather conditions helped slow the advance of the northeastern Parker Lake Fire toward the town of Fort Nelson. At least 4,800 people in the area are under evacuation orders, including the Fort Nelson First Nation. Rick Seidel, the owner of a local construction and trucking company,\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Canadian news partner CBC he stayed back to help fight the flames. \u201cWe\u2019ve had all our equipment ready and all our water trucks were loaded. When the call came we jumped into action,\u201d Seidel told CBC on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad. It\u2019s a war zone right now,\u201d Seidel said. Climate change fuels worsening wildfires Gusty winds are driving ongoing fires in Canada, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada,\u00a0according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada\u2019s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the\u00a0BC Wildfire Service. There are more than 130 fires burning across Canada, 42 of which are considered out of control,\u00a0according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Some of the blazes are so-called \u201choldover fires\u201d also known colloquially as \u201czombie fires,\u201d the smoldering remains of last season\u2019s epic blazes, burning deep in the ground throughout the winter and reigniting when exposed to warmer temperatures in the spring. \u201cIn the past, the winter conditions are what put out a lot of holdover fires,\u201d said Bowinn Ma, British Columbia\u2019s minister of emergency management and climate readiness. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve seen is that due to higher temperatures and persistent drought through the last year, many of these holdover fires were not put out like they normally are.\u201d CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/weather/canada-wildfires-fort-mcmurray-climate-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_georgia-foreign-agents-law-explained-intl", "text": "Georgia\u2019s parliament passed a highly controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that has triggered widespread protests across the former Soviet republic nestled in the Caucasus Mountains. Tens of thousands of people in capital city Tbilisi have been protesting the legislation. Critics warn that it mirrors a foreign agents law already passed in Russia and could jeopardize Georgia\u2019s bid to join the European Union. But Prime Minister\u00a0Irakli Kobakhidze succeeded and got it through the parliament on Tuesday, with 84 lawmakers voting in favor of the law and 30 against it in the 150-seat legislature. President Salome Zourabichvili has vowed to veto the law, but the parliament can easily override her. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the law and the uproar it has caused. What\u2019s in the law? The law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face crippling fines. The legislation was drafted by the Georgian Dream party, which along with its allies controls parliament. Zourabichvili called the bill \u201can exact duplicate\u201d of its Russian counterpart in an interview with CNN. What happens next? Zourabichvili has vowed to veto the bill, but that won\u2019t mean much. She now has two weeks to do so. But the Georgian parliament can override her objection with a simple majority. Georgia\u2019s government is a parliamentary system, so Zourabichvili is effectively a figurehead. Real power lies with Kobakhidze, the PM. Georgian Dream\u2019s billionaire founder, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, also wields significant political influence. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Zourabichvili said the upcoming elections in October will give the population a chance to \u201creverse\u201d the bill. \u201cWe have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections because that\u2019s the European way,\u201d she said. Why is it so controversial? A couple of reasons. The law is modeled after a similar one in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents law will be used to the same way it has been in its northern neighbor: to quash dissent and free expression by going after nongovernmental organizations with financial ties overseas. The law has had a devastating impact on non-profits and human rights groups in Russia, forcing many to cease their activities. Georgian Dream contends the legislation will promote transparency and national sovereignty and has hit back at Western criticism over the proposal. But the law\u2019s possible passage has touched on a more existential question: whether Georgia\u2019s future lies with Europe or Russia. Georgia has, like Ukraine, been caught between the two geopolitical forces since achieving independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Many Georgians feel deep hostility toward the Kremlin, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory \u2013 about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine. Georgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that Ivanishvili made his fortune in the Soviet Union. How do most Georgians feel about it? Passionately. So much so that lawmakers at one point came to blows over the bill. Polling shows that about 80% of Georgians support joining the European Union rather than drifting further into the Kremlin\u2019s orbit, and many of those in favor of deepening ties with the West have taken to the streets. Mass demonstrations against the bill in Tbilisi had been going on nightly for a month before its passing. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the capital, which is home to about 1 million people, to speak out against what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cthe Russian law.\u201d There have been counter-protests as well. One saw the usually reclusive Ivanishvili deliver a rare speech to a crowd of supporters bussed in to Tbilisi from Georgia\u2019s rural regions, where Georgian Dream enjoys more support. The address showed deep paranoia and an autocratic streak. Ivanishvili claimed that Georgia was being controlled by \u201ca pseudo-elite nurtured by a foreign country\u201d and pledged to go after his political opponents after October\u2019s elections. Didn\u2019t Georgia already go through this? Yes, just last year. Georgia\u2019s government tried to pass the same law but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense\u00a0protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water cannons. The bill was reintroduced in March, about a month after Kobakhidze became Prime Minister. This time, authorities seem determined to push the legislation through. What have other countries said? White House national security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan wrote on X that Washington is \u201cdeeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in\u00a0Georgia.\u201d \u201cGeorgian parliamentarians face a critical choice \u2013 whether to support the\u00a0Georgian people\u2019s Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents\u2019 law that runs counter to democratic values,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stand with the\u00a0Georgian people.\u201d The Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to \u201cprovoke anti-Russian sentiments,\u201d adding that protests against it were being stirred by \u201coutside\u201d influences. \u201cThis is now the normal practice of a huge number of states that are doing everything to protect themselves from outside influence, from foreign influence on domestic politics. And all countries are taking action in one form or another, but all these bills have the same goal,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in April. \u201cOnce again, there is no way to link this bill and the desire to secure Georgia\u2019s internal politics with some kind of Russian influence; this is not the case.\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement earlier this month that she was following the developments in George with \u201cgreat concern\u201d and reiterated Brussels\u2019 unease over the law. \u201cGeorgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,\u201d she said. Could the law impact Georgia\u2019s ability to join the EU? Definitely. Georgia first applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, an important but still early step in the process of becoming a member of the bloc. However, Brussels said last month that the law\u2019s passage would \u201cnegatively impact\u201d Georgia\u2019s path to EU membership \u201cGeorgia has a vibrant civil society that contributes to the country\u2019s successful progress towards EU membership. The proposed legislation would limit the capacity of civil society and media organizations to operate freely, could limit freedom of expression and unfairly stigmatize organizations that deliver benefits to the citizens of Georgia,\u201d EU officials said. \u201cThe EU urges Georgia to refrain from adopting legislation that can compromise Georgia\u2019s EU path, a path supported by the overwhelming majority of Georgian citizens.\u201d CNN\u2019s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/georgia-foreign-agents-law-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_asia_romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e", "text": "Moving from America to India as a child in the 1950s would likely be a challenging experience for most, but for Romulus Whitaker it was a dream come true \u2014 he had arrived in \u201cthe land of cobras,\u201d he explained to CNN. Whitaker would go on to earn the nickname \u201cSnakeman of India,\u201d and spend more than six decades dedicated to reptile research and conservation. He\u2019s written several books on snakes, spearheaded a lifesaving anti-venom program, and launched wildlife research stations throughout the country. His field work with snakes and crocodiles ultimately led his conservation efforts to help save India\u2019s rainforests. Today, Whitaker\u2019s focus is on educating Indians on how to protect themselves from snakes \u2014 part of a national campaign to reduce the snakebite mortality rate. CNN spoke with Whitaker recently at his home in Mysore, southwestern India, around the release of the first volume of his memoir: \u201cSnakes, Drugs and Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll: My Early Years.\u201d The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: How did you first become interested in snakes? Whitaker: I started out as a very young lad in northern New York state, turning over rocks and finding bugs and stuff, until I found a snake, and it was love at first sight. It really started then. But I must blame or thank my mother for when I first brought a snake home. She said, \u2018wow, how beautiful.\u2019 And now, which mother would do that? Not very many. Then, when my mother married Rama Chattopadhyay and we moved to India, that was something that opened up the world to me. Can you imagine an eight-year-old arriving in Bombay and being able to go out into the jungles of India? These are dreams that I had when I was a little kid, which came alive. CNN: What does a herpetologist do and what was your journey to becoming one? Whitaker: A herpetologist is a strange person who studies reptiles. I\u2019ve concentrated most of my work on snakes and crocodiles, but I am very interested in all the others \u2026 the turtles, the lizards, and of course the amphibians, the frogs and toads. I\u2019ve been doing this forever, ever since I was four years old when I picked up my first snake. [In 1960] I was going to college in America, but I flunked out. Then I got a job at the Miami Serpentarium and worked for this gentleman [Bill Haast] who handled king cobras with the greatest of ease and extracted their venom. That was part of the love affair that I generated for king cobras. But I had always yearned to come back to India and get out to Western Ghats, where I knew king cobras still lived, and start studying them. In 1969, I set up India\u2019s first snake park, the Madras Snake Park. And we\u2019ve learned more about king cobra behavior and about their wonderful lifestyle than had ever been known by anybody before. CNN: Have you ever been scared of a snake? Whitaker: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been scared of a snake. I\u2019ve been scared of myself sometimes doing stupid things. I saw a black-tailed [snake] disappearing into the bushes, and I thought, \u2018ah, big rat snake.\u2019 And I dove on it, typical football tackle, grabbed it by the tail and suddenly this hooded snake rises up over me and I looked up and said, \u2018oh no, I think I\u2019ve caught the wrong tail.\u2019 And I let it go. It was a king cobra, the first one I had ever found. It was scary. Okay, I am scared sometimes. CNN: How did you first get involved with the indigenous Irula tribe to help create anti-venom to treat people bitten by snakes? Whitaker: The Irulas are an aboriginal tribe here in South India. Their expertise is finding and catching snakes and their specialty [was] catching snakes for their skins. But they had run out of a way to make a living because the snakeskin industry had been banned [in 1972]. So we hatched an idea together to set up a venom cooperative, the Irula Snake Catchers Cooperative, wherein they would catch snakes from the wild, extract the venom, and then release the snakes back to the wild. And the venom, it was used to make anti-venom to save millions of lives. CNN: Today a big focus of your work is preventing snakebites in the first place. Tell us more about that. Whitaker: Up until recently, we really didn\u2019t know how many people are getting killed and injured by snakes. The Centre for Global Health Research and the University of Toronto started doing this Million Deaths Study. And I\u2019m a coauthor of two of the major papers produced out of this study, and it turns out that close to 50,000 people are actually killed by snake bite every year in India. Now that we know the figure, we are working very hard right now on an educational program, which is nationwide, trying to teach people how to avoid snakes and avoid getting bitten. It\u2019s fairly simple: at night when you walk around, use a light. When you sleep, use a mosquito net. We tell people when they\u2019re working in the field, when they\u2019re doing agriculture, use a stick. Don\u2019t use your bare hand because a snake could be there. So it\u2019s just educating people. These are simple methods. CNN: At what point in your career did you get involved with conservation? Whitaker: My early, formative years were not very conservation-oriented. I was the kid with a gun, and I would go out there and instead of being a bird watcher, I was a bird shooter. The transition from being from a hunter to a conservationist happened [in the 1970s] when I realized that things were really out of hand here, and crocodiles were almost extinct by that time. And we really had to do something about it. I realized that unless I got into conservation, there\u2019s not going to be anything left. I set up field stations along with my colleagues and they are magnets for people who want to get into working with reptiles. And we\u2019ve had dozens and dozens of people who have now turned out to be some of the greatest conservationists in India we can call graduates of these stations. CNN: You\u2019re currently working on a three-part memoir. What would you like your legacy to be? Whitaker: People will remember me, like it or not, as a snake freak. But it\u2019s wonderful to think [of] the influence that I have had or that our organizations have had to engender this incredible deep interest in something which people sneered at or ran away from all their lives, but now suddenly, hey, they\u2019re interesting, they\u2019re hip, they\u2019re in. Snakes rule! And it\u2019s wonderful to realize that dozens, if not hundreds, of young people have continued to do wonderful work with reptiles. It\u2019s just wonderful.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/asia/romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_15_americas_new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam", "text": " A simple act of walking into a mosque with his wife and two children in New York City is what made the past six months of struggle worth it for Ye Chengxiang \u2013 even if not everyone is celebrating his arrival. \u201cIt\u2019s only been over two months here, but we can feel the spirit of freedom, inclusiveness, and equality,\u201d he said over a bowl of noodles. It was his only day off from working 12-hour shifts at a Chinese restaurant in New York City. The slim former restaurant owner left China last October. The ruling Communist Party\u2019s crackdown on his Hui Muslim ethnic group and growing restrictions on personal life gave his family no choice, he says. \u201cWhen I was in China, I had a pent-up feeling in my heart,\u201d he said of living as a Muslim in China, where his children were banned from entering a mosque. Ye and his wife drained $40,000 of their life savings and illegally crossed the United States\u2019 southern border in December after an exhausting weeks-long journey that saw the family take a hazardous boat journey from Colombia to the edge of the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region that connects South and Central America. His anxieties melted away as Ye crossed into the US, which he described as entering a warm embrace. \u201cI felt like I was home, and that feeling was very real,\u201d he said. Their destination was New York City\u2019s Flushing neighborhood, home to a Chinese community going back generations. The city has integrated\u202fmillions\u202fof migrants over the decades, and it continues to inspire newcomers like Ye \u2013 even as the arrival of such migrants has turned into a flashpoint in US politics ahead of the November elections. After arriving in New York, Ye spent a week in a Manhattan shelter. Then, with the help of a group of other Chinese Muslim\u202fasylum\u202fseekers, he found a place to live and a job making noodles as his family proceeded through the religious\u202fasylum claim process.\u202f Their first court date is in October He is exhausted, barely having time to learn English or explore the new city. But he is happy. The first time that he walked to a mosque in Flushing with his wife and daughters, \u201cI immediately felt that rock, that lump in my heart, dissolve away,\u201d he told CNN. On downtown Flushing\u2019s Main Street, people hand out fliers offering help, for a fee, for the undocumented to secure drivers\u2019 licenses. Alongside the street vendors hawking vegetables, undocumented migrants walk into buildings with employment agencies offering restaurant and sales jobs. This is what draws Chinese migrants toward enclaves like Flushing and Sunset Park, where immigrant networks, legal service centers, job markets and nonprofits form a vital support system. For Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers like Ye, there is a well-trodden route to residency in the US. Chinese nationals have the\u202fhighest\u202fnumber of asylum claims granted\u202f\u00a0in the US compared to other nationalities, because their \u201cpathway to claiming political\u202fasylum\u202f[for Chinese nationals] is more codified,\u201d said Amy Hsin, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York, who specializes in immigration and social inequality.\u00a0 The US expanded\u202fasylum\u202fpathways\u202ffor Chinese citizens in the past due to geopolitical events and policies, like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and the one-child policy, she explained. Recently, growing restrictions on freedoms in China and its stuttering economy have led to this new influx of disillusioned Chinese citizens. More than 37,000 Chinese citizens were picked up by law enforcement crossing illegally from Mexico in 2023, US government data shows. That\u2019s up from around 3,800 people the year before, and many of them were headed to New York City, according to experts. \u2018America is better\u2019 On the fourth floor of an old mall, migrant workers walk into a legal service center. They say they have lost their passports, or had them confiscated, in the melee of voluntarily turning themselves in for\u202fasylum\u202fwith the Customs and Border Protection. The office, which helps them in their\u202fasylum\u202fapplications, also connects them with the Chinese Embassy to apply for new travel documents. In the waiting room, migrants told CNN how videos on social media, providing detailed instructions on how to cross Central America to the US, inspired them to make the journey. They spoke of the socio-economic pressures back in China, made worse by pandemic restrictions and its lack of economic rebound, forcing them to leave the country. The center\u2019s owner, who declined to be named in this story because he does not have a license to practice law in the US, has helped more than 100 Chinese nationals since opening the office two years ago. The burden of proof for\u202fasylum\u202fclaims in the US is high and the owner said many of his clients have struggled to provide concrete evidence of political and religious repression they faced in China. Many go on to protest against the Chinese government once in the US, freed from Chinese authorities and its censors, he said. Dressed simply in jeans and a black jacket, Jiang Zhen said the\u202fsweeping crackdown\u202fon free speech, civil society and religion was suffocating him in China. He believes he was blacklisted for criticizing China\u2019s government on social media sites, his accounts banned or suspended. Poverty in rural China, like in his hometown in Hunan province, had become unbearable, with relatives and parents of friends \u201cdrinking pesticides, drowning themselves in rivers, or hanging themselves \u2026 especially when they are suffering from diseases like cancer and have no money for treatment,\u201d he said, adding that the Chinese government ignores \u201cthe living conditions of the lower classes.\u201d CNN has reached to Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment about claims of political and religious repression, but they have yet to respond. As he waits for his work permit, which can take up to 18 months to approve, the 33-year-old now works illegally cleaning dishes at a Cantonese restaurant in Queens. He earns $4,000 a month, slightly more than what he earned as a business owner in the coastal Chinese province of Guangdong. Next to him, a woman in a pearl-colored puffer jacket, who asked to remain anonymous because she works illegally in the country, said the US was not what she had imagined. She joked that China\u2019s infrastructure bests what she has seen in New York. \u201cFrom movies I watched when I was younger, I remembered Chinatowns being bustling and beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after coming here, I found that Chinatown is in a state of\u202f\u200b\u200bdisrepair. It\u2019s broken and dirty. I was so surprised,\u201d she said as the room burst out in laughter. When asked why she has chosen to remain in the US, she replied: \u201cBecause the US is actually more powerful, despite sometimes the broken appearance,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not starving in China, but everyone wants a better life. Obviously, America is better.\u201d Anti-China measures Both China and US authorities have been concerned with the uptick in migration to the southern border \u2013 but for entirely different reasons. A Chinese government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to comment publicly, told CNN that they believed some new Chinese migrants are participating in violent anti-China demonstrations in the US to help with their asylum cases.\u00a0The official pointed to clashes between anti-China protesters and pro-China supporters in San Francisco in November, when Chinese leader Xi Jinping was attending a forum in the city. In the US, a\u202frecord number\u202fof migrants at the southern border has been seized upon by Republicans who claim it as proof of the Biden administration\u2019s impotence, pushing immigration control to a top election issue. While most migrants at the southern border hail from Latin American countries, some politicians have focused on Chinese migration as a security concern; Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, claimed last May that some Chinese migrants at the border had military experience,\u202faccording to his blog, though he did not offer evidence. Wan Yanhai, a human rights activist based in New York, said the implication that the Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers could be soldiers or spies was \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d There would be little reason for the Chinese government to embed spies among southern border arrivals, he pointed out, considering migrants are not the demographic that would gain access to state secrets in the US. \u201cThese migrants in the US are doing low-level jobs and don\u2019t speak the language, so they can\u2019t do this kind of work. \u2026 It\u2019s impossible for them to be spies.\u201d But the rhetoric around the rise of undocumented Chinese migrants highlights growing tensions between the US and Chinese governments. Geopolitical and security concerns\u202fhave led an increasingly hawkish Biden administration\u202fto unravel years of technological and economic integration with its chief rival in the Pacific. But Jiang, the\u202fasylum\u202fseeker who believes he was blacklisted by Beijing, is unfazed by the growing intergovernmental tensions. \u201cIt\u2019s not really anti-China, it\u2019s anti-Communist Party. I\u2019m also against the Communist Party, I don\u2019t have a good impression of them either, right?\u201d \u2018Deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom\u2019 Wan, a prominent former\u202fHIV activist in China, had to leave the country in 2010 due to harassment by Chinese authorities, he says. He received permanent US residence a year later and has gone on to help Chinese migrants in Flushing. Many of the new arrivals head to the enclave\u2019s unlicensed hostels, he said. He worries that rising hostel prices \u2013 upwards of $20 per night \u2013 could lead to a rise in homelessness, especially for the low-income elderly population in Flushing. Li Jiada lives in one of those hostels, sharing a cramped room with five other men, sparsely decorated except for a calendar hanging above his single bed. Life has not been easy for the 26-year-old, soft-spoken former fashion photographer since he arrived in the US in January. He had spent three months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center after failing an initial screening for\u202fasylum\u202fwhen he crossed the southern border. He was released this year pending deportation proceedings expected within the next year. He initially struggled to find a job in New York. When he found one, he says, he was sexually harassed by a client and has since found a new role as a manicurist, earning $2,000 a month. His costs are higher than what he earns, but he says, \u201cThere\u2019s no regret because coming here has given me more options.\u201d He is desperate to stay in the US and thinks Christianity, which he discovered while in detention, will save him from deportation. The Communist Party\u202fsees any large\u202fgroup outside its dominion as a threat, has banned the online sale of Bibles, and has arrested Christians for \u201cinciting subversion of state power.\u201d \u201cMaybe my only way forward is through Jesus,\u201d he said. Li plans on filing a new\u202fasylum\u202fapplication based on his new-found religion. Sitting in a Baptist church in Flushing, Li spoke about the stress of the looming deportation and thinks back about the first thing he did when he arrived in New York: seeing the Statue of Liberty, a sculpture that has become a symbol of hope for millions of immigrants before him. \u201cAfter the treacherous journey to get here, I needed to see the embodiment of my beliefs: democracy, freedom, equality, and rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US has yet to accept me, but deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom.\u201d The ethnic enclave has largely shielded the migrants CNN spoke to from a recent\u202frise\u202fin anti-Asian crimes in the city. Still, Li thinks he may have been targeted for being Chinese: Someone threw a full can of soda at him as he waited for a train back to Flushing from Manhattan, he said. And like a true New Yorker, he gave the assailant a piece of his mind. \u201cAt that moment, I felt like I could suddenly speak English fluently,\u201d he joked. \u201cMy talent was unleashed, and I said: \u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/americas/new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_asia_thailand-lese-majeste-activist-death-netiporn-intl-hnk", "text": "A young activist jailed for insulting\u00a0Thailand\u2019s monarchy\u00a0died on Tuesday following a prolonged hunger strike, officials said, prompting an outpouring of grief and renewed calls for justice reform in the Southeast Asian kingdom Netiporn \u201cBung\u201d Sanesangkhom, 28, died after suffering a \u201csudden cardiac arrest,\u201d Thailand\u2019s Corrections Department said in a statement. A medical team tried to resuscitate her before transferring her to Bangkok\u2019s Thammasat University Hospital but she \u201cdid not respond to treatment,\u201d the department said. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death, the department added. Netiporn was a member of protest group Thalu Wang, which has pushed\u00a0for reform of Thailand\u2019s powerful monarchy and amendment of the country\u2019s draconian lese majeste law, in which criticizing the king, queen, or heir apparent can lead to a maximum 15-year prison sentence. The group\u2019s name\u00a0loosely translates to \u201cpiercing through the palace,\u201d in reference to its drive to hold the monarchy accountable; it campaigns by holding public opinion polls questioning the monarchy\u2019s power. Netiporn had been part of the nationwide 2020 youth-led protests that saw millions of young Thais take to the streets of major cities calling for constitutional, democratic and military reforms, and, for the first time, openly criticizing the monarchy and publicly questioning its power and wealth. She had been in jail since January 26 and was awaiting trial, according to legal advocacy group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. While in detention, Netiporn went on a 65-day hunger strike until April to protest the jailing of political dissidents without bail, the group said. During this time, she had been moved back and forth to the prison hospital due to her deteriorating health. After Netiporn was sent back to jail on April\u00a04, the Thai Corrections Department said she was able to eat and drink normally, but she was weak and suffered from swollen limbs and anemia. She had refused to take \u201cminerals and anti-anemia supplements,\u201d the department said. The activist faced seven criminal cases, including two lese majeste charges. She previously spent 94 days in jail in 2022 and conducted a hunger strike before being released on bail, which was later revoked. One lese majeste case against her was filed in relation to a 2022 protest where she held up a banner at a busy shopping mall in Bangkok that read: \u201cDid the royal procession cause an inconvenience?\u201d The other lese majeste charge is from a similar 2022 protest where she held a sign asking the public: \u201cDo you agree that the government allows the king to use power as he pleases?\u201d In an open letter Netiporn wrote from jail in March, she said growing up as a judge\u2019s daughter made her realize \u201cthis country doesn\u2019t exist to serve small people\u2019s justice.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a judge\u2019s daughter to understand the scale of the failure in the justice system. Their existence is not for the people, they exist shamelessly for the powers and a few groups of people in this country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBy simply asking question and honking a car, you go to jail.\u201d Calls for reform Netiporn\u2019s death has shocked many in the country and sparked renewed calls for reforms to the judicial system, which allows activists to be denied bail and held in detention for extended periods of time before trial. \u201cThis is a shocking reminder that Thai authorities are harshly denying pro-democracy activists their freedom in an apparent bid to silence the peaceful expression of dissent. Many are currently detained, with their right to temporary release on bail denied,\u201d said Amnesty International in a statement. \u201cThis tragic incident should serve as a wake-up call to Thai authorities to drop charges against and release all human rights defenders and other people who are unjustly detained.\u201d On Tuesday night, supporters held a candlelight vigil outside the Southern\u00a0Bangkok Criminal Court. Those attending included Panusaya \u201cRung\u201d Sithijirawattanakul, a fellow activist who also faces lese majeste charges for her involvement in the 2020 protests. \u201cI feel so shocked. I question myself, did she really die?\u201d Panusaya told CNN Wednesday. \u201cShe didn\u2019t receive any justice for her cases.\u201d Calling on the government of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin to respond to her death, Panusaya demanded the release of all political prisoners in Thailand. \u201cDo we have to have more people die before you will care?\u201d she asked. On Wednesday, Srettha called Netiporn\u2019s death a \u201ctragic incident,\u201d adding he had ordered Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Justice to investigate the circumstances surrounding it. \u201cI would like to convey my condolences to her family. I am confident that we will give justice,\u201d he said. Responding to the calls for the release of all political prisoners, Strettha said, \u201cI believe that the justice minister has heard about the call, and he\u2019s working on looking into the whole legal system. We have to give justice to everyone.\u201d Thailand\u00a0has some of the world\u2019s strictest lese majeste laws and sentences for those convicted under Section 112 of the country\u2019s criminal code,\u00a0can be decades long. Hundreds of people have been\u00a0prosecuted in recent years, including Mongkol Thirakhot, who was sentenced to a record 50 years in prison in January for social media posts deemed damaging to the king. For years,\u00a0human rights organizations\u00a0and free speech campaigners have said lese majeste has been used as a\u00a0political tool\u00a0to silence critics of the Thai government. Rights groups say the right to freedom of expression in Thailand has come under increased attack since the 2020 protests. Despite the change from a military-backed government to civilian leadership last year, surveillance and intimidation against activists and students continues, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. The legal advocacy group said that since the start of those protests in July 2020 and up until March 2024, at least 1,954 people have been prosecuted or charged for their participation in political assemblies and for speaking out, with 286 of those cases involving children. At least 270 people have been charged with lese majeste during that time, the group added. \u201cThe death of Ms. Netiporn is evidence that the problems of political prosecution and detention of pro-democracy activists, especially in l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 cases, are still very much alive under the Pheu Thai government,\u201d the group\u2019s advocacy lead, Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate told CNN. Netiporn\u2019s death comes as Thailand is running for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council and while the Thai government is negotiating a free trade agreement with the European Union, Akarachai added. \u201cThe right to bail must be granted to political detainees who have not been found guilty of any crimes by a final judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe price of fundamental freedoms should not be their lives.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/asia/thailand-lese-majeste-activist-death-netiporn-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_turks-and-caicos-fifth-arrest-ammunition-charges", "text": "Another US tourist was arrested Monday in Turks and Caicos after being accused of carrying ammunition into the islands. That makes this the fifth arrest in recent months of a US national on ammunition possession charges in the British Overseas Territory, a chain of 40 islands located in the tropical Atlantic Ocean southeast of the Bahamas. The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force said in a news release that Sharitta Shinese Grier, 45, of Orlando, Florida, was charged with one count of possession of ammunition after a routine security search at the Howard Hamilton International Airport on the island of Providenciales on May 13. The search found that Grier had ammunition in her possession, the news release said. Grier appeared in the Turks and Caicos Magistrate Court on Thursday and remains in custody until her next court appearance on July 5, police said. CNN has not been able to determine whether Grier has an attorney or to reach her family for comment. Four others face ammo charges Earlier this month, the Turks and Caicos Government released\u00a0a statement\u00a0confirming that four Americans were charged with possession of ammunition offenses. All four are accused of bringing varying amounts of ammunition into the islands, and some have publicly said that they did so accidentally. Carrying firearms in Turks and Caicos is prohibited, according to the TCI Government. Bringing firearms or ammunition, including stray bullets, into the British Overseas Territory without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d Individuals who violate the law face a minimum 12 years in prison, the US Embassy in the Bahamas stated in an April advisory. On May 8, the Turks and Caicos Attorney General\u00a0said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0that judges have discretion to lower the minimum sentence and adjust fines when there are \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d One of the US nationals facing charges, Bryan Hagerich, is expected to be sentenced on May 29, according to a lawyer representing him. Hagerich pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition and was detained at Hamilton International in February. Governors make appeals of mercy Three US governors have\u00a0signed a letter\u00a0addressed to Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam addressing the recent arrests. Govs. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia wrote to their Turks and Caicos counterpart asking her to \u201creconsider the charges\u201d and \u201cexpedite their release\u201d for three of the men arrested \u2013 one from each of the governors\u2019 respective states. \u201cThey have all maintained that they did not intend to bring ammunition into Turks and Caicos,\u201d the three governors wrote in the letter. \u201cWe humbly ask that your government \u2013 in its wisdom \u2013 temper justice with mercy and recognize that these men made mistakes but had no apparent malicious intent.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/turks-and-caicos-fifth-arrest-ammunition-charges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_americas_guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam", "text": "A powerful politician in Guyana has been accused of sexual assault for the second time in less than a year, following his resignation last July over separate allegations. The accuser, economist Sarah Aneesah Hakh, told an online press conference held in the capital Georgetown that former Minister Nigel Dharamlall sexually assaulted her in 2020 and 2021. Hakh said the first alleged incident occurred during a business meeting when Dharamlall was Guyana\u2019s senior minister of regional development. \u201cThe fact that he is still in that party is mind boggling to me,\u201d Hakh said. Dharamlall, a Guyanese politician seen as a power broker in the country, was recently appointed to the executive committee of Guyana\u2019s ruling People\u2019s Progressive Party. He has been photographed recently with Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo. Dharamlall rejected the allegations in a statement posted on his Facebook page, saying \u201cI wish to categorically and most vehemently deny each and every one of the allegations made.\u201d He accused Hakh of being on a \u201ccampaign to tarnish my reputation,\u201d claiming that \u201cher demeanor towards me changed fundamentally after I rebuffed her advances and spurned her attempts to engage in an intimate relationship.\u201d CNN has reached out to Dharamlall for comment and has contacted the office of Guyana President Irfaan Ali. Dharamlall resigned from Guyana\u2019s cabinet and parliament last year after an indigenous teenage girl accused him of rape in an unrelated incident, which he has denied. The girl later withdrew the claim according to officials and no charges were filed, President Ali said\u202fin a video statement\u202flast July. He emphasized at the time that his government had \u201callowed the system to work. We have not intervened; from day one,\u201d apparently referencing public criticism over how the girl\u2019s case was handled by authorities. Her withdrawal however was seen by some as a sign of government corruption, with the public speculating her family had been paid off. In a March statement, Guyanese women\u2019s rights group Red Thread criticized officials for failing the accuser. \u201cIt is of great concern that the public nature of this complaint, the powerful political status of the suspect, the discontinuance of the matter at this early stage and the haste with which this investigation was ended, will reinforce the perception of impunity, and inevitably discourage other victims of sexual violence from coming forward,\u201d it wrote. \u2018Violated against my will\u2019 Hakh, who was seen as a rising star in Guyana, said she was first assaulted by Dharamlall during what was supposed to be a meeting about her taking a role as a regional executive officer in September 2020. She alleged that Dharamlall took the then-25-year-old into his bedroom, disrobed and forcibly performed oral sex on her without her consent in the Anna Regina State House, a town on the country\u2019s coast. Hakh told reporters on Friday that she told Dharamlall to stop several times, saying she is a lesbian and \u201cthis is not something I came here expecting to do and can\u2019t offer anything.\u201d \u201cI was violated against my will by a man who exploited my situation and tried to entrap me in a compromising situation due to my future contract with the ministry,\u201d she said. Hakh also alleged that a second incident took place in 2021, in the Cummings Lodge neighborhood on the outskirts of Georgetown, when she says she met Dharamlall to discuss several grievances she had with the ministry of local government. During their meeting, Hakh alleges Dharamlall tried to remove her clothes. Hakh told CNN she didn\u2019t file a police report in 2020 or 2021 due to fears of police corruption and that she would be shunned publicly and within her family, which she says did business with Dharamlall. \u201cI knew I was going up against something that was dangerous and my whole strategy was that if I made a report that was preemptive, and it didn\u2019t go anywhere, I automatically had no credibility,\u201d she told the press conference on Friday, adding that she finally filed a police report on May 9. Hakh said she also filed cyberbullying charges against Dharamlall on May 8.\u202f CNN has contacted Guyanese police for comment. Hakh said she decided to go public with her allegation because \u201cI need to give victims the strength to know that they\u2019re not alone, and that there is no shame in what happened to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/americas/guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_weather_south-gulf-coast-flooding-texas-climate", "text": "Rounds of fierce storms and gushing rainfall are raising the risk of dangerous flooding late this week for millions in the already-waterlogged South. Double-digit rainfall totals between 20 and 30 inches over the region in recent weeks  have soaked the ground and left rivers swollen, priming the flood threat to extreme levels. More widespread heavy rain Thursday and Friday is only going to make matters worse. The forecast calling for extreme rainfall rates and repeated rounds of storms is creating a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d for the Gulf Coast, according to the Weather Prediction Center. \u201cSignificant and considerable flash flooding is likely\u00a0as a result, as multiple inches of rain fall in a matter of a few hours.\u201d A Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall that could trigger flash flooding is in place from eastern Texas, through Louisiana and into western Mississippi Thursday, according to the WPC. An upgrade to a rare Level 4 of 4 high risk of flooding rainfall is possible by early Thursday as which areas are most at risk becomes clearer. High risk days are exceedingly rare but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the US. Timing out the significant flood threat Storms, some of which may become severe, are likely to rumble to life Thursday afternoon in parts of Texas and push south and east to reach Louisiana and Mississippi late in the day. Rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour are possible in the heaviest storms. The greatest flooding danger Thursday will come as storms begin to train. Training storms track through and deluge the same areas over and over, like a train pulling its cars over the same stretch of track. Serious flash flooding is likely in any areas caught under multiple storms unloading 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour. Roadways may quickly become rivers and small streams could easily overflow their banks. Soaking storms will shift east on Friday and target more of the Gulf Coast. Much of southern Mississippi and southern Alabama are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall on Friday. A larger area from the Texas/Louisiana border to Florida and Georgia is under a Level 2 of 4 risk. Drenching storms from Thursday night will likely last into Friday morning for parts of the Gulf Coast. An initial round of flash flooding is likely in the first half of Friday before rain starts to taper off in the afternoon. Another bout of heavy rain will develop Friday night and work over the same areas hit earlier in the day. These storms could also produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, and quickly restart or \u201cgreatly worsen\u201d any ongoing flooding, according to the WPC. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas into Georgia through Friday night. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up more than half a foot of rain. One of the wettest years to date The upcoming rain will only add to already impressive rainfall totals in what\u2019s been one of the wettest years to date on record across the Gulf Coast. Some Southeast cities have recorded more than half a foot of rain above what\u2019s typical for the first several months of the year. Several dozen cities from Texas to western Georgia are pacing at a top 5 wettest year to date and at least two cities in eastern Texas are experiencing their wettest year, according to the Southeast Regional Climate Center. Dallas is experiencing its third-wettest year to date, while Shreveport, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, are amid their second wettest. Excessive rainfall has largely eliminated dryness and drought conditions along the Gulf Coast, but is hasn\u2019t come without a cost. Earlier this month, nearly 2 feet of rain fell in just five days and sent parts of eastern Texas underwater. Hundreds of people and animals were rescued from flooding as some area rivers rose to levels not reached since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/weather/south-gulf-coast-flooding-texas-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_americas_venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam", "text": "Venezuela continues to build up military infrastructure and hardware close to the border with Guyana as President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters scale up their threats to annex an\u00a0oil-rich piece of Guyanese land. In a report shared with CNN, the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that while the Venezuelan government \u201chas little to gain and much to lose from a full-blown conflict\u201d it continues to play \u201ca dangerous game\u201d over its claim over the densely forested Essequibo region. \u201cThe constant drumbeat asserting \u2018the Essequibo is ours,\u2019 alongside the creation of new military commands and legal structures to oversee the defense of the region, is helping to institutionalize a sense of perpetual prewar footing,\u201d it wrote. Tension over the region, which amounts to about two-thirds of Guyanese national territory, mounted last year after a Venezuelan referendum in which voters assented to creating\u00a0a Venezuelan state within the disputed region. Guyana had called the move a step towards annexation and an \u201cexistential\u201d threat as the specter of armed conflict loomed over the region. CNN previously reported in February about an expansion of operations at Venezuela\u2019s Anacoco Island military base despite both countries agreeing in December to pursue a diplomatic avenue to resolve the conflict. Using satellite imagery and social media, CSIS found that the expansion of Anacoco Island\u2019s military base has continued. A bridge is seen being built across the Cuyuni River to connect the Venezuelan riverbank to the island, which has been a point of contention between the countries after it was awarded to Guyana in an 1899 ruling by an international tribunal. Venezuela annexed it in the 1960s. The island\u2019s airfield has expanded and now includes a small control tower, CSIS writes. Satellite imagery from March showed an area next to the airfield with more than 75 field tents, \u201cenough for a battalion-sized unit of several hundred personnel.\u201d The field tents have since been relocated to the southern side of the airfield \u201cdemonstrating the base\u2019s continued ability to provide logistics and resupply for a sizeable military force continuously for over a month,\u201d it wrote. Meanwhile, by the coast, at least two Iranian-built\u00a0Peykaap III (Zolfaghar) fast missile boats are seen at Venezuela\u2019s small coast guard station at Punta Barima, \u201cplacing Venezuelan missiles and naval forces within arm\u2019s reach of the Guyana-administered Essequibo\u201d as it just 40 miles (64 kilometers) from the Guyanese border. Maduro could \u2018fall victim to own rhetoric\u2019 The threats to Guyana have concerned its partners. Last week, two US Navy F/A-18 fighter jets flew over the capital Georgetown, demonstrating \u201cour routine security cooperation and expanding bilateral defense partnership with Guyana,\u201d the US Embassy in Guyana wrote. While smaller than Idaho, Guyana is home to vast oil reserves and is on track to become the world\u2019s highest per capita oil producer. It, however, has an army estimated to be less than 5,000 soldiers, and lacks the hardware or manpower to face possible Venezuelan aggression. All things considered, \u201cif you\u2019re if you\u2019re Guyana, and your army is 5,000 people, it doesn\u2019t seem like the Venezuelans are taking their foot off the gas,\u201d Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program\u00a0at CSIS and lead author of the report, told CNN. There has been speculation that the upcoming Venezuelan elections at the end of July have given Maduro the motivation to escalate against Guyana, using it as a way to distract from his record: Millions of people have fled the country due to poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care. CSIS argues that instead of tamping down the aggression after the vote, \u201cMaduro may be tempted to ramp up both rhetoric and action related to the Essequibo in a true gambit to manufacture a regional crisis in the aftermath of a stolen election.\u201d It may not be in Maduro\u2019s interest to \u201cinitiate a full-blown conflict with neighbor Guyana, but his escalatory rhetoric tethers his political reputation and legitimacy to his willingness to back his words with force\u201d especially with his key internal ally, the armed forces, CSIS writes. \u201cThus, one of the most concerning possibilities is that Maduro will fall victim to his own rhetoric. He has whipped up nationalist passions without providing an escape valve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/americas/venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_europe-investigation-meta-child-safety", "text": "The European Union is worried that Meta is failing to protect children on its platforms, Facebook and Instagram, and has launched a formal investigation that could result in a hefty fine. The probe is the latest evidence that regulators are increasingly focussing on the harmful impact of Meta\u2019s platforms \u2014 and other social media \u2014 on young users, including by encouraging addictive behavior. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, will consider whether Meta (META) has complied with its obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA), the bloc\u2019s sweeping new law for online platforms. The legislation requires online platforms to put in place measures to protect children, including by preventing them from accessing inappropriate content and ensuring a high level of privacy and safety. Non-compliance could result in companies being fined as much as 6% of their global revenue or being forced to change their software. The European Commission is concerned that Facebook\u2019s and Instagram\u2019s online interfaces \u201cmay exploit\u00a0the weaknesses and inexperience of minors\u00a0and cause\u00a0addictive behavior,\u201d it said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThe Commission is also concerned about age assurance and verification methods put in place by Meta,\u201d it added, noting that these may not be effective. In a statement shared with CNN, a spokesperson for Meta responded: \u201cWe want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them. This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.\u201d A report the company submitted to the European Commission last September, detailing how its platforms protect minors, was not enough to assuage regulators\u2019 concerns. \u201cWe are not convinced that (Meta) has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans,\u201d Commissioner Thierry Breton, said in the statement. \u201cWe are sparing no effort to protect our children.\u201d Meta has faced growing scrutiny over the impact of its platforms on young users in recent years. The social media giant has been sued by various US school districts and state attorney generals in lawsuits related to youth mental health, child safety and privacy. Earlier this month, an investigation by the New Mexico attorney general into the potential dangers of Meta\u2019s platforms resulted in the arrests of three men charged with attempted sexual abuse of children. Meta has also been frequently caught in the crosshairs of EU regulators, including over its handling of advertising by scammers and foreign election meddlers ahead of upcoming EU elections, as well as over disinformation and illegal content on its platforms linked to the war in Gaza.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/europe-investigation-meta-child-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_lynn-rippelmeyer-first-female-747-pilot", "text": "Lynn Rippelmeyer\u2019s reach for the sky started from an unlikely place. \u201cI grew up on a farm in the 1950s. There were no women flying, there were no female airline pilots. I had an interest in aviation because there were airplanes flying overhead, and I thought how much fun it would be to see the world from up there. The closest I could come to pretending that was riding my horse up to the top of these limestone bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River, about a mile away from the farm, and imagine that the horse had wings \u2014 like Pegasus \u2014 and could soar and fly over the fields.\u201d So, she did the next best thing: become a flight attendant. She got hired in 1972 by TWA, then a major airline, and started working on the Queen of the Skies, the Boeing 747: \u201cIt had just come out, and TWA was one of the first airlines to fly it. I loved how it looked,\u201d she says. However, she was mostly curious about how it worked: \u201cIf I started asking questions about what was going on in the cockpit and asked [the flight crew] about their jobs and the airplane, we could have an almost intelligent adult conversation, and I could sit up there and enjoy it, so that\u2019s what I did.\u201d At the time, flight crews on large aircraft were made up of two pilots plus a flight engineer, who was easier to talk to because his seat was positioned behind those of the pilots. So, Rippelmeyer says, she could ask even more questions and learn even more about switches, hydraulics and engines. The next summer, she got serious about her passion and started taking flying lessons in Vermont, on a small Piper seaplane: \u201cI just loved it. It was the closest I\u2019ve ever been to being addicted to anything.\u201d In 1975, she learned that the first two female airline pilots in the United States \u2013 Bonnie Tiburzi at American Airlines and Emily Warner at Frontier \u2013 had been hired. Encouraged, she started the career pilot program for the role of flight engineer in Miami. She obtained her first commercial license in 1976. A historic moment, kept secret Rippelmeyer\u2019s first cockpit job came just a year later with a small commuter airline, Air Illinois, as first officer on a Twin Otter \u2014 a 20-passenger turboprop regional plane. The airline already had a female captain in its ranks, but upon hiring Rippelmeyer, the owner told her that they would be never flying together. \u201cI asked why, and he said, \u2018Well, we have to have a man up there in case anything goes wrong, don\u2019t we? And we also don\u2019t want to scare our passengers away, do we?\u2019 Because he was the owner, he could make whatever rules he wanted. And at that time, there was no law or regulation against it, so we just went with it.\u201d However, with only three airplanes and about 20 pilots, keeping the two women from flying together was a scheduling nightmare. \u201cOne day, we just had to \u2014 Emilie, the captain, was already there, but her first officer was sick and there was nobody else that could get to the airplane on time but me,\u201d Rippelmeyer said. She had the dispatcher call the owner of the airline and heard him screaming through the phone: \u201cHe said I could take the flight, but we couldn\u2019t make any announcements and we had to keep the cockpit door closed. Nobody had to know there were two women in there. So that\u2019s what we did.\u201d It was December 30, 1977, and that was the first scheduled flight in the United States with an all-female crew \u2013 but it was kept a secret. At least, \u201csince nobody died,\u201d Lippenmeyer says, the two were no longer intentionally kept apart and flew together many more times. However, her days at Air Illinois were numbered: \u201cThe pay for being a first-year pilot wasn\u2019t even enough to make rent,\u201d she says. To make ends meet, she was still working as a flight attendant, resulting in a grueling schedule: \u201cI couldn\u2019t do both. I tried for about a month and there should be a rule against it. But at Air Illinois, I had a goal: I needed 1,000 hours of gas-turbine flight time. And once I had that, there really wasn\u2019t any more reason to hang out there.\u201d Too short to be a pilot? With enough flight experience in her pocket, Rippelmeyer could take a crack at bigger airlines. One of them \u2014 the now defunct Ozark Air Lines \u2014 rejected her at the end of the interview process because, they said, at 5\u20194\u201d she was too short to be a pilot: \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t, but again, they could make whatever rules they wanted.\u201d She got hired by TWA as a flight engineer, flying on the Boeing 727. The airline had two other female pilots, and they got along well. However, they all got furloughed just a week short of being off probation: \u201cYou can\u2019t wait to get off probation, because your salary doubles \u2014 the first year at any airline is poverty,\u201d she says. It was a blessing in disguise. Rippelmeyer found a job at a cargo carrier called Seaboard World Airlines \u2013 as first officer on the Boeing 747, flying out of JFK on transatlantic routes. \u201cIt was a very unique situation, because in most airlines, you started as a flight engineer \u2013 like I did at TWA \u2013 and then you worked your way up,\u201d she says. \u201cBut at Seaboard, they had professional engineers. Guys that did not have a pilot license and didn\u2019t care about upgrading to pilot. So when you got hired as a pilot, you immediately went to the first officer seat.\u201d The year was 1980, and Rippelmeyer had just become the first female pilot to fly the 747. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think a woman could do that,\u201d she says, because the male pilots she had worked with had told her it would be too difficult \u2013 psychologically and physically. \u201cThey had kind of convinced me there was a physical aspect to it. They told me that on four-engine airplanes, if two engines went out on one side, no woman would have the strength to push the rudder down to keep the airplane flying straight.\u201d But Captain Carl Hirschberg, an experienced pilot who was her superior and flight instructor, was excited about having a 747 female pilot and told her that she could. Better yet, he showed her how to do it. \u201cIn the simulator one day, he said we\u2019d have an engine failure on takeoff, and then a second failure on the same side. And that\u2019s not supposed to happen. It never happens. The first officer doesn\u2019t have to demonstrate that. But I didn\u2019t have time to think about it \u2014 I just had to deal with it.\u201d \u201cI came back around and landed with the two engines out. And it wasn\u2019t as good as he could have done it, but I managed it. My leg, from pushing on the rudder so hard for two engines, was just shaking. I couldn\u2019t stand up. Why would you do that to me? And he said, \u2018Because I\u2019m not having you up there thinking you can\u2019t do something that you can. And you\u2019re welcome.\u2019 \u201d Breaking records The dream didn\u2019t last long, because Rippelmeyer was furloughed once again: \u201cI was 30 years old at this point, didn\u2019t have a job, wasn\u2019t married, didn\u2019t have an income. Flying was not working out. I was wondering if I had messed up my life.\u201d Luckily, the deregulation of airlines \u2014 which removed federal control over routes and fares \u2014 led to an influx of newcomers on the market, and among these was an airline called People Express, which flew from 1981 to 1987: \u201cI started out as a first officer on the 737 and since I got hired at the very beginning, it was less than a year before I became a captain. I got to be one of the very first female airline captains in the world.\u201d Later, People Express started flying the Boeing 747s and in 1984, Rippelmeyer became the first woman to captain a jumbo on a transoceanic flight, from Newark to London Gatwick. \u201cBeautiful weather, lovely ride, nice landing. I walked through the cabin and people were congratulating me. There were all kinds of celebrations, TV, radio and photographers waiting for the arrival. Everybody was very, very gracious and wonderful about it. It was quite something,\u201d she says. Rippelmeyer briefly flew the Boeing 727 before People Express was acquired by Continental in 1987. The uncertainty that came with the merger caused her to take time off to go sailing through French Polynesia and then settle in California to marry and have children. After a hiatus of almost 10 years, a divorce and a move to Texas, she returned to the skies in 1998, finding ingenious ways to balance family and work life. \u201cMy two sons and I moved to Houston where Continental had a base. I returned to flying domestically on the 737 to be able to be home with my children more. The kids were only 3 and 7. Initially, I thought I needed to find a live-in nanny,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there was this one flight to Tegucigalpa, Honduras, that checked in at 9 a.m. and got back at 4 p.m. \u2014 so I would be able to drop the kids off at school, go to work and pick them back up. It was a difficult approach into the airport, which required extra training. It\u2019s a visual-only landing onto a short runway at a high altitude surrounded by mountains and has no electronic guidance. The chief pilot called me to ask why in the world I wanted to fly into the most dangerous airport we had. I told him it matched my kids\u2019 school schedule.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s what I flew for the better part of 12 years until the kids were old enough, and it worked out great. I could drop them off at school and get to the airport and fly to Central America - it\u2019s only two and a half hours from Houston. It was fun once you got used to it.\u201d Grounded Rippelmeyer\u2019s flights to Tegucigalpa also led to what she calls her \u201cretirement job\u201d \u2013 helping the people of Roatan, an island off the coast of Honduras. After meeting missionaries on board her flights, she began bringing in supplies donated by friends and family. She then created a nonprofit called ROSE (Roatan Support Effort) to support clinics, schools, community kitchens, sports programs and an animal shelter. Her last flight as a pilot took off in 2013 on a Boeing 787 with United Airlines, which had merged with Continental Airlines the previous year. \u201cMy first 747 flight was to London and then my last 787 flight was to London,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a perfect flight. The crew was fantastic. The layover was great. The weather in London was beautiful. And I thought, this is as good as it gets \u2013 and for the first time, I\u2019d rather be doing something else. My heart was in Honduras with the nonprofit. So, when I got back, I told the chief pilot that I wanted to retire.\u201d Rippelmeyer, who has written two memoirs \u2013 titled \u201cLife Takes Wings\u201d and \u201cLife Takes Flight\u201d \u2013 is nostalgic about the 747 and never quite warmed up to the more modern 787, which she calls \u201ca flying computer\u201d that is repaired with a laptop rather than a toolkit. \u201cIt\u2019s pieces of electronic equipment talking to other pieces of electronic equipment, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt usually works. It\u2019s much lighter in weight and uses less fuel, which is fantastic. Maybe I just never flew her long enough to be attached to her the way I was with the 747.\u201d She reckons that things have improved for women\u2019s careers in aviation: \u201cNow all women who want to be airline pilots have that opportunity. Aviation schools and airlines are accepting female applicants just as willingly as males. I don\u2019t see any discrimination against women any longer,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe if there is any left, it\u2019s because there are still some old schools of thoughts that say a woman should be home with her children. But I think that\u2019s gradually going to change.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/lynn-rippelmeyer-first-female-747-pilot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_mohamed-amra-france-prison-attack-intl", "text": "A rare episode of violence disrupted the peaceful region of Normandy in northern France on Tuesday when gunmen ambushed a prison convoy to spring a notorious prison inmate known as \u201cThe Fly.\u201d The attack took place while prisoner Mohamed Amra, 30, was being transported from a court hearing in Rouen to a nearby prison in \u00c9vreux, and has led to a massive manhunt. The prison convoy was driving on a motorway when it came under heavy gunfire, resulting in the deaths of two prison guards, while three others were seriously injured. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the escaped inmate, as a search involving hundreds of police officers enters its second day. \u2018Well known\u2019 to authorities Mohamed Amra, nicknamed \u201cLa Mouche\u201d or \u201cThe Fly,\u201d is \u201cvery well known\u201d to the French justice system having sustained a total of 13 convictions, according to Paris state prosecutor Laure Beccuau. A judicial court in Marseilles is currently investigating Amra for a string of offenses including complicity in premeditated murder in an organized gang, complicity in kidnapping and the taking of hostages, according to Beccuau. CNN\u2019s affiliate in France, BFMTV, reports that the 30-year-old is a suspected narcotics boss. Amra\u2019s lawyer, Hugues Vivier, disputes this, saying there had been nothing to alert authorities to his client having a \u201cparticularly dangerous\u201d profile. Beccuau told journalists that Amra\u2019s criminal record does not contain any convictions for drug-related offenses. Most of his convictions relate to incidents of theft with aggravated offenses, Beccuau said, adding that he had been incarcerated in various facilities since January 2022. On May 10,\u00a0Amra\u00a0was found guilty on the charge of burglary by a court in \u00c9vreux, resulting in a prison sentence of 18 months. He is also under investigation in Marseille for a kidnap which led to a death, Beccuau said. As part of his statement last night, Beccuau said that Amra had been placed under security level three - meaning he was not a high-security prisoner. This is why only five officers were involved in escorting him from the court back to prison. Amra, who was born in the city of Rouen in northern France, was first convicted by authorities in October 2009 aged 15 years old, according to Beccuau. It is understood that Amra had attempted to escape from \u00c9vreux prison two days prior to the ambush. Speaking to BFMTV, Emmanuel Baudin, a union leader of prison guards, said: \u201cWe know that he tried to escape two or three days ago by sawing off the bars of his cell. So colleagues moved him to a disciplinary unit.\u201d In an interview on French radio, Amra\u2019s mother said she broke down crying when she heard about the deadly ambush. \u201cI broke down, I cried.\u00a0Really I wasn\u2019t well. How can lives be taken like that? It makes me sick \u2026\u00a0It\u2019s serious,\u201d she told France\u2019s RTL radio network. Manhunt underway A massive manhunt has been launched to find Amra and the gunmen who carried out the prison break. Interpol put out a red notice \u2013 a request for worldwide law enforcement officials to locate and provisionally arrest that person \u2013 for Amra. It is not, as Interpol points out, an international arrest warrant. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on X he has mobilized the national gendarmerie and \u201cseveral hundred\u201d police officers for the manhunt. French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told reporters that the incident was the first time a French prison employee has died while working since 1992. French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X that \u201cevery effort is being made to find the perpetrators of this crime so that justice can be done in the name of the French people.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/europe/mohamed-amra-france-prison-attack-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_world_cotton-candy-exoplanet-discovery-wasp-193b-scn", "text": "What is big, with a fluffy,\u00a0cotton candy-like composition? Turns out, a planet. An international coalition of astronomers has newly discovered an unusual planet, dubbed WASP-193b, that\u2019s about 50% bigger than Jupiter and somehow still the second lightest planet ever found. But WASP-193b, located beyond our solar system about 1,200 light-years from Earth, isn\u2019t just a scientific oddity. The exoplanet could also be key to future research investigating atypical planetary formation, according to a study describing the find that published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy. This cotton candy planet isn\u2019t alone; there are other similar planets belonging to a class scientists facetiously call \u201cpuffy Jupiters.\u201d The lightest planet ever discovered is the superpuffy Kepler 51d, which is nearly the size of Jupiter but a hundred times lighter than the gas giant. Puffy Jupiters have largely been a mystery for 15 years, said lead study author Khalid Barkaoui. But WASP-193b, because of its size, is an ideal candidate for further analysis by the James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories. \u201cThe planet is so light that it\u2019s difficult to think of an analogous, solid-state material,\u201d said Barkaoui, a postdoctoral researcher of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a news release. \u201cThe reason why it\u2019s close to cotton candy is because both are mostly made of light gases rather than solids. The planet is basically super fluffy.\u201d Low-density planet presents big challenge WASP-193b, which researchers think is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, was a huge puzzle for researchers to piece together. Because the exoplanet\u2019s density is so light for its size, calculating its mass became a challenge. Usually, scientists determine mass using a technique called radial velocity, in which researchers analyze how a star\u2019s spectrum, a graph that indicates the intensity of light emissions in wavelengths, shifts as a planet orbits it. The bigger the planet, the more the star\u2019s spectrum can shift \u2014 but this didn\u2019t work for WASP-193b, which is so light, it didn\u2019t make any pull on the star that the team could detect. Because of how small the mass signal was, it took the team four years to gather data and calculate WASP-193b\u2019s mass, Barkaoui explained. Because the extremely low numbers they found were so rare, the researchers completed multiple trials of data analysis, just to be sure. \u201cWe were initially getting extremely low densities, which were very difficult to believe in the beginning,\u201d said co-lead author Francisco Pozuelos, a senior researcher at Spain\u2019s Institute of Astrophysics of Andalucia, in a news release. Eventually the team discovered the planet\u2019s mass is a measly 14% that of Jupiter, despite being so much bigger. But a bigger size means a bigger \u201cextended atmosphere,\u201d said study coauthor Julien de Wit, an associate professor of planetary science at MIT. That means WASP-193b provides an especially useful window into these puffy planets\u2019 formation. \u201cThe bigger a planet\u2019s atmosphere, the more light can go through,\u201d de Wit told CNN. \u201cSo it\u2019s clear that this planet is one of the best targets we have for studying atmospheric effects. It will be a Rosetta Stone to try and resolve the mystery of puffy Jupiters.\u201d But it\u2019s also not clear how WASP-193b even formed, Barkaoui said. The \u201cclassical evolution models\u201d of gas giants don\u2019t quite explain the phenomenon. \u201cWASP-193b is an outlier of all planets discovered to date,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/world/cotton-candy-exoplanet-discovery-wasp-193b-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_europe_russia-ukraine-cross-border-kharkiv-intl", "text": "Russian forces\u00a0have made two cross-border assaults inside northern Ukraine, according to information from Ukrainian sources and officials, in what President Volodymyr Zelensky is calling a \u201cnew wave of counteroffensive actions\u201d by Russia. In the first development, Russian soldiers\u00a0penetrated\u00a0at least one kilometer towards the town of Vovchansk, a Ukrainian military source told CNN. The aim, the source said, \u201cwas to get 10 km deep and create a buffer zone at the border to secure Russian territory from feeling the war.\u201d In an official statement, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Russian soldiers supported by armored vehicles had moved across the border at about 5 a.m. Friday, following a day of stepped-up attacks on the border area with guided aerial bombs and artillery. The statement added that Ukrainian reserve units had been deployed to strengthen defenses in the area. On Saturday, local authorities said more than 20 air glide KAB bombs had been launched at the town and its surrounding settlements. The region\u2019s governor Oleh Syniehubov said two civilians were killed when the bombs hit private houses. A second Ukrainian source with direct knowledge of frontline developments told CNN that Russian forces had also penetrated 5 kilometers inside Ukraine towards the village of Krasne, which lies about 75 km along the border, west of Vovchansk. The source said the Russian ground assault towards Krasne was carried out by four Russian battalions - about 2,000 men. Ukrainian officials have not given much information about the second Russian push, though Ukraine\u2019s General Staff, in its Friday evening update, did note Russian attacks in the area of Krasne and two neighboring villages. It is also noteworthy that DeepStateMap, a Ukrainian monitoring group which updates frontline developments daily, showed four villages next to each other - including Krasne - in the grey area, representing territory currently contested rather than under full Ukrainian control. DeepStateMap also noted on its Telegram channel that the number of Russian forces deployed in the two cross-border pushes was not enough for a deeper advance into Ukrainian territory, but it also drew attention to the fact Moscow has many more troops positioned along the border - estimated to be around 40,000. Asked about developments, Zelensky did not downplay their seriousness but said Ukraine\u2019s military had been expecting such a move. \u201cRussia launched a new wave of counteroffensive actions in [northern Kharkiv region]. Ukraine met them there with our troops, brigades and artillery,\u201d he told reporters early Friday afternoon. \u201cBut our military and military command were aware of this and anticipated their forces to meet the enemy with fire. Now there is a fierce battle in this area [\u2026] I think as of now we have stopped the enemy with artillery fire,\u201d Zelensky said. In an address Saturday evening local time, Zelensky said Ukraine was \u201cstrengthening our positions\u201d and adding forces to the Kharkiv region. Residents of border villages have been told to evacuate by authorities. National police posted photos and a video on social media showing officers helping people pack their belongings into police vehicles ahead of being driven to safer locations. A total of 1,775 people have so far been evacuated from Kharkiv region, a day after Russia\u2019s surprise assault, the head of the region\u2019s military administration said Saturday. The developments mark the most serious cross-border ground assault by Russia since Ukraine re-captured the northern Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022, after it was first taken by Russia in the opening weeks of its full-scale invasion. It also comes after several months of increased Russian air attacks on the city of Kharkiv, which have knocked out all the city\u2019s power-generating capacity, as well as its sub-stations. Governor Syniehubov insisted the latest Russian ground assaults did not put the city, which lies just 30 km south from the Russian border, under heightened risk. \u201cThe enemy group does not pose a threat to Kharkiv city, its forces are only enough for provocations in the northern direction.\u201d However, analysts note that if Russian forces were able to push much further south, that could bring the northern edge of the city within range of Russian artillery, which can fire about 20 km.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/europe/russia-ukraine-cross-border-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_africa_meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours. Their first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital\u00a0of\u00a0Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy. There, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the\u00a0GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products. The pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the\u00a0Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for \u201cwelcoming me home.\u201d Despite the private nature of their visit, the couple\u2019s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020. They were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including\u00a0a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum. For both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight. It was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country\u2019s standing in the eyes of the UK\u2019s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world. Nigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest.\u00a0However, it is a huge country \u2014\u00a0 larger than the US state of Texas\u00a0 \u2014 and the other areas\u00a0visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe. Meanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing\u00a0their official royal duties. It was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb. Meghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry\u00a0after discovering several years ago\u00a0that she is 43% Nigerian\u00a0through a genealogy test. On Saturday, she co-hosted a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture. During a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess\u00a0spoke passionately about uncovering\u00a0her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity. She described Nigeria as \u201cmy country,\u201d adding\u00a0that \u201cbeing African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting \u2026 to discover more and understand what that really means.\u201d It was here that Meghan\u2019s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted\u00a0effortlessly with attendees, posed\u00a0for selfies and engaged\u00a0in heartfelt conversations. At another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos\u00a0- where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the couple\u00a0-\u00a0she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles. The Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan \u201cAda Mazi,\u201d which means \u201cthe daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.\u201d While, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria,\u00a0Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of \u201cAdetokunbo\u201d which means \u201croyalty from across the seas.\u201d Their engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions:\u00a0sports rehabilitation,\u00a0mental health, and women\u2019s empowerment. For Harry\u2019s part, the duke\u00a0demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja. His first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet.\u00a0Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a \u201csymbol of courage,\u201d and \u201cpraised his service to his country.\u201d He added, \u201cPlease give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.\u201d Harry toured about six wards at the Nigerian Army Reference\u00a0Hospital and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram, or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by photographer Misan Harriman, showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed resonated deeply and went viral on social media. Corporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who\u00a0asked him about his rehab. \u201cAre you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?\u2026 We will see you there,\u201d Harry said. Their visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club. Polo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors. Amid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria\u2019s warm reception.\u00a0As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to come back!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/africa/meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_sport_xander-schauffele-pga-championship-score-record-spt-intl", "text": "Only four times in the history of all four men\u2019s major championships has a golfer shot 62. Xander Schauffele is now responsible for the last two. For the second time in less than a year, the American shot the lowest round score in a major\u2019s history on Thursday, blitzing around Valhalla Golf Club to fly into an early three shot lead at the PGA Championship in Kentucky. The world No.3 poured in nine birdies en route to a bogey-free nine-under 62, a course record and the best ever shot across the 106 editions of the event after 18 previous 63\u2019s. Schauffele opened with the same number at the 126th US Open last June, levelling the tournament\u2019s best ever score less than 30 minutes after compatriot Rickie Fowler had set a new low. \u201cI\u2019ll take a 62 in any major any day,\u201d Schauffele told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a great start to a big tournament. One I\u2019m obviously always going to take \u2026 there\u2019s always shots you can kind of pick apart or chips that you can pick apart that you felt like you could have hit better, but I\u2019m very content with how I played.\u201d Branden Grace is the only other player to have shot as low at a major, the South African breaking the Open Championship record during the third round at Royal Birkdale in Southport, England in 2017. Ominously though, none of those three historic feats ended in silverware, a fate Schauffele will be desperate to avoid as he chases a long-awaited first major crown. The 30-year-old is a seven-time PGA Tour winner and regularly challenges for the game\u2019s biggest prizes, recording 12-top 10 major finishes, but risks joining the unwanted ranks of the most talented to never win one of the flagship events should his run of near-misses continue. He has finished as a major runner-up twice \u2013 at the 2018 Open Championship and the 2019 Masters \u2013 and suffered the same agony at the hands of world No. 2 Rory McIlroy at last week\u2019s Wells Fargo Championship. Playing some of the best golf of his career this season, Schauffele is itching to cash in that form for a Wanamaker Trophy come Sunday. \u201cI think not winning makes you want to win more, as weird as that is,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, at least, I react to it, and I want it more and more and more, and it makes me want to work harder and harder and harder. \u201cThe top feels far away and I feel like I have a lot of work to do, but just slowly chipping away at it.\u201d Scheffler enters with eagle Scottie Scheffler is as likely as any to extend Schauffele\u2019s wait, and made a start that surpassed even his unparalleled expectations. Playing his very first hole since becoming a father last week, the dominant world No.1 took just two swings to complete the opening par-four, holing out for eagle from 167 yards. Scheffler shot 67 to pen the latest positive chapter in the unfolding story of a truly remarkable year. The 27-year-old is chasing a fifth win in six starts and a second consecutive major crown after cruising to victory at The Masters last month. \u201cI\u2019d like to clean up a few of the mistakes,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI missed two putts I felt like I should have holed today, but that\u2019s going to happen when the greens get a little chewed up. \u201cI felt like there was a couple things I can clean up going into tomorrow, but overall today was a solid round.\u201d Tiger Woods had looked on course to make a solid start of his own at his 23rd PGA Championship, only for a closing pair of sloppy three putts to drop him to one-over 72. The four-time champion signed off with back-to-back bogeys, leaving him with work to do if he is to follow up his record-breaking 24th consecutive Masters cut with another major weekend outing. \u201cYou have to just grind it out. It\u2019s a marathon. Major championships are a long grind \u2026 it\u2019s not a sprint,\u201d the 48-year-old said Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t win a tournament unless you make the cut. That\u2019s the whole idea is get to the weekend so that you can participate and have a chance to win. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the cut number and have won tournaments, or I\u2019ve been ahead and leading tournaments and I\u2019ve won tournaments.\u201d American duo Tony Finau and Sahith Theegala lead the chasing pack behind Schauffele after shooting 66, one shot ahead of in-form Northern Irishman McIlroy and his Scottish Ryder Cup teammate Robert MacIntyre. Defending champion Brooks Koepka was among those to shoot 67 as he hunts a fourth PGA Championship win, two strokes better than grand slam chasing compatriot Jordan Spieth. Friday\u2019s second round begins at 7:15 a.m. ET (12:15 p.m. BST), with leader Schauffele teeing off at 1:18 p.m. ET (6:15 p.m. BST).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/sport/xander-schauffele-pga-championship-score-record-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-most-spectacular-airport-landings", "text": "There\u2019s a lot to love about travel. Experiencing a new culture. Eating great food. Staying in top notch hotels\u2026 and landing in a new airport. Of course, not all airports are created equal. Some have incredible amenities. Some provide easy access into town. Some make connections a dream. And some have truly dreamy approaches. There are plenty of spectacular landing strips around, but often the best known are located in out-of-the-way destinations. So here we\u2019ve put together some of the most beautiful approaches in major destinations \u2013 along with which side of the aircraft you should sit to best appreciate them. Rio de Janeiro (SDU) Roller coastering over hills, backed by lush mountains, and fringed by slashes of sandy beaches and the Atlantic Ocean beyond, Rio has one of the most naturally beautiful settings in the world. While international flights land at Gale\u00e3o International Airport, outside the city center, Santos Dumont \u2013 the city\u2019s smaller airport \u2013 serves many domestic destinations (including shuttle flights to S\u00e3o Paulo). Not only is it in the city center, but it\u2019s right in Guanabara Bay, on reclaimed land, making for incredible views as you come in or out. Try the right hand side for a glimpse of Rio\u2019s icons, including Sugarloaf Mountain. Sit on the right Mal\u00e9 (VIA) You\u2019d expect a spectacular approach into the Maldives; and that\u2019s what you get here at Velana International Airport, just offshore from Mal\u00e9 on the island of Hulhul\u00e9. When it was first built in the 1960s, it had a runway made of steel slats; these days it\u2019s a standard asphalt surface, though there\u2019s nothing standard about the views of the atoll-sprinkled Indian Ocean as you come in to land. Sit either side Venice (VCE) From the air, Venice looks like a fish, swimming towards the mainland with its tail flapping against the Adriatic Sea. You don\u2019t see that from the ground, but you do as you come in to land at Marco Polo airport, due north of the city center on the mainland. Sit on the right of the plane and you\u2019ll see the city unspool beneath you, from the MOSE flood barriers and Lido island to the terracotta roofs, stocky belltowers and even flashes of the Grand Canal. In the last few seconds of the flight you\u2019ll see Burano and Torcello islands, before landing amid the salt marshes of the north lagoon. Sit on the right Cape Town (CPT) Swaddled by two oceans \u2013 the Indian and Atlantic \u2013 and with Table Mountain looming up behind, Cape Town is up there with Rio de Janeiro for a spectacular natural setting. Sit on the right hand side and, if you\u2019re on a northwestern approach, you should fly past Table Mountain, poking out above the clouds. You might also glimpse Simon\u2019s Town on the Cape peninsula, or fly straight out over the ocean and back at the city \u2013 in which case, you\u2019ll have water views on either side. Sit on the right San Francisco (SFO) With its mixture of coastline and hills, San Francisco is up there with Cape Town and Rio for knockout natural beauty, and you\u2019ll get views aplenty landing at SFO. It\u2019s best at take off, when the left side can often net you views of the city and Golden Gate Bridge before you bank east. On landing, either side should give you water views \u2013 with glimpses of the ocean to the left and the Bay Area to the right. Sit on the left Genoa (GOA) There are few better ways to make an entry onto the Med than with a landing at Genoa\u2019s airport, whose runway is a peninsula of reclaimed land dandling on the Ligurian Sea, just outside the city center. Which side to plump for depends whether you\u2019re a fan of sea or city views: to see the brightly colored houses of Genoa city center spooling down the cliffside, with mountains rearing up behind them, sit on the right; if you prefer the glistening Med, and the feeling of landing on water, pick the left \u2013 you\u2019ll see the tarmac just before you hit it. Sit on the right for the city, the left for water views London Heathrow (LHR) Heathrow airport may be a way outside London\u2019s city center, but if you\u2019re flying in on the often used eastern approach, you\u2019ll get a bird\u2019s eye view of the UK capital on the right hand side as you swoop over its landmarks on final approach. You\u2019ll follow the Thames through central London, past Greenwich and Canary Wharf, over London Bridge and St Paul\u2019s, and finally past Buckingham Palace and the royal parks which surround it. You\u2019ll glimpse Wembley Stadium right before touchdown. Another, less used approach goes over Windsor \u2013 although the best views for that are from the left. Sit on the right Kigali (KGL) Rwanda is beautiful from the air, and the descent into capital Kigali shows off the country at its best. Crossing over from the Democratic Republic of Congo into Rwanda, you\u2019ll descend over lush green hills, speckled with houses and red streaks of the local earth roads \u2013 all backed up by mountains in the distance for added drama. On the right side, you should glimpse Lake Kivu, which acts as the border between Rwanda and the DCR, before descending over the hills. Sit on the right Nice (NCE) Like Genoa along the coast, and Santos Dumont in Rio, Nice\u2019s airport is built on water, with the runway on reclaimed land. From the left hand side, you\u2019ll likely glide past the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur coastline as you come in, while on the right you\u2019ll see the glittering sea. Sitting on the left for take-off should net you views of Monaco, too. Sit on the left S\u00e3o Paulo (GRU) The world\u2019s largest Portuguese-speaking city, with a whopping population of 12.3 million, S\u00e3o Paulo can feel intimidatingly huge on the ground, but flying in is a different thing entirely. Take an evening flight to see the ultimate urban landscape rolling out below you \u2013 a galaxy of lights beaming so strong that even in cloud cover, those same clouds gleam as if they\u2019re alive. Wherever you sit (as long as it\u2019s not over the wing) you\u2019ll have a sparkling view. Sit either side Innsbruck (INN) Nervous fliers might want a drink before they commence their descent into Innsbruck. The main airport in Austria\u2019s Tyrol region, it\u2019s cocooned by mountains on all sides \u2013 mountains the planes must clear on final descent before making it into the valley to land. Having said that, it\u2019s a spectacular entrance \u2013 particularly in winter, when those same mountains are dusted in snow. Either side\u2019s spectacular, though down in the valley, the mountains on the left, dotted with villages,are arguably more interesting to look at. Sit on the left Queenstown (ZQN) The weather is the main issue flying into the main airport on New Zealand\u2019s South Island \u2013 and means you may barely get a view at all. But if the clouds are playing ball, landing here means spectacular views of the Southern Alps. The left side should give you the best views of the mountains and the South Island\u2019s coast unfolding ahead of you. Sit on the left Hong Kong (HKG) Hong Kong International Airport (also known as Chep Lak Kok) is built on reclaimed land in the South China Sea, so you already know it\u2019s going to be another great landing. Visibility tends to be not great, but you\u2019ll still have superb views of the South China Sea and its islands as you get below cloud level. You\u2019ll swoop over container ships, fishing boats and junks, before descending close to Lantau island (usually on the right) and onto the tarmac. Sit on the right Santiago de Chile (SCL) If snowcapped mountains are your thing, this is the destination for you. You\u2019ll have ravishing views of the Andes as you come in towards Santiago, giving way to arid hills and then the plains, those mountains rearing up in the distance, as you come into the basin to land. Stay on the left side to keep the Andes in sight all the way down. Sit on the left Las Vegas (LAS) Sit on the right of the plane and look north as you come into land at Sin City for spectacular views of the famous Strip. Make it an evening flight to see the neon lights at their finest, or fly in during the day for views of the never-ending Mojave desert surrounding it. You\u2019ll usually approach over Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam, while take-offs whisk you over the sandstone \u2018hills\u2019 of Red Rock Canyon.

{"id": "2024_05_16_uk_queen-camilla-royal-warrants-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Queen Camilla\u00a0has granted her first royal warrants to seven companies, including Shane Connolly, the designer behind\u00a0the floral arrangements at\u00a0last year\u2019s Coronation\u00a0and the King and Queen\u2019s 2005 wedding, as well as the upmarket central London department store Fortnum & Mason. The seven companies chosen by Camilla are among 145 previously selected by King Charles III when he was Prince of Wales, which have now had their warrants renewed following his ascent to the throne. Royal warrants act as a stamp of approval to indicate the preferred goods and services used by the royal household and senior members of the royal family. So, if you want to know where Charles and Camilla go hat shopping or buy their wine or organic meat from, it\u2019s worth checking out which companies made the cut. The use of royal warrants can be traced back to medieval times when Henry II first granted a Royal Charter to the Weavers\u2019 Company, according to the Royal Warrants Holders Association. In the 15th century, the first official royal warrants were granted, including to the King\u2019s printer, William Caxton. Selected companies are given permission to use the royal coat of arms on their packaging, vehicles and advertising for five years. Today, the act of officially endorsing particular brands remains one of the last remaining powers of the British monarchy not influenced by Parliament. Brand finance expert David Haigh says that customers are willing to pay between 12% and 24% extra for brands that have a royal warrant, according to research carried out by his consultancy last year. \u201cThere is no doubt that once you get a royal warrant, it does make a difference, day-to-day on the street when people are buying your products and when it comes to the sale of a company,\u201d he told CNN. They can also benefit British companies on the international stage, Haigh added. \u201cThere are plenty of situations where British brands are forging ahead in places like America, the Middle East, China, and having a royal warrant definitely helps.\u201d Royal warrants are given to a wide range of individuals and companies in various sectors, from agriculture and conservation to office supplies and clothing. Other companies on the King and Queen\u2019s latest list include Wartski, a London-based jewelry business, Corgi Hosiery Ltd, a Welsh independent sock manufacturer, and Camel Valley, a vineyard in Cornwall trusted to make sparkling wines for the royals. \u201cHer Majesty has taken a keen interest in the development of English wines,\u201d said Bob Lindo, managing director of Camel Valley, adding that she has been \u201ca terrific source of encouragement and enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cTo now have been appointed as one of her first warrant holders is very special,\u201d he said. Getting the royal seal of approval takes several years and involves a tough application process. \u201cIf you have been offering your goods to one of the royal palaces that grant these things for more than five years continuously, you are eligible to apply,\u201d Haigh says. This year there was a \u201crigorous focus on acting for a sustainable future,\u201d according to Tom Athron, CEO of Fortnum & Mason, the luxury London-based food and drinks store which was granted one of Camilla\u2019s first royal warrants. Haigh has also noticed this shift towards good environmental practice. \u201cIt seems quite clear that if there are any [Environmental, Social and Governance] problems with the company, they will not get a royal warrant,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that actually creates a bit of a double whammy of benefit to those companies. If someone in the royal family uses your product, they like it and they think it\u2019s good, that\u2019s one thing. If on the other hand they are endorsing the fact that you have high standards of ESG, in the current world, that is worth its weight in gold.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/uk/queen-camilla-royal-warrants-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_asia_south-korea-space-out-competition-intl-hnk", "text": "More than 100 people gathered silently on yoga mats over the weekend to do absolutely nothing, in a Seoul event that is part physical challenge, part art piece, and part respite from South Korea\u2019s hyper-competitive society. The annual Space-out competition, held on Sunday, finds who\u2019s best at zoning out for 90 minutes without falling asleep, checking their phone or talking. Participants\u2019 heart rates are monitored, while onlookers vote for their 10 favorite contestants. Whoever has the most stable heart rate among the 10 takes home the trophy. Among those taking part was speed skater Kwak Yoon-gy, a double Olympic silver medalist. \u201cI tried out for the Olympics five times and have never taken a proper rest while training for 30 years,\u201d said the 34-year-old short-track specialist, who took third place. \u201cI heard this place is where I can clear my mind and rest at least during this time, so I came here thinking, \u2018Wow, this is what I needed so much.\u2019\u201d More than 4,000 people applied to participate in the competition, hosted by the city government. The 117 contestants selected ranged from a child in second grade to people in their 60s. For many participants, it was a way to recover from burnout and stress, often from their work, in a country with high academic stress and extreme pressure to succeed. \u201cI usually had a lot of worries and stress, so I applied [to participate] because I thought it would be nice to blow away such stress and worries by spacing out in the competition,\u201d said 26-year-old YouTuber Kim Seok-hwan. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Space-out competition, founded by a visual artist, who goes by the pseudonym Woopsyang, after she suffered severe burnout.  \u201cI wondered why I was so anxious about doing nothing,\u201d she recalled, adding that that\u2019s when she realized her anxiety came from comparing herself to other people leading busy lives. \u201cIn fact, those people could also be wanting to space out and do nothing like me,\u201d Woopsyang said. \u201cSo, I created a competition thinking that it would be nice to pause all together at the same place at the same time.\u201d Competitive idling \u201coverturns the social convention that spacing out is a waste of time in today\u2019s busy society and turns it into a valuable activity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis contest tells you that spacing out is no longer a waste of time but a time that you really need.\u201d The competition is also performance art, she said. \u201cAlthough the contestants are staying still inside the competition venue, the audience is constantly moving around,\u201d Woopsyang said, adding her goal was to \u201ccreate a visual contrast between a group that does nothing and a group that is busy.\u201d Since the first Space-out competition was held in Seoul in 2014, it has expanded internationally, with contests taking place in various cities such as Beijing, Rotterdam, Taipei, Hong Kong and Tokyo. This year\u2019s competition in Seoul was won by freelance announcer Kwon So-a, who works multiple jobs, and took home a trophy shaped like the Auguste Rodin sculpture \u201cThe Thinker.\u201d \u201cEspecially here in Korea, it\u2019s such a competitive country, where people think that if they do nothing that they are a little behind,\u201d Kwon, 35, said. \u201cI think everyone has to have their own pace and sometimes just slow down.\u201d Doing nothing is \u201cgood for your mental health as well as your physical health because your body has to relax, but your body can only relax when your brain relaxes,\u201d she added. \u201cFor both of these reasons, people should space out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/asia/south-korea-space-out-competition-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system", "text": "A pair of recent ransomware attacks crippled computer systems at two major American health care firms, disrupting patient care and exposing fundamental weaknesses in the US health care system\u2019s defenses against hackers. In both cases, federal officials and private cyber experts scrambled to try to limit the damage and get computers back online. But the cascading effects from the hacks, with ambulances diverted from hospitals and pharmacies unable to process insurance, has underscored for some US lawmakers, senior Biden administration officials and policy experts that the health care system is ill-prepared for the ripple effects of a cyberattack and needs new security regulations. Health care lags other industries such as big financial institutions and energy providers when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, told CNN that \u201cevery new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the health care sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine.\u201d Without action, the senator said, \u201cpatients\u2019 access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.\u201d In 2023, 46 hospital systems in the US, comprising 141 hospitals, were impacted by ransomware,\u00a0according\u00a0to a tally from cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.\u00a0That\u2019s up from 25 hospital systems hit by ransomware in 2022, according to the firm. The two ransomware attacks hit different nerves of the health care system. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue, snarled service at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0may have compromised\u00a0the personal data of a third of Americans. In early May, cybercriminals used a different type of ransomware in an attack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals and 40 senior living facilities in 19 states. The hack\u00a0forced\u00a0the health network to divert ambulances from some hospitals. The Biden administration is preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals, senior White House cyber official Anne Neuberger confirmed this month. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would effectively re-victimize victims of cyberattacks by imposing penalties after they are hacked. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services previously said\u00a0they are willing to use a number of measures,\u00a0including\u00a0imposing\u00a0monetary fines, to both force and encourage health care organizations to better secure their systems. Momentum is also growing on Capitol Hill to force health care organizations to meet basic cybersecurity standards. A bill\u00a0introduced\u00a0in March by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, would allow \u201cadvanced and accelerated\u201d Medicare payments to be sent to hacked health care providers as long as those providers and their contractors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. An unhealthy situation The ransomware attacks on Change Healthcare and Ascension have spotlighted the health sector\u2019s cybersecurity weakness like no other events before it, experts told CNN. And even if there are new regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, the sector \u201cwill continue to struggle from such attacks if the business of providing\u00a0healthcare remains financially fraught [and forces] leaders to prioritize only revenue generating investments,\u201d Carter Groome, chief executive of cybersecurity firm First Health Advisory, told CNN. The Change Healthcare ransomware attack, in particular, has brought fresh attention from policymakers and experts on what many see as the over-consolidation of the US health care industry. If hackers can defeat security measures at one company, millions of patients who rely on that health network can be affected. \u201cUS healthcare is in a death spiral,\u201d said Corman, who co-founded I am the Cavalry, a volunteer group that focuses on cybersecurity for resource-poor organizations in the health sector, among others. \u201cDistressed hospitals get acquired into too-big-to-fail conglomerates. Ransoms cause distress for the little ones, and multi-week, multi-state outages for the ones \u2018saved\u2019 by the big ones.\u201d Any new cybersecurity regulations should be strong enough to force meaningful improvements in the sector\u2019s cybersecurity, Corman argued. \u2018Yes. cybersecurity is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we can clearly see\u2026 neglect is more costly.\u201d Change Healthcare\u2019s parent firm, UnitedHealth Group, owns a significant portion of the US health care market. The company, which reported $371 billion in revenue last year, handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. \u201cYour revenues are bigger than some countries\u2019 GDP,\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican,\u00a0told\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty in a Senate hearing this month.\u00a0\u201cAnd how in heaven\u2019s name did you not have the necessary redundancies so that you did not experience this attack and find yourself so vulnerable?\u201d The Justice Department has been pursuing an antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth Group, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in February. More broadly, the Justice Department last week\u00a0announced\u00a0a\u00a0task force to examine \u201chealth care monopolies and collusion\u201d that will guide the department\u2019s approach to \u201ccivil and criminal enforcement in health care markets,\u201d where warranted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_africa_prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex landed in Nigeria on Friday, launching a three-day private visit to the West African nation, where they will meet with wounded soldiers and visit local charities, officials said. The Sussexes are visiting the country as it\u2019s now a \u201cpart of the Invictus community,\u201d Air Vice-Marshal Abidemi Marquis, director of sports for the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, said during a media briefing Thursday. Their first engagement was an event hosted at a school in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, where Meghan told students: \u201cI see myself in all of you.\u201d Outside the Lightway Academy, students lined up patiently to welcome the royal couple, alongside a troupe of dancers. They were there to kick off a two-day mental health summit run by the GEANCO Foundation, which supports girls and young women across the country with menstrual health products and education. \u201cWe\u2019re so honored to be with you. We have got to acknowledge those amazing dance moves! My husband was excited to jump up!\u201d Meghan told cheering students in the school\u2019s hall. Harry then jumped into the conversation, asking the children about their knowledge of mental health and reminding them to look after themselves and each other. \u201cWill you promise to us that after today, no more being scared, no more being unsure of mental health. If you are unsure, then ask. Ask your teachers. Ask your friends. Be there for one another,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see your friend in your class not smiling, what are you gonna do? You gonna check in with them? Are you gonna ask him if they\u2019re okay? \u2018cause it\u2019s okay not to be okay.\u201d As they were leaving, the couple were given a traditional wooden mask and a set of books about Nigerian heritage. \u201cI need to read these now,\u201d the duchess added. Prince Harry and Meghan were invited to Nigeria by the chief of defense staff, Christopher Musa, the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official. He formally welcomed them to Nigeria at a meeting Friday lunchtime at the defense headquarters in the heart of Abuja. The duke expressed gratitude to their hosts, commending Nigeria for recognizing the power of sport in the rehabilitation process for the injured or wounded. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first country to notice that it not only transforms lives but saves lives. I\u2019m eternally grateful to you all of you for joining the Invictus movement for Nigeria and for every single soul who\u2019s been injured protecting the freedoms of Nigeria,\u201d he said. Marquis said the duchess was keen to accompany her husband on the visit \u201cas part of her lineage and heritage.\u201d Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. The trip to Nigeria sparked a wave of excitement among the public when it was announced two weeks ago. Oyeyemi Aderibigbe, 38, a Lagos-based lawyer, told CNN, \u201cI have watched Harry\u2019s evolution and quest for personal expression\u2026 and I love how bold he is about living authentically. Meghan was my favorite character in the \u2018Suits\u2019 series. I love how she has spent so much time using her voice for good, openly sharing her experiences.\u201d \u201cTogether, they are using their influence to democratize opportunity and push causes for the advantage of underrepresented groups. I would love to see them at an event with young people in politics in Nigeria,\u201d she added. Entrepreneur Ife Durosinmi-Etti spoke of her joy that Meghan was \u201ccoming to a place that she\u2019s absolutely loved and welcomed.\u201d \u201cIt got me all giddy when I found out about her Nigerian heritage because Nigerian women are smart, resilient, multitalented, they go after what they want and that\u2019s exactly how I see her, so when I heard; I was like, \u2018Yup, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s the Nigerian Spirit in her,\u2019\u201d the 35-year-old said. A packed itinerary This is the Sussexes\u2019 first trip as a couple to Nigeria, where they will be heavily promoting Invictus as well as the themes of mental health and female empowerment.  Harry flew to Abuja after a quick visit to London, where he attended events marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games, a Paralympics-style event for wounded, injured and sick military personnel and veterans. Meghan flew in from Los Angeles, and together, they are following a busy schedule, which includes visiting a military rehabilitation center and local organizations dedicated to supporting veterans\u2019 welfare. On Saturday, the duke is also scheduled to join wounded veterans during a sitting volleyball game and later, his wife is expected to co-host a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the World Trade Organization. As it has been described as a private visit, the royal couple will not be meeting with Nigeria\u2019s president, Bola Tinubu. However, they will meet with the governors of Lagos and Kaduna State. The UK\u2019s high commissioner to Nigeria, Richard Montgomery, told local media that there wouldn\u2019t be a meeting with the Nigerian leader because \u201cthey are visiting in a private capacity, not an official one.\u201d Profound challenges Nigeria\u2019s military personnel face profound challenges, particularly as the country has been combating the Boko Haram insurgency since 2009. On Friday, Musa told the couple more about some of the issues \u2013 like terrorism and criminality \u2013 that the armed forces contend with, adding that IEDs present \u201cthe greatest challenge\u201d for them. In response, the duke shared that he was looking forward to visiting a hospital supporting military personnel in Kaduna, a city in the north of the country. The couple\u2019s hosts, the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, are eager to be involved further in the Invictus Games and to be part of the wider Invictus community. Recalling how the most recent games, which were held in Germany last year, saw Nigeria become the first African country to participate, Harry reminisced: \u201cThe team that turned up in D\u00fcsseldorf was small but mighty. They danced their way into the stage. They won medals and danced off the stage. They were the life and soul of those games. Our goal now is to help you grow that team and provide as much opportunity and resource here in Nigeria and for the games that are coming at the beginning of next year.\u201d Marquis said taking part in the Invictus Games recovery program has boosted the morale of Nigerian soldiers and Nigeria has expressed interest in hosting the games, which take place every two years. He added: \u201cEighty percent of our soldiers involved in these recovery programs have a better outlook in life and say it has given them the opportunity to improve their self-esteem and mental health.\u201d Cpl.

The announcement of Sutskever\u2019s departure comes one day after OpenAI unveiled its latest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4o, in a presentation that impressed onlookers with its capabilities. Sutskever\u2019s role at OpenAI will be filled by Jakub Pachocki, previously the company\u2019s director of research, according to the company. Sutskever made headlines nearly six months ago when he voted to remove Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board. CNN contributor Kara Swisher previously reported that the decision to fire Altman was driven by Sutskever\u2019s concerns that Altman had pushed AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d Days after Altman\u2019s ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return. Altman did not stay on the outs for too long. Five days after his firing, Altman returned to the company as CEO, and Sutskever issued a public apology for his role in the corporate drama. \u201cI deeply regret my participation in the board\u2019s actions,\u201d Sutskever wrote on X in November. \u201cI never intended to harm OpenAI.

{"id": "2024_05_15_tech_tiktok-frank-mccourt-bid-creator-lawsuit", "text": "Another wealthy investor says he\u2019s organizing a bid to purchase TikTok, after President Joe Biden signed a law last month forcing TikTok to find a new owner or be banned in the United States. Frank McCourt, a real estate billionaire and the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, said Wednesday he is laying the groundwork to acquire TikTok as part of a broad initiative to make a healthier internet. McCourt, who has spent years accusing technology giants of exploiting their users and undermining the internet\u2019s original open vision, did not disclose how much he aims to spend on TikTok or how much he believes the platform is worth. Nor did he address how he plans to deal with the Chinese government\u2019s expected opposition to a forced sale, which would likely trigger export controls China has imposed on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0secretive recommendation algorithm. Still, McCourt said, the potential opportunity to acquire TikTok is a chance to rewire how social media works. Under McCourt\u2019s proposal, TikTok would operate on an open-source, decentralized protocol where users control their own data no matter what social media app they use. \u201cWe can, and must, do more to safeguard the health and well-being of our children, families, democracy and society,\u201d McCourt said in a statement. \u201cWe believe we can preserve \u2014 and enhance \u2014 the TikTok experience by giving individuals and creators on the platform the value and control they deserve regarding who has access to their data and how it is used.\u201d McCourt said he is working with the investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis to help assemble the bid, adding that the push is backed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. McCourt joins a host of other would-be suitors angling to pick up a platform used by 170 million Americans. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced in March he\u2019s assembling a bid, as well as Kevin O\u2019Leary, the Canadian chairman of the private venture capital firm O\u2019Leary Ventures. TikTok, meanwhile, has indicated that it\u2019s not for sale and the company has instead begun to mount a fight against the new law. The company sued to block the law earlier this month, saying that spinning off from its Chinese parent company is not feasible and that the legislation would lead to a ban of the app in the United States starting in January of next year. TikTok\u2019s lawsuit claims\u00a0the US government \u201chas taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning\u201d the short-form video app in an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power that would affect both the platform and its American users. A group of eight TikTok creators on Tuesday also filed a separate lawsuit challenging the potential ban. Their suit calls the law an \u201cextraordinary restraint on speech that violates the First Amendment\u201d and alleged that the law \u201cpromises to shutter a discrete medium of communication that has become part of American life.\u201d The group includes a college football coach; a rancher and former US marine; and a small business owner who runs a line of skincare products, among others, who collectively claim approximately 14 million followers on TikTok. Several of the creators claim they could lose money earned through TikTok\u2019s Creator Fund or by promoting their small businesses if the app were banned, and that their attempts to use other platforms have proven less fruitful. \u201cAs Americans, we should be able to pick whatever apps we use and the government shouldn\u2019t have the power to take that freedom away from us haphazardly,\u201d one of the creators involved in the suit, Topher Townsend, said in a statement. \u201cTikTok contributes significantly to my income and allowed the opportunity to be a full-time creator for almost four years now \u2026 This (new law) is being driven by larger politics, but the end result is going to harm a lot of people, including me.\u201d TikTok declined to comment on the creator lawsuit.

{"id": "2024_05_15_world_first-warm-blooded-dinosaurs-scn", "text": "Were dinosaurs warm-blooded like birds and mammals or cold-blooded like reptiles? It\u2019s one of paleontology\u2019s oldest questions, and gleaning the answer matters because it illuminates how the prehistoric creatures may have lived and behaved. Challenging the prevailing idea that they were all slow, lumbering lizards that basked in the sun to regulate their body temperature, research over the past three decades has revealed that some dinosaurs were likely birdlike, with feathers and perhaps the ability to generate their own body heat. However, it\u2019s hard to find evidence that unquestionably shows what dinosaur metabolisms were like. Clues from dinosaur eggshells and bones have suggested that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and others were not. A new study published in the journal Current Biology on Wednesday suggested that three main dinosaur groups adapted differently to changes in temperature, with the ability to regulate body temperature evolving in the early Jurassic Period about 180 million years ago. Based on fossils from 1,000 dinosaur species and paleoclimate information, the new study looked at the spread of dinosaurs across different environments on Earth throughout the dinosaur era, which started some 235 million years ago\u00a0and ended 66 million years ago when an asteroid slammed into Earth. Two of the three main groups \u2014 meat-eating therapod dinosaurs, which included T. rex, and plant-eating ornithischians, whose notable members included Triceratops and Stegosaurus \u2014 spread to live in colder climates during the early Jurassic Period, the research suggested. These dinosaurs may have evolved endothermy, or the ability to internally generate body heat, according to the study. Two adaptable dinosaur groups Therapods and ornithischians lived in a broad range of thermal landscapes in their respective evolutionary histories and were \u201cremarkably adaptable,\u201d the researchers wrote. Recent fossil discoveries have shown that different species of dinosaurs even thrived in the Arctic, giving birth and living there year-round. \u201cWarm-blooded animals are generally more active, for example, cold-blooded animals usually don\u2019t build nests,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, Royal Society Newton International Fellow at University College London\u2019s department of Earth sciences. By contrast, the towering, plant-eating sauropods kept to warmer, lower-latitude regions of the planet, and the availability of richer foliage in certain habitats wasn\u2019t the only factor why, the study found. Sauropods, which included Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, also appeared to thrive in arid, savannahlike environments and practiced \u201cprolonged climatic conservatism,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIt reconciles well with what we imagine about their ecology,\u201d Chiarenza said. \u201cThey were the biggest terrestrial animals that ever lived. They probably would have overheated if they were hot-blooded.\u201d What\u2019s more, he added, the amount of plant matter they would have needed to consume if they were warm-blooded would have been unsustainable. \u201c(These animals) were living in herds and we know that each one of them was the equivalent of 10 African elephants. (If they were warm-blooded) they would just destroy plant life. It makes more sense, as living animals, for them to be more cold-blooded.\u201d However, Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral research scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said that the findings from this study contrasted with her own research, which looked at molecular traces of oxygen intake found in dinosaur fossils. Her 2022 study suggested that ornithischians were more likely cold-blooded and sauropods were warm-blooded. She questioned to what extent the biogeographic range of a dinosaur was determined by its metabolic capacity as opposed to other factors such as behavior, growth strategy, dietary preferences and other ecological interactions. \u201cSome animals with incredibly fast growth rates (i.e., sauropods), and by requirement, fast metabolisms, are here found to be cold-blooded, while other animals with very slow growth rates (i.e., ceratopsians) are recovered as endotherms,\u201d Wiemann said. \u201cThese discrepancies will need to be addressed.\u201d Evolutionary trigger Chiarenza said that the model, developed by researchers at UCL and Universidade de Vigo in Spain, suggested that the earliest dinosaurs were more reptilian and cold-blooded. But a period of global warming resulting from volcanic activity 180 million years ago, known as the Jenkyns Event, may have been a trigger for the evolution of the ability to generate body heat internally. \u201cAt this time, many new dinosaur groups emerged. The adoption of endothermy, perhaps a result of this environmental crisis, may have enabled theropods and ornithischians to thrive in colder environments, allowing them to be highly active and sustain activity over longer periods, to develop and grow faster and produce more offspring,\u201d he said in a news release. As with all research based on models, the study made predictions grounded in existing information. New fossils or climatic information might alter that picture. \u201cOf course, if a sauropod turned up in the Arctic that would change things,\u201d Chiarenza said. Paleontologist Anthony Fiorillo, executive director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science, said the study was \u201cintriguing\u201d and the \u201cfirst real attempt to quantify broad patterns that some of us had thought about previously.\u201d Fiorillo, who is also a senior fellow at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, wasn\u2019t involved with the research. \u201cTheir modeling helps create a robustness to our biogeographical understanding of dinosaurs, and their related physiology,\u201d he said. \u201cThis study provides a platform for us to further test what we think we might know.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/world/first-warm-blooded-dinosaurs-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gallant\u2019s remarks come as serious questions about Israel\u2019s long-term strategy in Gaza are being raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza it had withdrawn from months ago to battle Hamas militants who had returned amid a power vacuum. Israeli military officials have quietly warned that the lack of a long-term strategy for post-war governance will result in this pattern repeating throughout Gaza. And top US officials are doing so publicly, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning Wednesday that Israel must \u201cfocus on what the future can and must be\u201d to avoid \u201canarchy and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos.\u201d Gallant has previously said he opposes Israeli control over post-war Gaza, but his remarks Wednesday were his most direct on the topic as he warned of the consequences of a long-term Israeli military presence in Gaza and called out Netanyahu directly. \u201cI will not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza. Israel must not establish civilian rule in Gaza,\u201d he said, warning that a military occupation of the Palestinian territory would take a heavy toll in \u201cbloodshed and victims, as well as a heavy economic price,\u201d he warned. Netanyahu appeared to respond to Gallant\u2019s remarks later on Wednesday, saying in a video statement posted to social media that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority would be acceptable entities to govern Gaza. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to replace Hamastan with Fatahstan,\u201d he said, referring to Fatah, the Palestinian political party that dominates the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu also said that a complete routing of Hamas would be his prerequisite for a new civilian government in Gaza.\u00a0\u201cAs long as Hamas remains in place, no other entity would enter Gaza to administer the civilian aspects, especially not the Palestinian Authority,\u201d he said. Gallant\u2019s remarks set off a political firestorm in Israel, with a number of right-wing lawmakers condemning\u00a0Gallant\u2019s statement and some even urging Netanyahu to remove him from his position. War cabinet member Minister Benny Gantz meanwhile has endorsed Gallant\u2019s stance, saying he was \u201cspeaking the truth\u201d. The public clash between Gallant and Netanyahu follows repeated calls by the US for Israel to produce a clear plan for post-war Gaza. \u201cWe do not support and will not support an Israeli occupation.

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The vandalism took place last week at the Golden Dragon Museum in Bendigo, about 100 miles northwest of Melbourne, according to the police and head of the museum. Victoria Police said a man and a woman are suspected of damaging AUD$100,000 ($66,900) worth of art and historical items, before making off in a silver Toyota Prado on May 5. \u201cInvestigators believe the duo used a liquid to cause damage to multiple statues and paintings,\u201d police said, adding that the suspects were with two children at the time. Among the artefacts attacked was Loong \u2013 described by the museum as the \u201coldest complete imperial processional dragon in the world.\u201d \u201cLoong\u201d is a sacred mythical creature in Chinese culture \u2013 usually translated as dragon in English \u2013 and is often the protagonist in festivities and rituals. Dragon dances have been documented at ceremonial events since the Han Dynasty (202 BCE to 220 CE) and often involve teams of dancers manipulating a giant dragon puppet through the streets. Bendigo, currently a city of some 100,000 people, has had Chinese residents for more than a century. Chinese immigrants first arrived mostly from southern China in the mid-1800s during the Victorian goldrush and at one point made up 20 percent of the town\u2019s residents. Miners and merchants brought their customs and culture with them to a place they once called \u201cDai Gum San\u201d - or \u201cBig Gold Mountain,\u201d according to Bendigo Tourism. To this day, a large dragon parade is held every Easter to raise money for a local hospital. The Golden Dragon Museum was opened in 1991 \u201cto document, interpret and preserve the Chinese heritage in Australia\u201d according to the museum\u2019s website. Loong, which dates back 1901, was routinely paraded through the streets of Victoria until the 1970s when it was retired. Hugo Leschen, Chief Executive Officer of the museum, told CNN that they found oily liquid running down Loong\u2019s nose. Its successor Sun Loong, which took over to parade around the Bendigo until it was also retired in 2019, was also damaged, Leschen said, citing stains on the second dragon\u2019s tongue. Other parts of the museum were also targeted. Security camera footage aired on CNN affiliate Nine News showed a woman clad in a white sweater and grey beanie splashing liquid at a Buddhist altar. A man stood next to her in the clip. Stains were also found on at least 35 paintings and several statues of Chinese deities in the temple as well as a garden next door managed by the museum, Leschen said. \u201cWith these further attacks it is now evident that this was no random act of mindless vandalism but rather a planned and sustained malicious attack across various heritage, cultural and religious sites for reasons unknown,\u201d he said. The Chinese Community Council of Australia condemned the vandalism in a statement. While police have yet to comment on the motivation, the group is concerned the act \u201cmay have been racially motivated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/vandals-target-oldest-chinese-dragon-in-australian-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_driverless-car-race-abu-dhabi-spc", "text": "Hype over autonomous vehicles has sometimes outpaced reality. For years, forecasters have predicted that driverless cars, which would allow the average commuter to snooze or watch Netflix on their way into the office, were just around the corner. Many experts have tempered their expectations. Widespread implementation of autonomous technology won\u2019t be realized within the next decade, according to an\u202fanalysis\u202freleased in late 2023 by S&P Global Mobility, which provides insights into the automotive industry. But Lakmal Seneviratne, the founding director of the Khalifa University Center for Autonomous Robotic Systems (KUCARS) in Abu Dhabi, believes that autonomous mobility still has a bright future. He\u2019s been working on robotics since the 1980s, and he\u2019s surprised by how quickly autonomous technology has advanced. He sees this in his day-to-day work at KUCARS, where researchers are working on everything from autonomous cars and drones to marine, agricultural, and manufacturing robotics. Last month, the point was driven home when Khalifa University participated in the inaugural Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League event, or the A2RL, which pitted technologists from across the world against each other in a series of challenges. There have been other autonomous car races before, but A2RL\u2019s was the first to include a race between four driverless cars, according to organizers. \u201cIf you asked me even 10 or 15 years ago if I would ever see an autonomous car race, I would have said: \u2018No, not in my lifetime\u2019,\u201d Seneviratne told CNN via video call after the event. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see how that technology has developed.\u201d \u2018Real world robotics is very, very hard\u2019 Khalifa University, which partnered with the Beijing\u202fInstitute of Technology to form team Fly Eagle, didn\u2019t end up racing in the final. Its car crashed a few days before the race, and they couldn\u2019t get things back on track. It wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing for the four teams that did compete on Abu Dhabi\u2019s Yas Marina Circuit, where in November Formula One\u2019s Max Verstappen ended a record-breaking season with an Abu Dhabi Grand Prix win. Technical University of Munich (TUM)\u2019s car stopped on the track, before restarting. Team Polimove\u2019s vehicle spun around after its tires locked up. Soon after, another car came to a halt \u2013 leaving just TUM moving. Then its car stopped too. Three cars were able to get going again, but towards the end of the race, the leader came to an abrupt halt, and TUM overtook it to cruise to victory. Seneviratne wasn\u2019t exactly surprised by the difficulties. He said that some of the challenges were beyond the scope of today\u2019s technology. \u201cReal world robotics is very, very hard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was good to push the community.\u201d Simon Hoffman, TUM\u2019s team principal, told CNN that past autonomous events\u00a0have only raced with two cars on the track at a time, and that any multiple-vehicle races have been on oval tracks. By contrast, Yas Marina Circuit has tight turns, chicanes and hairpins.\u00a0The track is a permanent fixture on Yas Island, but it has elements of a street circuit built in. \u201cI think it\u2019s more challenging to do it on road courses because you have sharper turns, need to brake into turns, you see higher delta speeds between cars, which makes it more difficult,\u201d Hoffman added. Pushing the technology to the edge Efforts to set driverless cars loose on public roads have faced setbacks, especially as the result of collisions with unforeseen obstacles. In 2018, for example, a self-driving Uber SUV killed a woman pushing her bicycle across a street, outside of a crosswalk, because it didn\u2019t recognize a jaywalking pedestrian. The\u202fability to master so-called \u201cedge cases\u201d \u2013 situations which push technology to the limits of its ability, perhaps as the result of unexpected and improbable events \u2013 will be crucial before driverless vehicles can be widely adopted. Some observers, organizers and participants say that endeavors like AR2L \u2013 where the technology can be tested at its limits \u2013 may provide a productive training ground for driverless cars. \u201cIf you have other cars, how do you react with them? How do you overtake them at speed, in edge conditions?\u201d says Seneviratne. Hoffman agrees. \u201cIf we can develop robust software that \u2026 works in these conditions here, with very high speeds with other cars \u2026 we can make the software for autonomous driving more robust and more reliable, and in the end safer for everyone,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/driverless-car-race-abu-dhabi-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_india_india-election-mumbai-wealth-gap-issues-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "For millions of Indians, it\u2019s the city where dreams come true \u2013 just look around. From the gleaming home of Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, towering over \u201cBillionaires\u2019 Row,\u201d to the waterfront mansions of Bollywood stars, Mumbai is the place where ambitions are realized. But as India\u2019s financial capital prepares to vote in the country\u2019s massive general election, many residents say they want a fairer share of its wealth \u2013 with better education the key to opportunity. In the densely packed Dadar neighborhood, hustlers and dreamers alike spill out of train stations and shopping complexes, a whirl of humanity weaving through congested streets where market traders tout for business. Next to piles of potatoes and onions, 34-year-old grocer Sachin Chaudhary cites rising prices and a tough job market as his biggest concerns ahead of the city\u2019s first voting phase later in May. \u201cThe change I want to see is, things should become less costly,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd children are getting good educations, so there should also be better opportunities in the employment sector.\u201d As India\u2019s wealthiest city, Mumbai is often likened to New York \u2013 a place of opportunity where everyone is from somewhere else, hoping to make it big and support their families, often in poorer rural hometowns. But amid the glitz and glam, India\u2019s other half is just as evident. Near tourist hotspots like the iconic Gateway of India, day laborers toil in the stifling heat, carrying heavy loads on their shoulders or selling knickknacks on the side of dusty roads. The disparity concerns Rajani Bhat, a 42-year-old Mumbai resident with short, spiky hair and an assertive voice. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the protection of women, especially small girls,\u201d she says from a street dotted with jewelry and clothes stores. \u201cThey are selling dustbin bags, they are doing multiple (jobs), but what about their education? They have parents, but the thing is they (don\u2019t have the right) financial conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody should do something for them.\u201d Many poor children in the city are not even 10 years old when they start helping their parents to earn a living. It\u2019s especially common in Mumbai\u2019s infamous slums, which were depicted in the 2008 Oscar-winning film \u201cSlumdog Millionaire.\u201d Kalpita Shinde, a 43-year-old government worker, also highlights the need for India\u2019s next government to provide its people with greater upward mobility. \u201cAll should have employment, and the jobs should be on par with the better education opportunities we have,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people have good jobs, then it\u2019s not just the individual who grows. The whole family also grows and leads a better life.\u201d Banker Helen D\u2019Souza, 60, agreed with that sentiment. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to be done in this country, as regards (to) the middle class,\u201d she said over the thrum of Dadar\u2019s traffic. \u201cA lot of people are unhappy \u2026 When you don\u2019t get something, you lose trust.\u201d \u2018I want Narendra Modi\u2019 Every Mumbaikar who spoke to CNN emphasized the importance of voting as a civic duty, but only supporters of one party openly expressed their voting intentions. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are widely expected to win a third straight five-year term this election, extending his popular but controversial rule into a second decade. That dominance is reflected in the sheer amount of BJP campaign material displayed across the city, with scant signs of India\u2019s opposition. Modi\u2019s face beams from billboards and hangs off bridges, posters listing his achievements and election promises. For Bhat, the answer to India\u2019s poverty-stricken girls and women lies in Modi, who has been credited with boosting the country\u2019s economy, infrastructure and global standing. \u201cI want Narendra Modi \u2013 that\u2019s it. He\u2019s a true leader,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore Narendra Modi, nobody was aware about who\u2019s the president, who\u2019s the prime minister. \u201cBut now everybody\u2019s aware of that because he\u2019s going out, keeping relationships (with other countries), so that our country can cope with upcoming problems.\u201d Chatting to CNN between sips from a paper cup of chai, salesperson Parag Sawla, 42, echoes that sentiment. \u201cI will vote for the BJP as they are the perfect party,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me in this election, we need a party that focuses not only on global issues but on issues that matter to individuals in the country.\u201d But not every BJP voter is so enthusiastic. \u201cThere is no strong opposition, so I will vote for the BJP, as there are no other (significant) political parties. The BJP is ruling everywhere,\u201d says Chaudhary, the vegetable seller. \u201cIf there was a strong opposition, I would have more choice \u2013 but sadly, we don\u2019t.\u201d Religious tensions Education and employment aside, several other issues loom in the minds of Mumbai\u2019s voters \u2013 especially longstanding religious tensions that have spiraled under Modi\u2019s tenure. Modi and his BJP have been accused of driving religious polarization with Hindu-nationalist policies, giving rise to a wave of Islamophobia and deadly communal clashes. Many of the country\u2019s 230 million Muslims say they are being sidelined and marginalized in the world\u2019s largest democracy. One major point of contention is the BJP\u2019s attempt to pass a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a set of common laws for personal matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance \u2013 replacing religious laws followed by different groups. Some critics fear the government\u2019s Hindu-nationalist policies could unduly influence the legislation, further threatening the rights and freedoms of minorities. Others, however, say the reform of religious laws represents progress. Sanjay Sardesai, a 60-year-old retired airline worker, wouldn\u2019t indicate who he\u2019s voting for but says the civil code is the most important election issue. \u201cIt means that all sections of society, irrespective of their religion, shall be treated equally,\u201d he tells CNN while resting on his motorbike in Dadar. \u201cThat should be implemented so we are given the same rights all across India.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/india/india-election-mumbai-wealth-gap-issues-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_europe_ukraine-kharkiv-russia-attack-intl", "text": "For Ukraine,\u00a0May is turning out to be the cruellest month. The town of Vovchansk in\u00a0the northern\u00a0Kharkiv region, liberated from Russian occupation more than 18 months ago, awoke Friday to intense shelling and aerial bombardment. Russia\u00a0has found another way of stretching Ukraine\u2019s already thin blue line. President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials said that Russian efforts to advance towards the town had been thwarted, but the Russians have since tried to cut road links with\u00a0Vovchansk. The Russians launched battalion-strength attacks along a 60-kilometer stretch of the border\u00a0on Friday, claiming to occupy several villages in what is known as the \u2018gray zone\u2019 along the frontier,\u00a0after focusing much of their offensive capabilities this year on a grinding advance in Donetsk in the east that has seen incremental but significant progress. As of Saturday, it appeared the Russians still held a handful of Ukrainian border villages, with intense aerial bombardment continuing in the Vovchansk area. The\u00a0cross-border attack is yet another example of what\u2019s going wrong for the Ukrainians this year. Their forces are thinly stretched, with much less artillery than the Russians, grossly inadequate air defenses and above all a lack of soldiers. Their plight has been worsened by dry weather, allowing Russian mechanized units to move more easily. The deputy head of Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, Major-General Vadym Skibitsky, told the Economist last week: \u201cOur problem is very simple: we have no weapons. They always knew April and May would be a difficult time for us.\u201d Ukrainian intelligence estimates that despite immense losses since the full-scale invasion began, Russia has more than half-a-million men now inside Ukraine or at its borders. It is also \u201cgenerating a division of reserves\u201d in central Russia, according to Skibitsky. The northern border assault follows the creation of a new Russian military grouping\u00a0called\u00a0Sever [North].\u00a0 George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington told CNN that Sever is an \u201coperationally significant group.\u201d \u201cRussia sought to generate 60,000-100,000 troops for its group to attack Kharkiv and we assess it\u2019s closer to 50,000,\u201d Barros says, but \u201cit still has a lot of combat power.\u201d It\u2019s from this new force that units of armored infantry tried to cross the border. The available evidence suggests they were expected and suffered significant losses. But if more elite units join (there are reports that elements from\u00a0other divisions\u00a0may do so) Russia\u2019s\u00a0ambitions could\u00a0grow. As a Ukrainian special forces unit told CNN this weekend, \u201cThis is only the beginning, the Russians have a bridgehead for further offensives.\u201d One former Ukrainian officer who writes about the conflict on the blog Frontelligence says that \u201cManpower shortages compel Ukraine to avoid deploying large units along the border continuously, with fully stocked and ready for immediate-use artillery.\u201d He expects the situation to evolve, \u201cwith Russian forces deploying more units to penetrate additional border areas or to reinforce initial successes.\u201d Several analysts expect the Russians to broaden the border attacks westwards to Sumy region, which has seen months of raids by Russian special forces. The Sever grouping could not attack and occupy a city the size of Kharkiv, but that\u2019s likely not the goal. Barros says that it is instead to compel Ukrainian forces to pivot from Donetsk to Kharkiv region. The Russians seek to \u201cthin Ukrainian forces out along the 600-mile frontline and create opportunities, specifically in Donetsk oblast, which is Russia\u2019s main operational objective for 2024,\u201d Barros says. The latest cross-border assaults may also divert Ukrainian units from the defense of Kupiansk, also in Kharkiv region, where a Russian assault has stalled for months, as well as create a buffer zone inside Ukraine that the Kremlin says it wants to reduce attacks on Russian cities like Belgorod. Upping the tempo What\u2019s happening in Kharkiv is not isolated. The Ukrainian military acknowledged this week a spike in combat engagements (more than 150 on Thursday alone), coming on top of a marked increase from March to April. In effect, the Russians have the manpower to stretch Ukrainian defenses through multiple points of attack hundreds of kilometers apart, forcing Kyiv to guess where\u00a0and when\u00a0an anticipated early-summer offensive will focus. The increased tempo of attacks exacerbates Ukraine\u2019s two critical vulnerabilities: insufficient manpower and sparse air defenses. Russia is exploiting both in a hurry, keen to establish facts on the ground before a new wave of Western aid can help.\u00a0That is at least weeks away in any meaningful amounts. \u201cManpower remains a core challenge, and Ukraine is working to restore its existing degraded brigades as well as from about 10 new maneuver brigades,\u201d Barros says. Only in the last month has a law been passed to expand mobilization, nearly two years after Russia mobilized some 300,000 additional troops.\u00a0The process was bogged down in the Ukrainian parliament for months, and President Zelensky was wary of both the cost and the political fallout of a more extensive mobilization.\u00a0The numerical inferiority has sharply worsened across the frontlines, providing Russian commanders with a growing number of opportunities to probe for weaknesses. Western analysts believe that in Chasiv Yar, Donetsk, for example, the Ukrainians may be outnumbered by 10:1, as well as suffering a chronic imbalance in shells and a complete lack of air cover. One Ukrainian military blogger this week estimated that elements of as many as 15 Russian motorized rifle brigades (each of which would have up to 1,000 men) were operating in the Chasiv Yar direction alone. Lose the high ground around Chasiv Yar and an important belt of industrial towns and cities: Slaviansk, Kramatorsk and Kostyantinyvka, becomes much more vulnerable. Skibitsky told the Economist that losing Chasiv Yar was a distinct possibility - \u201cnot today or tomorrow, of course, but all depending on our reserves and supplies.\u201d North-east of Chasiv Yar, a soldier called Stanislav told Ukrainian television this week that after a month of \u201cvery active hostilities\u201d the Russians \u201care advancing from the direction of Kreminna, where they are accumulating great reserves.\u201d \u201cHuge numbers of Russian infantry are attacking day and night, in large and small groups,\u201d the soldier said. Besides the shortage of trained soldiers, \u201cRussia is leveraging Russian airspace as a sanctuary to strike Kharkiv oblast, highlighting the urgent need for the US to provide more long-range air defense assets and to allow the Ukrainians to use them to intercept Russian aircraft in Russian airspace,\u201d says Barros. The United States announced Friday a $400 million package of air defense munitions and other weapons, but much more will be needed. Ukraine\u2019s losses are compounded by a lack of\u00a0prepared defensive positions behind the front lines. where\u00a0they could\u00a0fall back. In Krasnohorivka, for example, Ukrainian units were able for months to use apartment buildings and a brick factory as defensive positions. Slowly they have been obliterated \u2013 with one Russian military blogger claiming that artillery fire had buried them \u201cunder the rubble of their own shelters.\u201d President Zelensky and others have talked more about \u201cactive defense\u201d \u2013 having better defensive fortifications as a building block to turn the tide on Russian advances. Zelensky himself has toured such fortifications. But they are too few and too late in critical areas, especially in Donetsk. Zelensky asserted this week that \u201cwe will be able to stop the [Russians] in the east\u201d when the aid arrives. But he acknowledged that \u201cthe situation there is really difficult\u201d and contended that the aid that\u2019s arrived so far is \u201cnot the volumes that were voted for.\u201d \u201cWe need everything to come faster,\u201d he added. Every day that it doesn\u2019t, the Russians edge forward \u2013 and the Ukrainians lose soldiers they can\u2019t afford to lose. Barros says the Russians were prepared for the hiatus in military aid. \u201cThe recent Russian gains we see now are not merely opportunistic; the Russians prepared for it and are now exploiting it. Ukraine may need to make difficult decisions due to slowness of US action and the dilemma that is now causing.\u201d That may amount to trading territory for time. And ultimately accepting that much of the territory now lost may not be recovered.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-russia-attack-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

At least four people have died in the unrest, which is considered the worst since the 1980s. In the capital Noumea, authorities have imposed a curfew and closed the main airport \u2014 usually a busy tourist hub \u2014 to commercial traffic. They have also banned public gatherings, carrying weapons and selling alcohol. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2014 who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Protests began Monday involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote 10,000 miles (17,000 kilometers) away in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted\u00a0overwhelmingly\u00a0in favor of the change. \u201cThe last two days we\u2019ve seen violence of a scale we haven\u2019t seen for 30 years in New Caledonia,\u201d Denise Fisher, a former\u00a0Australian Consul-General in New Caledonia, told CNN. \u201cIt is kind of marking the end of 30 years of peace.\u201d \u201cThe Kanak people are objecting to [the vote in France] not just because it\u2019s been decided in Paris without them but also they feel that they want it to be part of a negotiation \u2026 which would include another self determination vote and a range of other things.\u201d The proposed changes to the constitution would add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. France\u2019s interior ministry told CNN that 1,800 police officers and gendarmes are already present in New Caledonia and 500 additional police will arrive in the coming hours. The state of emergency will allow authorities to impose restrictions on movement and carry out house arrests and searches. A spokesperson for the French government said the measures were needed to \u201cdeal with the serious breaches of public order which are occurring.\u201d Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm, issuing a letter Wednesday to New Caledonian political leaders urging them to \u201cunambiguously condemn all this violence\u201d and inviting both pro- and anti-independence leaders to meet him \u201cface to face\u201d in Paris. Macron\u2019s administration has pushed for a pivot to the Indo-Pacific, stressing that France is a Pacific power, as China and the United States beef up their presence amid a battle for influence in the strategically important region. New Caledonia is at the center of that plan. \u201cThe stakes are high for France,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cFrance has identified an entire Indo-Pacific vision for itself.\u201d \u201cThe legitimacy of France\u2019s participation this way, having an influence in this way, is in question when you have scenes like this.\u201d The violence Three people - two men and a woman, all indigenous Kanaks - have been shot dead in the violent protests and looting, according to Charles Wea, spokesperson for\u00a0Louis Mapou, President of the Government of New Caledonia. A French police officer who was injured by gunfire in the riots also died, French interior minister\u00a0G\u00e9rald Darmanin said. Demonstrators have also set fire to buildings and cars in Noumea, defying a curfew that has been extended to Thursday. Thick plumes of black smoke covered the capital on Wednesday morning, social media video showed. Images showed burned-out cars, fires in the street, and shops vandalized and looted. \u201cSome are equipped with hunting rifles with buckshot as ammunition. Others were equipped with larger rifles, firing bullets,\u201d the French High commissioner to New Caledonia Louis Le Franc said. More than 140 people have been arrested, while at least 60 security personnel have been injured in the clashes between local nationalist groups and the French authorities, according to Le Franc. One Noumea resident told CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand of panic buying reminiscent of Covid-19. \u201cA lot of fire, violence\u2026but it\u2019s better I stay safe at home. There are a lot of police and army. I want the government to put the action for the peace,\u201d the person told RNZ, asking to remain anonymous. The vote Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies. Many indigenous inhabitants continue to live with high rates of poverty and high unemployment to this day. Deadly violence exploded in the 1980s eventually paving the way towards the Noumea Accord in 1998, a promise by France to give greater political autonomy to the Kanak community. Multiple referendums were held in recent years - in 2018, 2020 and 2021 - as part of the agreement offering voters in New Caledonia the option to secede from France. Each referendum was voted down, but the process was marred by boycotts from pro-independence groups and by Covid-19. Voter roles have been frozen since the Noumea Accord, the issue that France\u2019s parliament was seeking to address in the vote that sparked this week\u2019s violence. French lawmakers in Paris voted 351 \u2013 153 in favor of changing the constitution to \u201cunfreeze\u201d the territory\u2019s electoral rolls, enfranchising French residents who have been in New Caledonia for 10 years. The lists were frozen by the French government to appease pro-independence Kanak nationalists who believe new arrivals to the former colony, including from France, dilute popular support for independence. Both houses of France\u2019s parliament need to approve the constitutional change passed by the National Assembly. On Tuesday, French Prime Minister Gabriel\u00a0Attal said the government would not call a meeting of the parliament to vote on the motion before talks with Kanak leaders, including major independence alliance the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS). \u201cI invite New Caledonia\u2019s political leaders to seize this opportunity and come to Paris for talks in the coming weeks. The important thing is conciliation. Dialogue is important. It is about finding a common, political and global solution,\u201d\u00a0Attal said on the floor of the National Assembly. FLNKS issued its own statement Wednesday both condemning the vote at the National Assembly and calling for an end to the violence. \u201cFLNKS appeals to the youth involved in these demonstrations for appeasement and to ensure the safety of the population and property,\u201d the statement read.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/asia/new-caledonia-violence-france-vote-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_weather_south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate", "text": "Strong storms lashed parts of Texas with destructive winds and potentially dangerous flooding as power outages left more than 1 million homes and businesses in the dark across the state on Thursday, with the torrential storms pounding an already-soaked South. A rare Level 4 of 4 high risk of excessive rainfall was issued for parts of eastern Texas and western Louisiana by the Weather Prediction Center Thursday. More than 600,\ufeff000 people live in the high-risk zone. High risk days only happen on 4% of days each year, but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the United States, according to the WPC. Just three other days have reached this concerning mark this year, including the most recent one nearly three weeks ago. It\u2019s a sign the atmosphere is primed to unload extreme amounts of rain, a phenomenon that is becoming more frequent in a warming world driven by human-caused climate change. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. It\u2019s not out of the question that one or two spots could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours. Texas and Louisiana have been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of torrential, flooding downpours since the start of April. Rainfall in the waterlogged area over the last two weeks is over 600% of what\u2019s typical, according to the WPC. Double-digit rainfall totals between 20 and 30 inches over the region in recent weeks have soaked the ground and left rivers swollen, priming the flood threat to extreme levels. Drenched soils are not expected to soak up any of Thursday\u2019s rainfall, the WPC warned Thursday morning. Widespread flash flooding could begin minutes after heavy rain starts to fall. Flooding ramps up Thursday but threat persists Friday Storms, some severe, rumbled to life Thursday afternoon in parts of Texas and prompted flash flood warnings for multiple cities, including Waco. Powerful, heavy storms will push south and east and reach Louisiana and Mississippi late in the day. Nearly 10 million people are under a tornado watch until 10 p.m. CT Thursday in portions of southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana, including Houston and Lake Charles, Louisiana. A large cluster of thunderstorms moving into the region Thursday afternoon brought with it a flash flood threat from the heavy downpours in addition to the severe storm dangers in the strongest cells. A couple of tornadoes could spawn, scattered damaging wind gusts are likely to reach 70 mph and there may be isolated hail up to 2 inches in diameter. More than a million customers across Texas are without electricity as of Thursday evening \u2013 including more than 800,000 outages reported in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to PowerOutage.us. Harris County is the third-most populous in the United States. A tornado warning had been issued earlier Thursday evening in Harris County, Texas, including downtown Houston, according to the National Weather Service. The weather service also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Houston with the highest-level \u201cdestructive\u201d tag. At around 6:30 p.m., the weather service in Houston noted a \u201cdestructive storm\u201d with wind gusts of up to 80 mph was over the metro area, and urged residents to take cover immediately in a post on X. Winds in the city were reported as high as 71 mph, according to the weather service.\u00a0On the east side of the city, there were reports of winds up to 78 mph. Winds exceeding 74 mph are equivalent to the strength of a Category 1 hurricane. Videos shared with CNN on Thursday showed heavy rainfall and power flashes impacting Houston\u2019s downtown area while howling winds could be heard in the city\u2019s Heights neighborhood. Houston Mayor John Whitmire advised residents to stay off the roads. \u201cThe mayor and first responders are asking Houstonians to stay off the roads and avoid all unnecessary travel. Many roads are impassible due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. \u201cThere are significant power outages and reports of damage across the city. We are working with Centerpoint, METRO and other regional partners to keep everyone safe.\u201d Rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour are possible in the heaviest storms, which could lead to life-threatening flash flooding, according to the WPC. Damaging winds, hail and a couple of tornadoes are also possible. The greatest flooding danger will come as storms train later Thursday. Training storms track through and deluge the same areas over and over, like a train pulling its cars over the same stretch of track. Serious flash flooding is likely in any areas caught under multiple storms unloading 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour. Roadways may quickly become rivers and small streams could easily overflow their banks. More than 35 million people in the South are under a Level 2 of 4 or Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Thursday. Many areas may only endure one torrential storm, but even brief downpours will be enough to cause flooding problems given how wet the South has been recently. Soaking storms will shift east on Friday and target more of the Gulf Coast. Significant portions of Mississippi and Alabama are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall on Friday. A larger area from the Texas/Louisiana border to Georgia and the Florida Panhandle is under a Level 2 of 4 risk. Drenching storms from Thursday night will likely last into Friday morning for parts of the Gulf Coast. An initial round of flash flooding is likely in the first half of Friday before rain starts to taper off in the afternoon. Another bout of heavy rain will develop Friday night and continue into the earliest hours of Saturday morning, working over the same areas hit earlier in the day. These storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Extremely wet start to the year The rain will only add to already extreme rainfall totals in what\u2019s been one of the wettest years to date on record across the Gulf Coast. Some Southeast cities have recorded more than half a foot of rain above what\u2019s typical for the first several months of the year. Several dozen cities from Texas to western Georgia are pacing at a top 5 wettest year to date and at least two cities in eastern Texas are experiencing their wettest year, according to the\u00a0Southeast Regional Climate Center. Dallas is experiencing its third-wettest year to date while Shreveport, Louisiana, is amid its second wettest. Excessive rainfall has largely eliminated dryness and drought conditions along the Gulf Coast, but it hasn\u2019t come without a cost. Earlier this month, nearly 2 feet of rain fell in just five days and sent parts of eastern Texas underwater. Hundreds of people and animals were rescued from flooding as some area\u00a0rivers rose to levels\u00a0not reached since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/weather/south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_slovakia-prime-minister-fico-shooting-intl", "text": "Slovakia\u2019s Prime Minister Robert Fico was rushed to hospital in critical condition on Wednesday after he was shot five times in an assassination attempt that shocked the country. The attack took place after an off-site government meeting in the central Slovak town of Handlova. The suspected gunman was among a small crowd of people waiting to greet the prime minister on the street outside the cultural center, where the meeting took place, local media reported. Footage from the scene shows the gunman approaching Fico and firing at him from close range across a security barrier. The injured prime minister is then seen being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Fico was taken to a local hospital and then transferred by helicopter to a major trauma center about 20 miles (30 kilometers) away in Banska Bystrica. No one else was injured in the attack, officials said. Both the country\u2019s Defense Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k and Interior Minister Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160utaj E\u0161tok called the shooting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d with \u0160utaj E\u0161tok saying that \u201cthe suspect made the decision to do it shortly after the presidential election.\u201d In an emotional news conference outside the hospital, the two ministers said Fico was \u201cfighting for his life\u201d after the shooting and had been, at that point, in surgery for three and half hours. Later in the evening, Slovakian deputy Prime Minister Tom\u00e1\u0161 Taraba said he believed the prime minister would survive following surgery that \u201cwent well\u201d and was \u201cnot in a life-threatening situation at this moment.\u201d \u201cI was very shocked and tried to contact people to figure out how serious his condition was,\u201d Taraba said in an interview with BBC\u2019s Newshour program on Wednesday, recalling the moment he heard about Fico\u2019s shooting. \u201cFortunately, as far as I know the operation went well and I guess in the end he will survive,\u201d he said. Taraba told the BBC that Fico \u201cwas heavily injured\u201d and a bullet \u201cwent through the stomach and the second one hit the joints.\u201d Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. The official statement posted on Fico\u2019s official Facebook said the PM was taken to Banska Bystrica instead of the capital city of Bratislava because \u201can acute intervention\u201d was necessary. Handlova is about two hours\u2019 drive from the capital Bratislava. Slovak President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 said the suspected gunman was detained by the police. She said law enforcement agencies will release more information when they can and asked the public not to spread unconfirmed rumors. \u010caputov\u00e1 condemned what she called a \u201cbrutal and reckless\u201d attack on the 59-year-old politician. Speaking at a news conference later in the afternoon, she said the shooting was \u201can attack on democracy as well.\u201d Slovakia\u2019s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. Speaking to reporters in front of the hospital where Fico is being treated, Defense Minister Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said: \u201cHate is not an answer to hate.\u201d Visibly shaken and struggling for words at multiple moments during the news conference, Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said it was \u201ctime for some people to have a hard look into the mirror.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that this was politically motivated. The inability to accept the choice of people, which some may not like \u2026 it leads to this,\u201d he said. Interior Minister \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok called for calm, saying \u201cthose who are endorsing this attack as well as those who are calling for some sort of a revenge. And I am asking you, the media too, please, use your power, your influence. Because until now, it was some of you who sow the hate,\u201d he said. Following the shooting, \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok said the country is \u201cexperiencing the worst day of its democracy.\u201d \u201cFor the first time in the 31 years of our democratic sovereign republic, someone has decided to express a political opinion not in an election but with a gun on the street,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country\u2019s direction and position in the world since Fico\u2019s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. The country has seen weeks of largely peaceful protests over his coalition government\u2019s controversial domestic reforms. The government is also trying to shut down public service broadcaster RTVS and plans to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. Felt like a \u2018nightmare\u2019 Social media footage appeared to show the moment Fico was attacked. As he approaches a crowd of people, a man is seen lunging towards Fico with what appears to be a gun pointed at him.  Five shots are heard and Fico falls to the ground. An eyewitness who was at the scene where Fico was shot said the attack felt like a \u201cnightmare\u201d after hearing three \u201cquick\u201d shots, fired one after the other as if you were to \u201cthrow a firecracker on the ground.\u201d \u201cI heard three shots, it was quick one by one like if you throw a firecracker on the ground,\u201d eyewitness\u00a0Lubica Valkova told Reuters, adding that \u201che (Fico) fell next to the barrier.\u201d \u201cI think it is a nightmare, I\u2019ll tell you I think I will not wake up from this,\u201d the 66-year-old said. \u201cThat this is not possible to happen in\u00a0Slovakia.\u201d Valkova said she had been waiting a long time to shake Fico\u2019s hand and was taking pictures of him when he walked out of the building in Handlova. \u201cAt this moment we heard something like a bang, we thought someone made a joke and threw a firecracker on the ground, that was my first reaction,\u201d Valkova recalled. The Slovak resident told Reuters she had been waiting from 10 a.m. local time. She claimed police did not search people who were waiting at the event, adding that \u201cwe could have shown our empty hands.\u201d Ally of Moscow In what was a stunning comeback for the controversial politician, Fico won a third term as Slovakian prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized western support for Ukraine. As prime minister, he made a major U-turn in Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine: Fico had pledged an immediate end to Slovak military support for Ukraine and promised to block Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions. Ahead of the election, Fico made no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and blamed \u201cUkrainian Nazis and fascists\u201d for provoking Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the\u00a0false narrative Russia\u2019s president\u00a0has used to justify his invasion. While in opposition, Fico became a close ally of Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, especially when it came to criticism of the European Union. Domestically, his coalition government is also pushing controversial reforms that have prompted weeks of large-scale peaceful protests. Attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system have been particularly controversial, as the government seeks to reduce penalties for corruption and has already abolished Slovakia\u2019s special prosecutor\u2019s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that involved people connected to Fico and his party SMER (\u201cDirection \u2013 Social Democracy\u201d). Fico previously served as Slovakia\u2019s prime minister for more than a decade, first between 2006 and 2010 and then again from 2012 to 2018. He was forced to resign in March 2018 after weeks of mass protests over the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1. Kuciak reported on corruption among the country\u2019s elite, including people directly connected to Fico and his party SMER. World leaders immediately condemned the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a telegram to Slovakia\u2019s president that \u201cthere can be no justification for this monstrous crime\u201d and wished Fico a speedy and complete recovery. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted: \u201cI strongly condemn the vile attack on Prime Minister Robert Fico. Such acts of violence have no place in our society and undermine democracy, our most precious common good.\u201d And Hungarian Prime Minister Orban added: \u201cI was deeply shocked by the heinous attack against my friend, Prime Minister Robert Fico. We pray for his health and quick recovery!\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed \u201csolidarity with the people of Slovakia\u201d following the \u201cappalling\u201d assault on Fico. US President Joe Biden said he was \u201calarmed\u201d by the attempted assassination of Fico, calling it a \u201chorrific act of violence.\u201d \u201cJill and I are praying for a swift recovery, and our thoughts are with his family and the people of Slovakia,\u201d he said in a statement. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he \u201cstrongly condemns the shocking attack.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "travel_arabian-travel-market-middle-east-travel-spc", "text": "Last week, travel and tourism industry representatives from more than 150 countries gathered at the annual Arabian Travel Market trade show, held this year in Dubai. There, CNN\u2019s Eleni Giokos spoke with Julia Simpson, president of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), about trends in tourism in the Middle East, and the challenge of making travel more sustainable. The interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. CNN: The tourism sector is flourishing in many parts of this region and also coming under pressure in others. Tell me about the macro trends that you\u2019re seeing right now. Julia Simpson: Well, it\u2019s really interesting because travel isn\u2019t just back, it\u2019s absolutely booming. We are here in the Middle East \u2014 this is the first time I\u2019ve been to the Arabian Travel Market \u2014\u00a0but what\u2019s interesting is everyone\u2019s telling me they have never, ever seen it this busy. So I think that is actually very, very descriptive of what we are seeing globally: a very strong market everywhere for travel and tourism. CNN: But in terms of the interest and demand for the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council nations) and for the Middle East as a whole, have you ever seen this kind of demand before? Simpson: Well, the GCC and Middle East is growing faster than any other region. The Saudis just celebrated their 100 millionth visitor, Dubai is just announcing a brand-new airport, which is stunning, and visitors are flocking to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ras Al-Khaimah here in the (United Arab Emirates). We are seeing revenue numbers have gone up by 50% and the contribution to GDP \u2014 in terms of the amount of money that travel and tourism is making and contributing to the economy \u2014 has gone up by 25%. It\u2019s very, very strong. So the whole of the region is doing very well. CNN: Why do you think that is? Is it the product offering? Is it because it basically is still a frontier market in many places, where other destinations have been so popular for such a long time? Simpson: I think there are two things playing here. First of all, Dubai is now very well established globally. People come here, they know it\u2019s safe, they know they can have a great time, very high-quality, good cuisine, good art, interesting culture. And then the rest of the GCC is really developing. So in Saudi (Arabia), the project in Diriyah is incredible. They have taken an old Saud family castle and rebuilt it and it now has literally hundreds of thousands of visitors. So it\u2019s happening everywhere. I think the other trend is people are looking for authenticity. People are really interested to visit the area, find out what\u2019s going on \u2014 in Saudi Arabia, you\u2019ve got rewilding of a million trees, you\u2019ve got green mountains, and I think one of my favorites is Oman, I\u2019ve got to say. It\u2019s just such a wonderful country and Oman goes quite far south, so that when it gets very, very hot in the Middle East, people go to the south of Oman to have the green hills. It is an amazing, very rich area. Climate impact CNN: We\u2019ve had unprecedented flooding in the region \u2014 we saw that happening in the UAE, specifically Dubai was hard hit, so sustainability is top of mind now. Is it more so than ever before for this region? Simpson: It is true, we are seeing more big climate events globally \u2014 everywhere. So I think it\u2019s really important that when we look at travel and tourism, we understand what our impact is on the climate. No one knew what (the travel sector\u2019s) impact was before, but we\u2019ve (the World Travel and Tourism Council) worked with the Saudis and Oxford Economics and now we know exactly that we contribute, in our sector, 8% to global greenhouse gas emissions. But the interesting thing, now we\u2019ve got the data, is that we know where that\u2019s coming from. For example, the vast majority of our impact actually comes from ground vehicles. So that\u2019s all our ground vehicles, whether it\u2019s a little van that delivers raspberries to the hotel or the bus that gets you from the airport. So getting electrification globally is really important. Then, obviously, air travel. And air travel, you\u2019re going to get next-generation planes with much more efficient engines and also the production of sustainable aviation fuel. We are not producing enough of it globally now, but there are now targets to meet. The issue is, airlines aren\u2019t in charge of the fuel they use. They have to buy their fuel. So it\u2019s really important talking to countries to get them to invest in sustainable aviation fuel. CNN: I want to talk about the impact of conflict in the region and the war in Gaza. What can you tell us about the perceptions of risk? Simpson: First and foremost, when I talk about something like this, you have to remember it is a real human tragedy, and all our hearts go out to everybody involved in this horrific conflict. In terms of its impact on travel and tourism, the people who are right in the middle are obviously suffering a lot in terms of terms of tourists not wanting to go there. But slightly outside the area, areas are doing very well. Egypt has some very strong travel and tourism numbers because it\u2019s a big country. It depends where it is geographically. The Gulf has not been affected, as we can see by the numbers, but I think you\u2019re right, there is a general feeling and that can translate into numbers of visitors. But at the moment, outside the area that is directly affected, we are not seeing a big impact on travel and tourism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/arabian-travel-market-middle-east-travel-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_style_gina-rinehart-namatjira-portrait-australia-intl-scli", "text": "Art is subjective. And while many artists long to share their work with the world, there\u2019s no guarantee that the audience will understand it, or even like it. That certainly seems to be the case with a painting by indigenous artist Vincent Namatjira, which includes a portrait of Australia\u2019s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart. Rinehart has reportedly called for the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) to remove her portrait, one of 21 individual works that make up a single piece in Namatjira\u2019s exhibition \u201cAustralia in Colour,\u201d from display. The exhibition has been running at the gallery in the Australian capital, Canberra, since March. Other subjects in the piece include the late Queen Elizabeth II, American musician Jimi Hendrix, Australian Aboriginal rights activist Vincent Lingiari and the former Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison. Australian media has reported that Rinehart approached the NGA\u2019s director and chair to request the painting\u2019s removal. The NGA said in a statement to CNN Thursday that it \u201cwelcomes the public having a dialogue on our collection and displays.\u201d \u201cSince 1973, when the National Gallery acquired Jackson Pollocks\u2019 Blue Poles, there has been a dynamic discussion on the artistic merits of works in the national collection, and/or on display at the Gallery,\u201d the NGA statement continued. \u201cWe present works of art to the Australian public to inspire people to explore, experience and learn about art.\u201d Namatjira said in a statement that he paints \u201cpeople who are wealthy, powerful, or significant \u2013 people who have had an influence on this country, and on me personally, whether directly or indirectly, whether for good or for bad.\u201d \u201cI paint the world as I see it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, \u2018why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?\u2019\u201d \u201cSome people might not like it, other people might find it funny but I hope people look beneath the surface and see the serious side too,\u201d Namatjira added. Rinehart is the executive chairman of Hancock Prospecting, a privately owned mining company that was founded by her father, Lang Hancock. CNN has reached out to Hancock Prospecting for comment but did not receive a response. Rinehart has an estimated net worth of $30.2 billion USD, according to Forbes. She \u201cremained unshakable\u201d at the top of Forbes\u2019 Australia\u2019s 50 Richest list for 2024, the outlet reported in February. Australia\u2019s National Association for the Visual Arts (NAVA) has spoken out to support Namatjira, CNN\u2019s affiliate 9News has reported. \u201cWhile Rinehart has the right to express her opinions about the work, she does not have the authority to pressure the gallery into withdrawing the painting simply because she dislikes it,\u201d NAVA\u2019s executive director Penelope Benton said, according to 9News. NAVA offered its \u201cunwavering support\u201d to National Gallery of Australia, 9News reported, stating that it was concerned that Rinehart\u2019s demand to remove the portrait \u201csets a dangerous precedent for censorship and the stifling of creative expression.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/gina-rinehart-namatjira-portrait-australia-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_australia_university-palestinian-protests-melbourne-intl-hnk", "text": "Pro-Palestinian protesters occupying a building at the University of Melbourne have been told to leave by university officials, who say they\u2019ve \u201ccrossed a line\u201d by entering the building and disrupting class for thousands of students. \u201cStudents have a right to protest but that is not a blank check,\u201d said the university\u2019s Deputy Vice Chancellor Michael Wesley in a video message distributed to media on Thursday. \u201cThey have crossed a line when they have occupied the Arts West building \u2026 the university\u2019s patience is now at an end.\u201d On Wednesday, students at the university were among thousands who rallied across the country to remember the 1948 al-Nakba or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d when around 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel. Dana Alshaer, from UniMelb for Palestine, said after the rally a smaller group of students \u201cindependently\u201d decided to occupy the Arts West building, and others supported them. Several banners have since been hung around the room, including one renaming the building \u201cMahmoud\u2019s Hall\u201d after Mahmoud Alnaouq, a Palestinian student who had won a scholarship to study in Australia but was killed in Gaza last October. Around 1:30pm on Wednesday, Deputy Vice Chancellor Pip Nicholson addressed the group inside the building on a loudspeaker, telling them their choices that afternoon would have \u201cserious consequences.\u201d According to a video posted online, she said: \u201cIn the event that you are not out of here within an hour \u2026 the university will make decisions that will regrettably and unavoidably escalate the tension.\u201d On the video, protesters said they wouldn\u2019t leave until the university responded to their demands, which include divesting from weapons companies and condemning Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. \u201cWe come in peace,\u201d a protester said off-camera. \u201cWe came here to learn, to study, to make an impact on the world, and the fees that we\u2019re paying are going towards companies committing an act of genocide right now. Speak to us about that.\u201d By Thursday, more than 150 classes had been cancelled, affecting 6,000 students and staff, the university said. Victoria Police said it was monitoring the protest activity and hadn\u2019t been asked to intervene. Alshaer denied reports students had blocked the building\u2019s doors and said the university had disabled them. \u201cThe people here are opening the doors for anyone, students and uni staff to come in and out whenever they want. It\u2019s not closed. It\u2019s not barricaded,\u201d she said. Tension building after weeks of protest Since the first tents appeared at universities in Australia over three weeks ago, more students have joined the protest action, demanding the institutions cut ties with weapons companies linked to Israel\u2019s attacks. More than 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a war against Hamas after its October 7 attack in southern Israel, according to health officials. The Hamas attack killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage. Around 100 are still in captivity and Hamas\u2019 top leadership is still at large despite the Israeli onslaught. Protests in support of both sides have flared around the world, with a widespread pro-Palestinian movement launching demonstrations at university colleges. So far, protest sites in Australia have remained relatively peaceful, unlike sister sites in the United States, where police violently evicted some students amid clashes with counter-protesters. Other universities in Melbourne and Canberra have put students on notice to leave. Protesters at\u00a0Deakin University\u00a0said Thursday they\u2019d received a second order to dismantle their camp on Thursday, in a letter shared with CNN that warned that failure to comply may constitute an act of student misconduct. Jasmine Duff, from Students for Palestine Victoria, told CNN the students had no intention of leaving. \u201cWe refuse to obey the directives of a university which is profiting from weapons research during a genocide,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, at least seven student protesters at Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra\u00a0have received letters from the university telling them to leave the site by the end of Friday. In the letter, shared with CNN by the university, students\u00a0were told the institution had received\u00a0\u201creports regarding the negative impact of the encampment on the wellbeing and safety of the broader University community,\u201d without specifying what they were. In a statement,\u00a0ANU said it supports students\u2019 right to protest but said \u201cthese activities must be safe and not cause unnecessary harm or damage to our campus or community.\u201d One of the letter\u2019s recipients, Nick Reich, said he and others are weighing their options. \u201cWe have to make the decision about how much and to what extent we participate in the protests against the university\u2019s investments in arms companies supplying Israel, but we can be certain that the encampment itself is going to remain set up and will continue to fight this fight,\u201d he said. In his video message distributed by the University of Melbourne, Wesley called on protesters to \u201cpeacefully end the occupation.\u201d \u201cRed lines have been crossed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\u00a0occupation is now seriously disruptive and seriously intimidating for the vast majority of our staff and students who have nothing to do with the protests and are not interested in the protests.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/australia/university-palestinian-protests-melbourne-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_americas_haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam", "text": "On the rare days that the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince fall silent, people notice. \u201cIf you can\u2019t hear shooting somewhere, the gangs are probably running low on ammunition,\u201d a police source in the\u00a0Haitian capital told CNN. \u201cBut when there\u2019s a lot of shooting, they\u2019ve definitely received a fresh shipment.\u201d For over two months, Port-au-Prince has been cut off from the world, its international seaport and airport shuttered following an explosion of gang attacks in late February. All major roads are blocked by gang checkpoints. For most people living here, there is no way out \u2013 and no way to bring in desperately needed food and medicine. Encircling the Caribbean nation is another closed perimeter, this one created by\u00a0Haiti\u2019s neighbors. The Dominican Republic has sealed the island\u2019s shared border and airspace. The Bahamas has launched\u00a0a naval blockade\u00a0to keep\u00a0Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has\u00a0sent a warship\u00a0to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has\u00a0increased marine and aviation patrols. And yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country \u2013 most of the firepower originating from the US. \u201cHaiti\u00a0doesn\u2019t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don\u2019t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,\u201d says Pierre Esperance, executive director of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s National Human Rights Defense Network. Since the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts. \u201cWe have to cut the gangs\u2019 weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,\u201d the police source told CNN. \u201cBecause when they don\u2019t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.\u201d And as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to\u00a0Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O\u2019Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti. \u201cAll of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.\u201d Defying a global arms embargo Eighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed\u00a0an arms embargo on\u00a0Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a\u00a0special unit\u00a0to investigate transnational crimes in\u00a0Haiti. Yet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that\u00a0Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being \u201croutinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports\u201d in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials. The following month,\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement. \u201cThe planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,\u201d Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo. But amid today\u2019s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls. \u201cThere are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,\u201d Vitel\u2019homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Bary\u00e9 gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower. Weapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN\u2019s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil \u2013 and, overwhelmingly, from the United States. An \u2018iron river\u2019 from the United States The guns\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts. From 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States,\u00a0UNODC\u00a0reported in January,\u00a0citing the most-recent available tracing data. \u00a0They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through \u201cstraw man\u201d intermediaries, the agency also found. It\u2019s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the \u201ciron river\u201d \u2013 a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels. A senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to\u00a0Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks. \u201cThose are difficult to enforce because they\u2019re not your typical commercial freighter\u2026 it\u2019s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,\u201d he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added. Asked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. \u201cIt is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF\u2019s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like\u00a0Haiti\u00a0where the rule of law is under extreme threat.\u201d In January, Joly Germine \u2013 leader of the gang 400 Mawozo \u2013 pleaded guilty to\u00a0US charges over a gunrunning scheme\u00a0that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into\u00a0Haiti. Land of mountains From above, traces of Haiti\u2019s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave. Sea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while\u00a0Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this \u201cland of mountains\u201d add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency. Haiti\u2019s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. \u201cHere, you don\u2019t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of\u00a0Haitian jurisdiction,\u201d a\u00a0security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN. The sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo.\u00a0Haiti\u2019s roughly horseshoe shape offers\u00a0over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for\u00a0Haiti\u2019s coast guard. Haiti\u2019s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region. \u201cOne popular method of moving illegal products involves \u201cbanana boats,\u201d go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,\u201d the UNODC report details. Guns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as \u201cmajor players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.\u201d In 2022, 5 Segond group attacked\u00a0Haiti\u2019s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur. Today, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions. \u201cIzo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang\u2026 and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,\u201d the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond\u2019s rapper frontman\u00a0Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media. Containers and corruption Contraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month,\u00a0Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized\u00a0more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges\u00a0from a shipping container that had arrived\u00a0in Haiti\u2019s northern city of Cap\u00a0Haitien. Drugs and arms smuggling has a long history in\u00a0Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince. Customs officials\u00a0trying to do their job\u00a0on the front lines in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and\u00a0Haiti\u00a0were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection. Allegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s government. Four former\u00a0Haitian senators\u00a0have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of\u00a0Haiti\u00a0for allegedly financing the country\u2019s gangs. They\u2019re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country\u2019s \u201coligarchs,\u201d who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes. \u201cAs a\u00a0Haitian human rights defender, I can\u2019t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US \u2013 I think it\u2019s the\u00a0Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,\u201d says Esperance, the human rights advocate. That\u2019s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country\u2019s elite. \u201cNow, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it\u2019s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,\u201d Esperance said. Bertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up\u00a0Haiti\u2019s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country\u2019s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners. \u201cIt\u2019s time for people in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0to live peacefully \u2013 for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.\u201d And that means, she says, ensuring that \u201cnational authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.\u201d CNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti\u2019s National Police and Haiti\u2019s General Customs Administration for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/americas/haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_tech_schumer-ai-framework", "text": "Federal legislation to govern artificial intelligence took another step closer to reality on Wednesday as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with a bipartisan trio of senators, announced a sprawling blueprint to shape how congressional committees tackle the technology in forthcoming bills. The 31-page roadmap released this week calls for billions of dollars in government spending to accelerate AI research and development, reflecting earlier commitments by Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and the so-called \u201cAI gang\u201d to prioritize US innovation in an intensely competitive field. It also instructs multiple Senate committees to come up with guardrails for AI to address some of its biggest risks, such as AI-enabled discrimination, job displacement and election interference. \u201cHarnessing the potential of AI demands an all-hands-on-deck approach and that\u2019s exactly what our bipartisan AI working group has been leading,\u201d Schumer said Wednesday. Some of the document\u2019s proposals reflect longstanding congressional goals, such as the creation of a national data privacy law that gives consumers more control over their personal information and which could help regulate AI companies\u2019 use of such data. Others appear modeled after legislation adopted by the European Union, such as a proposed ban on the use of AI for social scoring systems akin to those implemented by the Chinese government. And it urges congressional committees to develop coherent policies for when and how to impose export controls on \u201cpowerful AI systems\u201d \u2014 or for designating certain AI models as classified for national security purposes. The roadmap endorses a recommendation to allocate at least $32 billion a year, or at least 1% of US GDP, on AI research and development, a proposal issued in a 2021 report by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. The organizing plan developed over months of meetings and listening sessions with top tech companies, civil rights leaders, labor unions and intellectual property holders. And it seeks to reinvigorate a legislative push that began last year, after Schumer took a personal role in spearheading the effort along with New Mexico Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich and Republican Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Todd Young of Indiana. \u201cThis roadmap represents the most comprehensive and impactful bipartisan recommendations on artificial intelligence ever issued by the legislative branch,\u201d Young said Wednesday. The latest plan highlights how Senate leaders are trying to move from a learning phase to an action phase, by issuing assignments to committees to craft legislation that may be passed piecemeal. Schumer has previously said that with the 2024 elections fast approaching, he may make it a top priority to pass legislation aimed at protecting the elections from AI-driven interference. Schumer has described regulating artificial intelligence as a challenge for Congress unlike any other, vowing a swift timeline measured in months, not years. But policy analysts, and some congressional aides, doubt whether Congress can pass significant legislation regulating AI in an election year. Meanwhile, the European Union has surged ahead with AI regulation, giving final approval in March to the trading bloc\u2019s landmark EU AI Act that bans certain AI applications altogether and imposes significant restrictions on others deemed to be \u201chigh-risk.\u201d On Wednesday, some in the tech industry applauded the Senate roadmap\u2019s release. \u201cThis AI policy roadmap is an encouraging start, focusing on defending the screen and recording industries against the use of unauthorized replicas,\u201d said Dana Rao, general counsel and chief trust officer at Adobe. \u201cIt will be important for governments to provide protections across the wider creative ecosystem.\u201d Rao urged lawmakers to pass legislation enshrining a national right against impersonation to protect artists from AI-generated clones of themselves. \u201cTechnology is borderless, and as a global leader in innovation, the US needs a clear national AI policy with guardrails so American innovation in AI can safely flourish,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association. Some consumer advocates were more critical, saying the roadmap was vague in its recommendations for addressing AI risks. \u201cThe framework eagerly suggests pouring Americans\u2019 tax dollars into AI research and development for military, defense, and private sector profiteering. Meanwhile, there\u2019s almost nothing meaningful around some of the most important and urgent AI policy issues like the technology\u2019s impact on policing, immigration, and worker\u2019s rights,\u201d said Evan Greer, director of the advocacy group Fight For the Future, adding that the document \u201creads like it was written by Sam Altman and Big Tech lobbyists.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/tech/schumer-ai-framework/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

{"id": "2024_05_16_europe_vovchansk-evacuation-ukraine-russia-intl-latam", "text": "In a recurring nightmare, horrors usually repeat themselves. For the Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk, they\u2019re getting worse. Every street seems aflame. The shelling is constant. Torn up tanks and Humvees litter its streets. Small arms fire can be heard as Russian forces inch forwards. Locals in the town lived through occupation and liberation for seven grueling months in 2022. But now they bear the brunt of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s race to grab as much land as he can before Ukraine eventually feels the benefit of US weapons arriving. Moscow on Friday launched its most surprising operation since the initial invasion, crossing Ukraine\u2019s northern border, in a repeat attempt to push south towards the country\u2019s second most-populous city. The devastating weight of the offensive has torn Vovchansk up. The Russian military claims the action has left close to a dozen villages under its control. Most consequentially, Kyiv is now scrambling to send forces from other over-stretched frontlines where Russia is also seeing progress, to stop Moscow\u2019s guns getting in range of Kharkiv city proper. In Vovchansk, the onslaught means that one local man Mykola, his wife, and his 85-year-old mother are for the first time leaving behind the house they built and lived in for 40 years. They were one of 35 groups of residents who called the Ukrainian authorities Thursday and asked to be rescued before Russian troops \u2013\u00a0now just a few hundred meters to the north \u2013 reach their door front. The sounds of artillery shells echoes off the cinderblock walls as a young police officer pulls up outside their house. Mykola walks out, trips on rubble in his yard, and curses. \u201cHop in!\u201d says the police officer, Maksim, as he hustles the family and their few possessions toward the car. He\u2019s been driving into the town continuously since Russia\u2019s advance, shuttling people out. He moves fast. The smell of burning homes hangs in the air, and smoke clogs out the sunlight \u2013 the remnants of the artillery shells that rain down on houses day and night. Mykola and his wife grab plastic bags of eggs, and shuffle across their vegetable patch. The airstrikes last night were just too much, they admit. Less than five minutes later, they\u2019re away, dodging the potholes and rubble that litter the street. At a roundabout on the edge of town, an aging Soviet-era fighter jet, once a proud display of military prowess past, has been knocked off its pedestal. They swerve between the charred body and turret of a Ukrainian tank that\u2019s been blown apart \u2013 recently enough that its ammunition spills out onto the street, untouched. Fifteen minutes down the road, they pull into a gas station. With a wide smile, 85-year-old Maria walks haltingly to an awaiting police van. \u201cIt\u2019s not scary,\u201d she says of the shelling. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it.\u201d Her family admits she is hard of hearing, and so the intensity of the bombardment may not have impacted her as much. Yet she still had reached her limit. She sits next to her former neighbor, Inna. \u201cAt night, they dropped so many aerial bombs,\u201d she says. \u201cHorrible.\u201d Friends of theirs, who now volunteer to extract residents, tried to reach them the previous day but had to turn back. \u201cThey were shooting close to us. Firing at everything,\u201d said Inna. Harrowing memories of Russian control They recall their months under Russian occupation in 2022 \u2013 living under the military control of a country they had for decades lived amicably with, mere kilometers away from them across the border. Mykola\u2019s wife said of the occupation: \u201cIt was alright. They didn\u2019t touch us. They did touch other residents.\u201d Yet Inna recalls how the Russians sought out Ukrainian soldiers who had fought against Russian forces and their proxies in the first phase of the war in 2014. \u201cThey mostly tortured the boys who served. We have a factory there, where they had a prison. The Russians held our boys there.\u201d \u00a0There has been widespread reporting of mistreatment of Ukrainian civilians under Russian occupation, allegations the Kremlin has typically dismissed as fake. As soon as they\u2019ve dropped the residents off, the police set off again for Vovchansk. Just past the town entrance, they pull off into a line of trees. Sitting at a picnic table, they examine a map and assess which of the three rescue calls they can answer. Only one group of people requesting their help is accessible, they assess. Yet their debate is interrupted by a low whining noise. Is it a drone? They peer from beneath the tree cover upwards.\u00a0 The noise comes and goes. But then a drone is spotted \u2013 one of three. A larger one that hovers, and two other smaller devices that race around. The two policemen point their weapons at the sky. \u201cOver us!\u00a0 Look!\u201d one says. \u201cShould I f*** it up?\u201d he asks a colleague. \u201cWhat if it is ours?\u201d he replies. If the police open fire, they may actually draw the attention of the drone on them. The wait is nerve-shredding. The noise grows. The police and the CNN crew can only hope they are either obscured by the trees, or considered not an important enough target for the Russian drone. It does appear fixated on something else nearby. But then the noise grows louder. It is time to leave.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/europe/vovchansk-evacuation-ukraine-russia-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
